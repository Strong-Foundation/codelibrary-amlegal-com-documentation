as proposed under CUP No. 2020-02 and SPDR No. 2020-02. 
 
B.   The following findings of Section 15152 of the CEQA Guidelines can be met
as follows:
 
1.   The project is consistent with the program, policy, plan, or ordinance for
which the previous EIR or MND was prepared.
The approved project included the development of the subject site with
commercial uses and anticipated subsequent rezone and general plan amendment
requests to allow the proposed development.
 
2.   The project is consistent with the general plan and zoning of the
applicable city or county.
The proposed project will result in an amendment to both the General Plan and
the Zoning Diagrams, resulting in consistency between the project and the
Highway Service Commercial land use designations.
 
3.   The project, as revised or mitigated, will not result in any significant
effects which were not examined in the previous EIR.
The project is intended to conduct the land use entitlement of the original
proposal. There were no significant effects identified through the City’s
consultation process of the proposed general plan and rezone application.
 
C.   General Plan Consistency. The amendment made to the Livingston Zoning Map
pursuant to this Ordinance is consistent with the adopted 1999 General Plan, as
amended, and as is documented in the associated staff report and file. This
Zoning Amendment will not cause any conflict with the City’s General Plan.
 
D.   As demonstrated in the associated staff report, the requested rezoning
will allow the applicant to proceed with the development of the project site
with commercial uses, which is beneficial, provides business opportunities, and
responds to market demand.
E.   The uses proposed are not expected to be detrimental to present and
planned uses.
 
SECTION 3.     No Mandatory Duty of Care. This Ordinance is not intended to and
shall not be construed or given effect in a manner that imposes upon the City,
or any officer or employee thereof, a mandatory duty of care towards persons or
parties within the City or outside of the City so as to provide a basis of
civil liability for damages, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
SECTION 4.     Severability. If any provision of this Ordinance or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such
invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the Ordinance
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application. To this
end, the provisions of the Ordinance are severable. This City Council hereby
declares that it would have adopted this Ordinance irrespective of the
invalidity of any particular portion thereof.
 
SECTION 5.     Effective Date. This Ordinance shall take effect and be in full
force and effect thirty (30) days after its final passage and adoption.

§ 1-7-5 DECLARATION OF INTENT.
   In enacting this chapter, the City Council finds and declares that state law
recognizes that these are limited circumstances in which the protection of
confidentiality of intergovernmental communications is considered more
important than the right of the people to be informed. Specifically,
maintaining the confidentiality of communications between the city and its
attorney and management staff promotes the candor necessary to receiving the
best advice in matters in which such advice is sought. Furthermore the purpose
behind closed sessions of the City Council authorized by the Ralph M. Brown Act
is thwarted unless communications made pursuant to the act remain confidential.
A breach of the confidentiality of such communications interferes with
effective governmental operation and the protection of legitimate privacy
interests of the city and its employees.

(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-2 OBJECTIVE OF POLICY.
   (A)   The primary objective of this investment policy is to achieve the
highest yield possible without assuming unacceptable levels of risk while
maintaining a liquidity position sufficient to meet current and anticipated
cash needs. The following major guidelines are used to achieve the primary
objective of the investment policy:
      1.   Investment authority and responsibility;

(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-3 LEGAL AUTHORITY.
   Pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 53607, the City Manager and Finance Director
as chief fiscal officers are authorized to undertake investment transactions on
behalf of the city.
   (A)   Security purchases and holdings are maintained within statutory limits
imposed by the Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 53600 et seq.
   (B)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances
then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable income to be derived.
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-4 AVAILABLE INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS.
   (A)   Government agency issues. As authorized in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 53601(a)
through (e), this category includes a wide variety of government securities.
There are no portfolio limitations on the amount or maturity period for these
investment vehicles, which include the following:
      1.   Local government bonds or other indebtedness;
      2.   State bonds or other indebtedness;
      3.   U.S. treasury notes or other indebtedness secured by the full faith
and credit of the federal government; and
      4.   Other federal agency securities such as issued by the Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA), Federal National Mortgage Association
(FNMA) and small business administration.
   (B)   Bankers’ acceptances.
      1.   As provided in Cal. Gov’t Code § 53601(g), 40% of the city’s
portfolio may be invested in bankers’ acceptances that are eligible for
purchase by the federal reserve system, although no more than 30% of the
portfolio may be invested in bankers’ acceptances with any one commercial bank.
      2.   Additionally, the maturity period cannot exceed 270 days; however,
bankers’ acceptances are seldom marketed with maturities in excess of 180 days.
   (C)   Commercial paper. As authorized in Cal. Gov’t Code § 53601(h), 15% of
the city’s portfolio may be invested in “prime” commercial paper as rated by
Moody’s or Standard and Poor’s with maturities not to exceed 180 days. This
percentage may be increased to 30% if the dollar weighted average maturity does
not exceed 31 days. There are a number of other qualifications regarding
investments in commercial paper based on the financial strength of the
corporation and the size of the investment.
   (D)   Negotiable certificates of deposit. As authorized in Cal. Gov’t Code §
53601(i), the city may invest 30% of its portfolio in negotiable certificates
of deposit issued by commercial banks. There is no limitation on the maturity
period for this investment vehicle.
   (E)   Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.
      1.   As authorized in Cal. Gov’t Code § 53601(j), these investment
vehicles are agreements between the local agency and seller for the purchase of
government securities to be resold at a specific date and for a specific
amount.
      2.   Repurchase agreements are generally used for short term investments
varying from one day to two weeks, although there is no legal limitation on the
maturity period or the amount. As provided in Cal. Gov’t Code § 53635, reverse
repurchase agreements require the prior approval of the city.
   (F)   Council financial futures and financial option contracts. As
authorized in Cal. Gov’t Code §53601(i), local agencies may invest in financial
futures or option contracts in any of the above investment categories subject
to the same overall portfolio limitations.
   (G)   Time certificates of deposit.
      1.   As authorized in Cal. Gov’t Code § 53652, certificates of deposit
are fixed term investments which are required to be collateralized 110% by
eligible pooled securities.
      2.   The pool is administered by the state, and is composed of a wide
variety of government securities, including those indicated above (except
municipal bonds), as well as promissory notes secured by first mortgages on
improved residential property located in the state. There are no portfolio
limits on the amount or maturity for this investment vehicle.
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-5 INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS.
   All investment vehicles allowed by Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 53601 and 53630 et
seq. may be used by the city with the exception of reverse repurchase
agreements. Exclusion of these vehicles is consistent with the city’s desire to
minimize risk. Although the possibility exists for greater earnings with these
vehicles, it is believed that the potential level of risk exceeds their
benefits.
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-6 GENERAL INVESTMENT GUIDELINES.
   The criteria employed by the Treasurer in the selection of investment
instruments in their order of importance are the following.
   (A)   Safety. The safety and risk associated with an investment refers to
the potential loss of principal, accrued interest or a combination of these.
The city employs investment instruments which are considered safe. The primary
duty of the Treasurer is to protect the cash and investments placed in his or
her trust on behalf of the citizens of the community.
   (B)   Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ability to convert investment
holdings to cash immediately with a minimal loss of principal or accrued
interest. This quality of an investment is important when the need for
unexpected funds suddenly occurs.
   (C)   Yield. Yield is the dollar earnings that investment provides. Yield
becomes important only after the fundamental requirements of safety and
liquidity have been met.
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-7 MITIGATING RISK OF PORTFOLIO LOSS.
   (A)   Diversification of instruments. The portfolio should consist of a mix
of various types of securities, issuers and maturities.
   (B)   Staggering of maturities. Investment maturities are scheduled in such
a manner so that adequate cash will be available to pay disbursement
obligations as they become due and payable.
   (C)   Cash flow requirements used to establish maturity. Projected cash flow
requirements are the primary factor to be used in determining investment
maturity terms. After cash flow needs have been met, yield considerations will
be the next factor used in determining maturity terms, with the expectation
that longer maturity periods will generally yield greater returns on
investments.
   (D)   Sale of investments before maturity. Investments may be sold prior to
maturity for cash flow or appreciation purposes; however, no investment shall
be made based on yields resulting from capital gains.
   (E)   Terms of investments. Investments longer than one year may be made if
consistent with the city’s cash flow needs and related intent of holding until
maturity.
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-8 TREASURY MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Pooled cash. Cash for all general city funds are consolidated into one
general bank account and invested on a pooled concept basis. Interest earnings
are allocated according to fund ledger balances.
   (B)   Competitive bids. Purchase and sale of securities are made on the
basis of competitive offers and bids.
   (C)   Time deposit placement. Insured $100,000 time deposits are not placed
with banks and/or savings and loan associations unless an office is maintained
in the state.
   (D)   Security marketability. The marketability (salability) of a security
is considered at the time of purchase, as the security may have to be sold
prior to maturity in order to meet unanticipated cash demands.
   (E)   TCD evaluation. Time certificates of deposit (TCD) are evaluated in
terms of FDIC or FSLIC coverage. For deposits in excess of the insured maximum
of $100,000, approved collateral at full market value is required, as
prescribed in the Cal. Gov’t Code 53652.
   (F)   NCD evaluation. Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCD) are evaluated
in terms of the credit worthiness of the issuer, as these deposits are
unsecured and uncollateralized promissory notes.
   (G)   Broker authorization. Investment transactions are executed only with
previously approved brokers/dealers.
   (H)   Financial capacity. The financial capacity and credit worthiness of
the financial institution shall be considered prior to the placement of city
investments.
   (I)   Safekeeping. Securities purchased from secondary brokers/dealers shall
be held in third party safekeeping by the Trust Department of the city’s bank,
or by another third party trustee designated by the City Treasurer. Securities
purchased from primary dealers shall be held in the name of local agency with
the trustee executing investment transactions as directed by the City
Treasurer.
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-9 EVALUATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
   (A)   Before the placement of an investment with any financial institution,
the city investigates the ability of that institution to meet its financial
obligations.
   (B)   Several criteria that portray the financial well being of an
institution are studied. Among these are:
      1.   Profitability. The first and simplest test of an institution’s
ability to meet its liabilities is to study profits or earnings history. An
institution that is losing money erodes its capital and could find insufficient
assets to offset depositors’ claims;
      2.   Capitalization. Capital is the owners’ or shareholders’ equity
investment (assets minus liabilities). A well capitalized firm can withstand
temporary losses and offers reassurance that cash will be available to redeem a
note or certificate;
      3.   Asset quality. Asset quality is a key analytical concern. Default
risk is greatest among institutions with deteriorating assets; and
      4.   Financial statement. To facilitate evaluation, the financial
institution shall submit audited financial statements prepared by an
independent certified public accountant to the city on an annual basis
prompting following the end of the institution’
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-10 ADMINISTRATIVE SAFEGUARDS.
   The city employs methods to ensure safe administration of its investment
program. Two main areas of concern are the following.
   (A)   Internal controls. The city attempts to separate the investment
placing function and the resultant accounting activity.
   (B)   Bonding. All employees involved in investment duties are properly
bonded.
(Ord. 342, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 1-13-11 REPORTING AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Monthly report. By law, the Treasurer must issue a monthly report to
the chief executive officer and legislative body of the city showing the type
of investment, institution, date of maturity, amount of deposit, current market
value for all securities with a maturity of more than 12 months, rate of
interest and other relevant data that may be requested.
   (B)   Annual report and review. The Treasurer shall prepare an annual report
for review with the legislative body showing average daily funds invested by
portfolio, interest earned, portfolio yield and average life. The report will
include yields on other comparable portfolios for comparison purposes. Other
topics for discussion will include the general condition of the portfolio,
outlook for future interest rates and planned strategy for executing investment
transactions. Such reviews and evaluations should result in a uniform portfolio
administration policy.

      (H)   The encouragement, promotion and assistance in the development and
expansion of local commerce, needed commercial and industrial facilities and
increased employment opportunities within the project area.
      (I)   The retention, relocation, and expansion of any businesses and
industries impacted by the freeway realignment.
      (J)   The creation of a more cohesive and unified Livingston community by
strengthening the physical, social and economic ties between residential,
commercial, industrial, recreational and public land uses within the project
area.
      (K)   The provision of a procedural and financial mechanism by which the
agency can assist, complement and coordinate public and private development,
redevelopment, revitalization and enhancement of the Livingston community.
   Section 2: The Council hereby finds and determines that:
      (A)   The project area is a blighted area, the redevelopment of which is
necessary to effectuate the public purposes declared in the California
community redevelopment law (Cal. Health and Safety Code §§ 33000 et seq.).
This finding is based upon the following conditions which characterize the
project area:
         (1)   The existence of unfit or unsafe buildings and structures due to
age, obsolescence, faulty interior arrangements or exterior spacing and mixed
character and shifting of uses;
         (2)   The existence of properties which suffer from deterioration and
disuse because of: inadequate public improvements, facilities, utilities and
open spaces, including inadequate and insufficient traffic circulation, parking
and street lights which cannot be remedied with private or governmental action
without redevelopment;
         (3)   The existence of properties which suffer from economic
dislocation, deterioration and disuse resulting from faulty planning;
         (4)   A lack of proper utilization of property, resulting in a
stagnant and unproductive condition of land potentially useful and valuable;
and
         (5)   A prevalence of economic maladjustment and impaired investment
evidenced by an increase in the number of vacant commercial buildings.
      (B)   It is further found and determined that such conditions are causing
and will increasingly cause a reduction and lack of proper utilization of the
area to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical, social and
economic burden on the city, which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed
or alleviated by private enterprise acting alone, requiring redevelopment in
the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the
city and the state. This finding is based on the fact that governmental action
available to the city without redevelopment would be insufficient to cause any
significant correction of the blighting conditions and that the nature and
costs of the public improvements and facilities required to correct the
blighting conditions are beyond the capacity of the city and cannot be
undertaken or borne by private enterprise acting alone or in concert with
available governmental action.
      (C)   The redevelopment plan will redevelop the project area in
conformity with the community redevelopment law and in the interests of the
public peace, health, safety and welfare. This finding is based upon the fact
that redevelopment of the project area will implement the objectives of the
community redevelopment law by aiding in the elimination and correction of the
conditions of blight, providing for planning, development, redesign, clearance,
reconstruction or rehabilitation of properties which need improvement and
providing for higher economic utilization of potentially useful land.
      (D)   The adoption and carrying out of the redevelopment plan is
economically sound and feasible. This finding is based on the fact that under
the redevelopment plan no public redevelopment activity will be undertaken
unless the agency can demonstrate that it has adequate revenue to finance the
activity.
      (E)   The redevelopment plan conforms to the general plan of the City of
Livingston. This finding is based on the finding of the Planning Commission
that the redevelopment plan conforms to the general plan for the City of
Livingston.
      (F)   The carrying out of the redevelopment plan will promote the public
peace, health, safety and welfare of the City of Livingston and will effectuate
the purposes and policy of the community redevelopment law. The finding is
based on the fact that redevelopment will benefit the project area by
correcting conditions of blight and by coordinating public and private actions
to stimulate development and improve the economic, social and physical
conditions of the project area.
      (G)   The condemnation of real property, as provided for in the
redevelopment plan, is necessary to the execution of the redevelopment plan,
and adequate provisions have been made for the payment for property to be
acquired as provided by law. This finding is based upon the need to ensure that
the provisions of the redevelopment plan will be carried out and to prevent the
recurrence of blight.
      (H)   The agency has a feasible method and plan for the relocation of
families and persons who might be displaced, temporarily or permanently, from
housing facilities in the project area. This finding is based upon the fact
that the redevelopment plan provides for relocation assistance according to
law.
      (I)   There are, or are being provided, within the project area or within
other areas not generally less desirable with regard to public utilities and
public and commercial facilities and at rents or prices within the financial
means of the families and persons who might be displaced from the project area,
decent, safe and sanitary dwellings equal in number to the number of and
available to such displaced families and persons and reasonably accessible to
their places of employment. This finding is based upon the fact that no person
or family will be required to move from any dwelling unit until suitable
replacement housing is available.
      (J)   Inclusion of any lands, buildings or improvements which are not
detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare is necessary for the
effective redevelopment of the entire area of which they are a part, and any
such area is not included for the purpose of obtaining the allocation of tax
increment revenues from such area pursuant to Cal. Health and Safety Code §
33670 of the community redevelopment law without other substantial
justification for its inclusion. This finding is based upon the fact that the
boundaries of the project area were chosen as a unified and consistent whole to
include lands that were underutilized because of blighting influences, or
affected by the existence of blighting influences, and land uses significantly
contributing to the conditions of blight, whose inclusion is necessary to
accomplish the objectives and benefits of the redevelopment plan.
      (K)   The elimination of blight and the redevelopment of the project area
could not reasonably be expected to be accomplished by private enterprise
acting alone without the aid and assistance of the agency. This finding is
based upon the existence of blighting influences, including the lack of
adequate public improvements and facilities, and the inability of individual
developers to economically remove these blighting influences without
substantial public assistance in providing adequate public improvements and
facilities, and the inadequacy of other governmental programs and financing
mechanisms to eliminate blight, including the provision of necessary public
improvements and facilities.
      (L)   The redevelopment plan for the project area will afford the maximum
opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the city as a whole, for the
redevelopment of such area by private enterprise.
      (M)   The redevelopment plan contains adequate safeguards so that the
work of redevelopment will be carried out pursuant to the redevelopment plan,
and it provides for the retention of controls and the establishment of
restrictions and covenants running with the land sold or leased for private use
for periods of time and under conditions specified in the redevelopment plan,
which this Council deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the community
redevelopment law.
   Section 3: The Council is satisfied that permanent housing facilities will
be available within three years from the time occupants of the project area are
displaced, if any, and that pending the development of such facilities, there
will be available to any such displaced occupants temporary housing facilities
at rents comparable to those in the City of Livingston at the time of their
displacement. No persons or families of low or moderate income shall be
displaced from residences unless and until there is a suitable housing unit
available and ready for occupancy by such displaced persons or families at
rents comparable to those at the time of their displacement. Such housing units
shall be suitable to the needs of such displaced persons or families and must
be decent, safe, sanitary and otherwise standard dwellings. The agency shall
not displace any such persons or families until such housing units are
available and ready for occupancy.
   Section 4: The Council is convinced that the effect of tax increment
financing will not cause a severe financial burden or detriment on any taxing
agency deriving revenues from the project area.
   Section 5: Written objections to the redevelopment plan filed with the City
Clerk before the hour set for hearing and all oral objections presented to the
Council at the hearing having been considered are hereby overruled.
   Section 6: That certain document entitled “redevelopment plan for the
Livingston community redevelopment project”, the maps contained therein and
such other reports as are incorporated therein by reference, a copy of which is
on file in the office of the City Clerk, having been duly reviewed and
considered is hereby incorporated in this ordinance by reference and made a
part hereof, and as so incorporated is hereby designated, approved and adopted
as the official “redevelopment plan for the Livingston community redevelopment
project”.
   Section 7: In order to implement and facilitate the effectuation of the
redevelopment plan hereby approved, this Council hereby:
      (A)   Pledges its cooperation in helping to carry out the redevelopment
plan;
      (B)   Requests the various officials, departments, boards and agencies of
the city having administrative responsibilities in the project area likewise to
cooperate to such end and to exercise their respective functions and powers in
a manner consistent with the redevelopment of the project area;
      (C)   Stands ready to consider and take appropriate action upon proposals
and measures designed to effectuate the redevelopment plan; and
      (D)   Declares its intention to undertake and complete any proceeding
necessary to be carried out by the city under the provisions of the
redevelopment plan.
   Section 8: The City Clerk is hereby directed to send a certified copy of
this ordinance to the agency, whereupon the agency is vested with the
responsibility for carrying out the redevelopment plan.
   Section 9: The City Clerk is hereby directed to record with the County
Recorder of Merced County a description of the land within the project area and
a statement that proceedings for the redevelopment of the project area have
been instituted under the community redevelopment law.
   Section 10: The City Clerk is hereby directed to transmit a copy of the
description and statement recorded by the Clerk pursuant to Section 9 of this
ordinance, a copy of this ordinance and a map or plat indicating the boundaries
of the project area, to the Auditor and Assessor of the County of Merced, to
the governing body of each of the taxing agencies which receives taxes from
property in the project area and to the state board of equalization.
(Ord. 288, passed 9-12-1985, eff. 10-12-1985)
§ 1-16-2 AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE.
   Section 1: The purposes and intent of the City Council with respect to the
amended project area as it relates to the amendment is to accomplish the
following:
      (A)   Encourage employment opportunities through environmental and
economic improvements resulting from the redevelopment activities.
      (B)   Provide for the rehabilitation of commercial and industrial
structures and residential dwelling units.
      (C)   Provide for participation in the redevelopment of property in the
amended project area by owners who agree to so participate in conformity with
the amendment.
      (D)   Provide for the management of property owned or acquired by the
agency.
      (E)   Comply with the requirements of all applicable laws in providing
relocation assistance where agency activities result in displacement.
      (F)   Provide public infrastructure improvements and community
facilities, such as the installation, construction and/or reconstruction of
streets, overpasses, interchanges, utilities, public buildings, facilities,
structures, streetlighting, landscaping and other improvements which are
necessary for the effective redevelopment of the amended project area.
      (G)   Increase, improve and preserve the community’s supply of affordable
housing.
      (H)   Acquire real property.
      (I)   Dispose of real property acquired by the agency except property
conveyed to it by the city or any other public body.
      (J)   Encourage the redevelopment of the amended project area through the
cooperation of private enterprise and public agencies.
      (K)   Facilitate the retention, relocation, and expansion of any business
and industry impacted by the freeway realignment.
      (L)   Preserve and/or enhance historic structures that may be identified
within the amended project area.
   Section 2: The City Council hereby finds and determines, based on the
evidence in the record, including, but not limited to, the agency’s report to
the City Council on the proposed amendment, and all documents referenced
therein, and evidence and testimony received at the joint public hearing on
adoption of the amendment commencing on December 2, 1997, and the 1985
ordinance that:
      (A)   The added territory is a blighted area, the redevelopment of which
is necessary to effectuate the public purposes declared in the California
Community Redevelopment Law ([CCRL] Cal. Health and Safety Code §§ 33000 et
seq.).
         This finding is based on the following physical conditions of blight
which characterize the added territory:
         (1)   The existence of buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy
for persons to live or work, including buildings which exhibit dilapidation and
deterioration, defective design or physical construction, and other similar
factors such as age, adequate utilities and vacancy; and
         (2)   The existence of factors that prevent or substantially hinder
the economically viable use or capacity of buildings or lots, such as
substandard design, inadequately sized structures given present standards and
market conditions and other similar factors such as inadequate infrastructure,
inadequate freeway access, and obsolescence; and
         (3)   Adjacent or nearby uses that are incompatible with each other
and which prevent the economic development of those parcels or other portions
of the amended project area; and
         (4)   The existence of subdivided lots of irregular form and shape and
of inadequate size for proper usefulness and development that are in multiple
ownership.
         This finding is further based on the following economic conditions of
blight which characterize the added territory:
         (1)   Depreciated or stagnant values or impaired investments; and
         (2)   Abnormally high business vacancies, abnormally low lease rates,
high turnover rates, abandoned buildings and excessive vacant lots within an
area developed for urban use and served by utilities.
         (3)   Lack of necessary commercial facilities.
         This finding is further based on the condition of blight characterized
by the existence of inadequate public improvements, parking facilities or
utilities.
         Such conditions of physical and economic blight are so prevalent and
so substantial that they are now causing and will increasingly cause a
reduction and lack of proper utilization of the added territory to such an
extent that it constitutes a serious physical and economic burden on the city
which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by private
enterprise or governmental action, or both, without redevelopment. This finding
is based on the fact that governmental action available to the city without
redevelopment would be insufficient to cause any significant correction of the
blighting conditions, and that the nature and costs of the public improvements
and facilities and other actions required to correct the blighting conditions
are beyond the capacity of the city and cannot be undertaken or borne by
private enterprise acting alone or in concert with available governmental
action.
      (B)   Significant blight remains within the original project area, and
such blight cannot be eliminated without the extension of the time limits for
the establishment of debt by the agency. Blight remaining within the original
project area has been documented by the agency within the agency’s report to
the City Council.
         Such conditions are so prevalent and so substantial that they are now
causing, have caused and continue to cause, and will increasingly cause a
reduction and lack of proper utilization of the original project area to such
an extent that it constitutes a serious physical and economic burden on the
city which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by
private enterprise or governmental action, or both, without redevelopment. This
finding is based on the fact that governmental action available to the city
without redevelopment would be insufficient to cause any significant correction
of the blighting conditions, and that the nature and costs of the public
improvements and facilities and other actions required to correct the blighting
conditions are beyond the capacity of the city and cannot be undertaken or
borne by private enterprise acting alone or in concert with available
governmental action.
         This finding is further based on the City Council’s findings contained
in Section 2 of the 1985 ordinance, which found significant conditions of
blight within the original project area.
         Since the adoption of the ordinance, the agency has made efforts to
eliminate such conditions of blight by funding needed infrastructure, providing
housing and housing rehabilitation, public facilities, assisting existing
businesses and providing incentives for new development. However, the majority
of conditions described in the agency’s report to the City Council prepared for
the original project have not changed, and there continues to be a substantial
need to eliminate deficient public facilities and blighting conditions within
the original project area. Such conditions are causing and will increasingly
cause a reduction and lack of proper utilization of the original project area
to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical and economic burden on
the city which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by
private enterprise acting alone, requiring redevelopment in the interest of
health, safety and general welfare of the people of the city and the state.
This finding is based on the fact that governmental action available to the
city without redevelopment would be insufficient to cause any significant
correction of the blighting conditions, and that the nature and costs of the
public improvements and facilities and other actions required to correct the
blighting conditions are beyond the capacity of the city and cannot be
undertaken or borne by private enterprise acting alone or in concert with
available governmental action. Therefore, the agency has increased the time
limit on the establishing of loans, advances and indebtedness to finance, in
whole or in part, the original project for an additional period of time as
permitted in Cal. Health and Safety Code (CCRL) § 33333.6.
      (C)   The added territory is a predominantly urbanized area. This finding
is based upon the agency’s report to the City Council, which demonstrates that
not less than 80% of the land in the added territory has been or is developed
for urban uses. In addition, as demonstrated by the agency’s report to City
Council, the added territory is part of an area developed for urban uses.
      (D)   The amendment will redevelop the amended project area in conformity
with the CCRL and in the interests of the public peace, health and welfare.
This finding is based upon the fact that the purposes of the CCRL would be
attained by implementing the original plan, as amended by the amendment through
the following actions: by the elimination of areas suffering from economic
dislocation or disuse; by the replanning, redesign and/or redevelopment of
areas which are stagnant or improperly utilized, and which could not be
accomplished by private enterprise acting alone without public participation
and assistance; by protecting and promoting sound development and redevelopment
of blighted areas and the general welfare of the citizens of the city by
remedying such injurious conditions through appropriate means; and through the
installation of new or replacement of existing public improvements, facilities
and utilities in areas which are currently inadequately served with regard to
such improvements, facilities and utilities.
      (E)   The adoption and carrying out of the amendment is economically
sound and feasible. This finding is based on the fact that under the amendment
the agency will be authorized to seek and utilize a variety of potential
financing resources, including property tax increment; that the nature and
timing of public redevelopment assistance will depend on the amount and
availability of such financing resources, including tax increment, generated by
new investment in the amended project area; that under the amendment no public
redevelopment activity in the amended project area can be undertaken unless the
agency can demonstrate that it has adequate revenue to finance the activity;
and that the financing plan included within the agency’s report to the City
Council demonstrates that sufficient financial resources will be available to
carry out the amendment.
      (F)   The amendment is consistent with the general plan of the city,
including, but not limited to, the housing element of the general plan. This
finding is based on the finding of the Planning Commission that the amendment
conforms to the general plan for the city.
      (G)   The carrying out of the amendment will promote the public peace,
health, safety and welfare of the city and will effectuate the purposes and
policies of the CCRL. This finding is based on the fact that redevelopment will
benefit the amended project area by correcting conditions of blight and by
coordinating public and private actions to stimulate development and improve
the economic and physical conditions of the amended project area, and by
increasing employment opportunities within the city.
      (H)   The condemnation of real property, other than property on which any
persons reside, as provided for in the amendment, is necessary to the execution
of the amendment, and adequate provisions have been made for the payment for
property to be acquired as provided by law. This finding is based upon the need
to ensure that the provisions of the amendment will be carried out in part
through acquisition of property, other than property on which any persons
reside, by eminent domain if necessary, to prevent the recurrence of blight,
and the fact that no property will be acquired until adequate funds are
available to pay full compensation therefor.
      (I)   The agency has a feasible method and plan for the relocation of
families and persons who might be displaced, temporarily or permanently, from
housing facilities by agency actions other than eminent domain in the amended
project area. The agency also has a feasible method and plan for relocation of
businesses. This finding is based upon the fact that the agency has adopted a
plan for relocation of families, persons and businesses who may be displaced by
agency projects, the fact that the amendment provides for relocation assistance
according to law, and the fact that such assistance, including relocation
payments, constitutes a feasible method for relocation.
      (J)   There are, or are being provided, within the amended project area
or within other areas not generally less desirable with regard to public
utilities and public and commercial facilities and at rents or prices within
the financial means of the families and persons who might be displaced from the
amended project area, decent, safe and sanitary dwellings equal in number to
the number of and available to such displaced families and persons and
reasonably accessible to their places of employment. This finding is based upon
the provisions of the amendment which require that families and persons shall
not be displaced prior to the adoption of a relocation plan pursuant to Cal.
Health and Safety Code (CCRL) §§ 33411 and 33411.1, and that dwelling units
housing persons and families of low or moderate-income shall not be removed or
destroyed prior to the adoption of a replacement housing plan pursuant to Cal.
Health and Safety Code (CCRL) §§ 33334.5, 33413 and 33413.5.
      (K)   All noncontiguous areas of the amended project area are either
blighted or necessary for effective redevelopment and are not included for the
purpose of obtaining the allocation of taxes from the area pursuant to Cal.
Health and Safety Code (CCRL) § 33670 without other substantial justification
for their inclusion.
      (L)   Inclusion of any lands, buildings, or improvements which are not
detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare is necessary for the
effective redevelopment of the entire area of which they are a part, and any
such area is not included solely for the purpose of obtaining the allocation of
tax increment revenues from such area pursuant to Cal. Health and Safety Code
(CCRL) § 33670 without other substantial justification for its inclusion. This
finding is based on the fact that all properties within amended project area
boundaries were included because they were underutilized because of blighting
influences, or were affected by the existence of blighting influences, or were
necessary either to accomplish the objectives and benefits of the amendment or
because of the need to impose uniform requirements on the amended project area
as a whole. Such properties will share in the benefits of the amendment.
      (M)   The elimination of blight and the redevelopment of the amended
project area could not reasonably be expected to be accomplished by private
enterprise acting alone, or by governmental action, or both, without the aid
and assistance of the agency. This finding is based upon the existence of
blighting influences, including the lack of adequate public improvements and
facilities, and the inability of individual owners and developers to
economically remove these blighting influences without substantial public
assistance available pursuant to the CCRL.
      (N)   The City Council is satisfied that the time limitation and the
number of dollars to be allocated to the agency from the amended project area
are reasonably related to the successful implementation of the proposed
projects and programs, included as attachment G of the amended redevelopment
plan, and that implementation of the said projects and programs will enable the
agency to achieve its goals and objectives to eliminate blight within the
amended project area.
   Section 3: The City Council is satisfied that permanent housing facilities
will be available within three years from the time residential occupants of the
amended project area, if any, are displaced, and that pending the development
of such facilities, there will be available to any such displaced residential
occupants temporary housing facilities at rents comparable to those in the city
at the time of their displacement. This finding is based upon the City
Council’s finding that no persons or families of low and moderate income shall
be displaced from residences unless and until there are suitable housing units
available and ready for occupancy by such displaced persons or families at
rents comparable to those at the time of their displacement. Such housing units
shall be suitable to the needs of such displaced persons or families and must
be decent, safe, sanitary and otherwise standard dwellings.
   Section 4: Written objections to the amendment filed with the City Clerk
before the hour set for hearing and all written and oral objections presented
to the City Council at the hearing having been considered and, in the case of
written objections received from amended project area property owners and
affected taxing agencies having been responded to in writing all such
objections are hereby overruled.
   Section 5: The final EIR for the amendment, a copy of which is on file in
the office of the agency and in the office of the City Clerk, having been duly
reviewed and considered, is hereby incorporated into this ordinance by
reference and made a part hereof. All activities undertaken by the agency and/
or the city pursuant to or in implementation of the amendment shall be
undertaken in accordance with the mitigation measures and monitoring program
set forth in the final EIR, and the agency shall undertake such additional
environmental review or assessment as necessary under law at the time of the
proposed implementation of such activities.
   Section 6: That certain “amended redevelopment plan prepared for amendment
no. one to the redevelopment plan for the Livingston community redevelopment
project”, the map contained therein, and such other reports as are incorporated
therein by reference, a copy of which is on file in the office of the agency
and the office of the City Clerk, having been duly reviewed and considered, is
hereby incorporated into this ordinance by reference and made a part hereof,
and so as incorporated is hereby designated, approved, and adopted as the
official redevelopment plan for the amended project area.
   Section 7: In order to implement and facilitate the effectuation of the
amendment hereby approved, this City Council hereby:
         (A)   Pledges its cooperation in helping to carry out the amendment;
         (B)   Authorizes and directs the various officials, departments,
boards, and agencies of the city having administrative responsibilities in the
amended project area likewise to cooperate to such end and to exercise their
respective functions and powers in a manner consistent with redevelopment of
the amended project area;
         (C)   Stands ready to consider and take appropriate action upon
proposals and measures designed to effectuate the amendment; and
         (D)   Declares its intention to undertake and complete any proceeding,
including the expenditure of monies, necessary to be carried out by the city
under the provisions of the amendment.
   Section 8: The City Clerk is hereby directed to send a certified copy of
this ordinance to the agency, whereupon the agency is vested with the
responsibility for carrying out the amendment.
   Section 9: The City Clerk is hereby directed to record with the County
Recorder of Merced County a description(s) of the land within the amended
project area and a statement that proceedings for the redevelopment of the
amended project area have been instituted under the CCRL.
   Section 10: The building official of the city is hereby directed for a
period of two years after the effective date of this ordinance to advise all
applicants for building permits within the added territory that the site for
which a building permit is sought for the construction of buildings or for
other improvements is within a redevelopment project area.
   Section 11: The City Clerk is hereby directed to transmit a copy of the
description and statement recorded by the City Clerk pursuant to Section 9 of
this ordinance, a copy of this ordinance, and a map(s) or plat(s) indicating
the boundaries of the amended project area, to the Auditor-Controller and
Assessor of the County of Merced, to the governing body of each of the taxing
agencies which receives taxes from property in the amended project area, and to
the state board of equalization, within 30 days following the adoption of the
amendment.

   The enforcement of this code is vital to the protection of the public’s
health, safety and quality of life. Under Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.4, the city
is authorized to adopt an administrative citation program, which program offers
an alternative method of enforcing code violations. The purpose of issuing
administrative citations pursuant to this chapter is to encourage compliance
with the provisions of this code and to provide a method of holding persons
responsible when they fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of this
code. The use of this chapter is also intended to minimize the expense and
delay associated with pursuing code violations through the civil or criminal
justice system.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION or CITATION. A written notice to a responsible
person that a violation of this code has occurred and an assessment of a civil
fine issued by an enforcement officer.
   CITY MANAGER. The City Manager of the City of Livingston or his or her
designee.
   CONTINUING VIOLATION. Either:
      1.   A particular violation of this code continuing for more than 24
hours without correction or abatement; or
      2.   A repeated, consecutive violation of the same offense without
intervening days.
   ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. Any person authorized to enforce certain provisions of
this code.
   LEGAL INTEREST. Any interest that is represented by a deed of trust,
quitclaim deed, mortgage, judgment lien, tax or assessment lien, mechanic’s
lien or other similar instrument, which is recorded with the County Recorder.
   NOTICE OF VIOLATION. A written notice to a responsible person that a
violation of this code has occurred and a warning that an administrative
citation assessing fines will be issued unless the violation is ceased and
abated.
   RESPONSIBLE PERSON. Any person or persons that an enforcement officer
determines is responsible for causing or maintaining a violation of this code.
The term RESPONSIBLE PERSON includes, but is not limited to, a property owner,
tenant, person with a legal interest in real or personal property, or person in
possession or control of real or personal property.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-3 GENERAL CITATION AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter authorizes use of administrative citations that are in
addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, that the city may
pursue to address any violation of this code.
   (B)   The use of this chapter is at the sole discretion of the City Manager,
City Attorney and the city’s enforcement officers.
   (C)   Any enforcement officer, upon determining that a provision of this
code which such officer is charged to enforce has been violated, has the
authority to issue an administrative citation to any responsible person.
   (D)   Any responsible person violating any provision of this code, or
causing, permitting or maintaining a violation of any provision of this code
may be issued an administrative citation by an enforcement officer.
   (E)   Each and every day a violation of this code exists constitutes a
separate and distinct offense and will be subject to a separate fine. A single
citation may charge a violation for one or more days on which a violation
exists, and for the violation of one or more code sections. Continuing
violations will automatically accrue fines beginning on the date the citation
is issued until verification of abatement pursuant to this chapter.
   (F)   The owner of any property, building or structure within the city has
the responsibility for keeping such property, building or structure free of
violations related to its use or condition. The owner of such property,
building or structure is a responsible person and is separately liable for
violations committed by tenants or occupants relative to the use or condition
of the property.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-4 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Whenever an enforcement officer determines that a violation of this
code exists, the enforcement officer may issue a notice of violation to a
responsible person prior to issuing an administrative citation. The notice of
violation serves as a written warning of responsibility and requires immediate
action by the responsible person to cease and abate the violation. The notice
of violation must include the information set forth in this chapter and a date
by which the violation can reasonably be ceased and abated. If the violation is
not ceased or abated by the end of the correction period stated in the notice,
the enforcement officer may issue an administrative citation.
   (B)   In accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.4, no responsible person
will be assessed an administrative fine under this chapter for a continuing
violation pertaining to a building, plumbing, electrical or similar structural
or zoning issue that does not create an immediate danger to the public health
or safety without first receiving a notice of violation and a reasonable
opportunity to correct or otherwise remedy the violation. In such circumstance,
the stated period available to correct the violation prior to the assessment of
a fine must be appropriate to the violation as determined by the enforcement
officer, but in no event less than five days. If, after the correction period
stated in the notice, the violation is not ceased or abated, the enforcement
officer may issue an administrative citation.
   (C)   Any responsible person receiving notice for a continuing violation may
petition the City Manager for an extension of time to correct the violation so
long as the petition is received before the end of the correction period. The
City Manager may grant an extension of time to correct the violation if the
responsible person has supplied sufficient evidence showing that the correction
cannot reasonably be made within the stated period.
   (D)   The requirement of a reasonable opportunity to cure a violation does
not apply in instances where, in the discretion of the City Manager, a code
violation poses an immediate danger to the public health or safety.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-5 SERVICE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, whenever notice is

following ways:
      1.   Personal service;

effective by regular mail, provided that notice is not returned. Service by
mail will be effective on the date of mailing; or
      3.   Posting the notice conspicuously on or in front of the affected
property or any other real property within the city in which the city has
knowledge that the responsible person has a legal interest.
   (B)   The failure of any interested person to receive any notice served in
accordance with this section will not affect the validity of any proceedings
taken under this chapter.

notice of violation, which may be sent by regular mail or personally served.

§ 1-18-6 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION PROCEDURE.
   Upon determining that a violation of this code exists, an enforcement
officer may issue an administrative citation to any responsible person on a
form authorized by the City Attorney.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-7 ASSESSMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION FINE.
   (A)   The amount of the fine will be assessed according to a schedule of
fines adopted by City Council resolution. The schedule may include escalating
fine amounts for repeat violations occurring within specified periods of time,
and fines may vary depending on the particular code provision violated.
   (B)   Where no amount is specified by resolution of the City Council, the
following fines will apply:
      1.   A fine not exceeding $100 per day for a first violation;
      2.   A fine not exceeding $200 per day for a second violation of the same
code provision or permit within the previous 12 months; or
      3.   A fine not exceeding $500 per day for each additional violation of
the same code provision or permit within the previous 12 months.
   (C)   A penalty of 10% will be added on any delinquent fines on the last day

§ 1-18-8 SATISFACTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a citation, the responsible person must do the
following:
      1.   Pay the fine within 30 days from the date of the administrative
citation. All fines assessed are payable to the city. Payment of a fine does
not excuse or discharge the failure to correct the violation nor will it bar
further enforcement action by the city; and
      2.   Cease and abate the violation. If the offense is a continuing
violation and the responsible person fails to properly cease and abate the
violation, fines will accrue for each day until the abatement is properly
verified. Additionally, subsequent administrative citations may be issued for
the same violation. The amount of the fine for failure to correct the violation
will increase at the rate specified in this chapter or as established by City
Council resolution.
   (B)   At any time following 30 days after the issuance of the citation, the
city may deliver a collection bill to the responsible person requiring payment
for all outstanding amounts owed for the violation, including the amount due
for the initial violation and any accrual of daily fines from the date the
citation was issued to the date the abatement of the offense is properly
verified (if applicable) plus any appropriate late payment charge, less any
amount remitted pursuant to subsection (A) of this section.
   (C)   The abatement of a continuing violation must be verified by an
enforcement officer. The responsible person must contact the phone number
designated on the citation and schedule an inspection by an enforcement
officer. Fines will accrue until the abatement is verified, less any days
delayed by action of the city in scheduling such inspection.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-9 COLLECTION OF UNPAID FINES AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   The failure of any person to pay a fine or penalty assessed by
administrative citation within the time specified on the citation constitutes a
debt to the city. To enforce that debt, the city may file a civil action, lien
the subject property as set forth in Chapter 19 of this title, or pursue any
other legal remedy to collect such debt.
   (B)   A person who fails to pay any fine or other charge owed to the city
under this chapter is liable in any action brought by the city for all costs
incurred in securing payment of the delinquent amount, including, but not
limited to, administrative costs and attorney fees. Such collection costs are
in addition to any fines, interest and late charges.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-10 REQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.
   (A)   Any person receiving an administrative citation may contest the
citation by completing a request for hearing form and returning it to the city
within ten business days after the issuance date of the administration
citation. Any request for hearing must be accompanied by an advance deposit of
the fine assessed by the citation for the initial violation, unless waived by
subsection (C) of this section. If it is determined, after a hearing, that
there was no violation as charged in the administrative citation, the advance
deposit will be refunded.
   (B)   A request for hearing will not postpone or avoid the requirement of a
responsible person to abate a violation nor toll the daily fines accruing for a
continuing violation until the abatement of the offense is properly verified.
In the event the hearing officer upholds the citation, the responsible person
will be liable for the total fines accrued from the issuance of the citation to
the date the abatement is properly verified.
   (C)   A person seeking an administrative hearing may request a hardship
waiver of the fine deposit by filing with the City Manager a completed city
form, which must be signed under penalty of perjury. The request must be
submitted along with the request for hearing. The person requesting the waiver
bears the burden of establishing that such person does not have the financial
ability to make the deposit. The request will be decided by the City Manager
within three business days from date the request is received, and the City
Manager’s decision is final. The applicant will be notified by telephone,
facsimile or in person of the decision on the request. The filing of a request
for hardship waiver does not extend the time to file for an administrative
hearing or pay the fine when due. If the request for hardship waiver is denied,
an administrative hearing will not be scheduled unless the fine deposit is paid
within five business days following the City Manager’s determination on the
request for a hardship waiver.
   (D)   The failure to submit a timely and complete request for hearing will
terminate a person’s right to contest the citation and result in a failure to
exhaust administrative remedies, and the order of the citation will serve as a
final determination and conclusive evidence of the named responsible person’s
liability for the citation.
   (E)   The City Manager shall set a hearing before a city hearing officer on
a date that is not less than 15 and not more than 60 days from the date that
the request for hearing is filed in accordance with the provisions of this
section. The city shall notify the person requesting the hearing by regular
mail of the date, time and place set for the hearing at least ten days prior to
the date of the hearing and give that person any additional written reports
filed concerning the violation that are provided to the hearing officer.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-11 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   A hearing officer, appointed by the City Manager, will conduct the
administrative citation hearing.
   (B)   No hearing to contest an administrative citation before a hearing
officer will be held until a request for hearing form has been completed and
submitted, and the fine has been deposited in advance, unless a hardship waiver
is granted in accordance with §
1-18-10(C) of this chapter.
   (C)   The hearing officer may only consider evidence that is relevant to
whether the violation occurred and whether the responsible person has caused or
maintained the violation of this code on the date specified in the
administrative citation. However, the formal rules of evidence shall not apply
to the hearing.
   (D)   At least ten days prior to the hearing, the city must provide the
recipient of an administrative citation with copies of the citation, reports
and other documents to be submitted to the hearing officer. No other discovery
is permitted. Formal rules of evidence will not apply.
   (E)   The person contesting the administrative citation will be given the
opportunity to testify and present witnesses and evidence concerning the
administrative citation.
   (F)   Unless requested in advance by the person contesting the
administrative citation, neither the code compliance officer nor any other
representative of the city is required to attend the hearing, provided that any
such appearance may be made at the discretion of the enforcement officer or
City Manager.
   (G)   The failure of any recipient of an administrative citation to appear
at the administrative citation hearing will constitute a forfeiture of the fine
and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the order of the citation
will become the final determination.
   (H)   The administrative citation and any additional documents submitted by
the enforcement officer to the hearing officer will constitute prima facie
evidence of the violation and the respective facts contained in those
documents.
   (I)   The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request additional
information from the code compliance officer or the recipient of the
administrative citation prior to issuing a written decision.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006; Ord. 610, passed 2-18-2014)
§ 1-18-12 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING DECISION.
   (A)   After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the
hearing, the hearing officer must issue a written decision within a reasonable
time after the hearing to uphold or deny the administrative citation and must
list in the decision the reasons for that decision. The hearing officer will
use preponderance of evidence as the standard of evidence in deciding issues.
The decision of the hearing officer will be final.
   (B)   If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation
should be upheld, then any applicable fine amount on deposit with the city will
be retained by the city. The hearing officer may also impose conditions and
deadlines to correct the violation or require payment of any outstanding fines,
penalties and interest.
   (C)   If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation
should be canceled or reduced because of an error in calculating the fine, the
city will promptly refund the applicable amount of the deposited fine.
   (D)   The city shall serve the recipient of the administrative citation with
a copy of the hearing officer’s written decision by certified mail.
(Ord. 550, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 1-18-13 RIGHT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   Any person aggrieved by an administrative decision of a hearing officer on

accordance with the time lines and provisions set forth in Cal. Gov’t Code §
53069.4.

(Ord. 460, passed 10-15-1996)
§ 3-12-9 LITTER CLEANUP.
   (A)   Cleanup of premises. Each permit holder shall be required to clean up
all litter outside of the dance premises, including all adjoining public
sidewalks, streets, and alleys and adjoining private property, within seven
hours after each dance held by the permit holder ends, but under no
circumstances later than 8:00 a.m.
   (B)   Dances, litter cleanup, litter cleanup deposit.
      1.   Unless a deposit or statement of liability is made by the owner of
the property and the facility owner has signed a waiver form accepting
responsibility described in subsection (B)2. of this section, each permit
holder shall be required to deposit with the city a litter cleanup deposit as
security for the performance by the permit holder of his or her obligations
under subsection (A) of this section. If the permit holder fails to perform
those obligations, the city can use the security deposit, or any portion of it,
to reimburse the city for the city’s costs in performing those cleanup tasks.
If the permit holder has an annual or quarterly permit, the permit holder
shall, immediately upon demand, pay to the city a sum equal to the portion of
the security deposit expended by the city as provided in this section so as to
maintain the security deposit in the sum initially deposited with the city. For
any other permit holder who is not in default or in violation of any
requirement under this section, the city shall return the security deposit to
such permit holder upon expiration of the permit. The city’s obligations with
respect to the security deposit are those of a debtor and not a trustee. The
city can commingle the security deposit with the city’s general or other funds.
The city shall not be required to pay the permit holder interest on the
security deposit.
      2.   Every owner of a premises who regularly rents or licenses the
premises to others for a fee so that such renters or licensees can hold public
dances therein shall be required to deposit with the city a litter cleanup
deposit or provide the city with a signed statement of liability stating the
facility owner assumes liability as security for the performance by all permit
holders using such premises of their obligations under subsection (A) of this
section. If a statement of liability is used, and the facility owner fails to
meet his or her obligations under subsection (A) of this section, the facility
owner will be billed to reimburse the city for the cost of the cleanup, and the
facility owner will be required to pay the litter cleanup deposit in the
future. This obligation is placed upon the premises’ owner because in most
instances the dance permits issued for such premises are for only one day or
evening.
      3.   The amounts of the security deposits required by this section shall
be fixed and established from time to time by resolution of the City Council.

§ 3-12-10 SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Three day suspension. A dance permit may be suspended for up to three
days by the City Manager, Chief of Police or police lieutenant when any such
city employee finds a violation under subsection (B)2. or (B)3. of this section
or finds that suspension of the dance permit is necessary to immediately
preserve the public peace, safety, health or general welfare.
   (B)   Grounds for suspension or revocation. The City Manager may suspend or
revoke a dance permit on any one or more of the following grounds:
      1.   Negligent or intentional misrepresentation by the permit holder in

to, those set forth in §
3-12-6 of this chapter;
      3.   Violation of any state law or regulation of any city ordinance or
regulation; and
      4.   To preserve the public peace, safety, health or general welfare if
there has been a change in the circumstances since granting the permit.
   (C)   Hearing. Under subsection (B) of this section, if the City Manager
finds a violation under subsection (B)2. or (B)3. of this section, then he or
she may immediately suspend the dance permit. The City Manager shall then hold
a hearing within 15 calendar days of the immediate suspension date to determine
whether the dance permit should be restored, remain suspended or revoked. The
permit holder shall be given at least five days’ prior notice of such a
hearing. During the hearing, the permit holder will be given the opportunity to
present evidence on his or her behalf and to rebut any evidence presented by
the city, and to be represented by an attorney or other representative of his
or her choice. The City Manager’s decision shall be final unless appealed in
writing to the City Council within ten calendar days of the City Manager’s
decision. Unless determined otherwise by the City Manager, the dance permit
shall continue to be suspended pending the appeal to the City Council. The City
Council shall hear the matter within 30 calendar days of the date of receipt of
the appeal of the City Manager’s decision.

(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-14-4 PURPOSE.
   The City Council hereby declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve the
following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be
interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   (A)   To adopt a sales and use tax chapter which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part
1.5 of Division 2;
   (B)   To adopt a sales and use tax chapter which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the State of California
insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and
limitations contained in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.5 of Division 2;
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax chapter which imposes a tax and provides
a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of
Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes; and
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax chapter which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible, consistent with the provisions of
Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.5 of Division 2, minimize the cost of
collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-14-5 CONTRACT WITH STATE.
   Prior to the operative date hereof, the city shall contract with the State
Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration
and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if the city
shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the
operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the
operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following
the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the adoption of this chapter.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-14-6 SALES TAX.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is

(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-14-7 PLACE OF SALE.
   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the
place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer to his or her agent to an out of state destination or
to a common carrier for delivery to an out of state destination. The gross
receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are
subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which
the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)

Division 2, all of the provisions of Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1 of
Division 2 are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully
set forth herein.

§ 3-14-10 LIMITATIONS ON ADOPTION OF STATE LAW.
   In adopting the provisions of Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1 of
Division 2, wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the
taxing agency, the name of this city shall be substituted therefor. The
substitution, however, shall not be made when the word “state” is used as part
of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of
Control, the State Board of Equalization, the state treasury, or the
constitution of the state; the substitution shall not be made when the result
of that substitution would require action to be taken by the city, or any
agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but
not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of
the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an
exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt
from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain
subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Cal. Revenue and Taxation
Code Part 1 of Division 2, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not
be subject to tax by the state under the said provisions of that code; the
substitution shall not be made in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code §§ 6701, 6702
(except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828; and the
substitution shall not be made for the word “state” in the phrase “retailer
engaged in business in this state” in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code § 6203 or
in the definition of that phrase in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code § 6203.

(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-15-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, bachelor hotel, lodging house,
rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome
or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion
thereof.
   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of
any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes.
   OPERATOR. The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity
of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other
capacity. Where the OPERATOR performs his or her functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an OPERATOR for the purposes of this chapter and he or she shall
have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with
the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.
   RENT. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a
period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar
days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be
deemed to be a TRANSIENT until the period of 30 days has expired unless there
is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupancy providing for
a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date hereof may be considered.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-15-3 TAX IMPOSED.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to
and shall pay a tax in the amount of 9% of the rent charged by the operator.
Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s
ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid
by the operator of the hotel, the Director of Finance may require that such tax
shall be paid directly to the Director of Finance.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987; amd. per correspondence dated 11-2-2004)
§ 3-15-4 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   No tax shall be imposed upon:
      1.   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond
the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;
      2.   Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business;
and
      3.   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.
   (B)   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by
the Director of Finance.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-15-5 OPERATOR’S DUTIES.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of rent charged, and
each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No
operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part
will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-15-6 REGISTRATION.
   Within 30 days after the effective date hereof, or within 30 days after
commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting
occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the Director of Finance
and obtain from him or her a “transient occupancy registration certificate” to
be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate
shall, among other things, state the following:
   (A)   The name of the operator;
   (B)   The address of the hotel;
   (C)   The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
   (D)   This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of this chapter
by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from
transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting said tax with the Tax
Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any
unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor
to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws,
including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board
commission, department or office of the city. This certificate does not
constitute a permit.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)
§ 3-15-7 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Director of Finance, make a return to the
Director of Finance, on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies.
At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be
remitted to the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance may establish
shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it
necessary in order to ensure collections of the tax and he or she may require
further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately
upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators
pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city

§ 3-15-9 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director of Finance shall proceed
in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director of
Finance shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain
upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and
payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to
make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and
assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Director of Finance shall

assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest, penalties, if any, determined by the
Director of Finance shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If such application is made, the Director of Finance shall give not
less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.
After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to
be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in §

days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The City
Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk
shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of
address. The findings of the City Council shall be final and conclusive and
shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service
of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of this notice.
(Ord. 343, passed 12-15-1987)

and (C) of this section, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under
penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is
filed with the Director of Finance within three years of the date of payment.
The claim shall be on a form furnished by the Director of Finance.
   (B)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
neither been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable
by the transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city filing a
claim in the manner provided in subsection (A) of this section, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Director of Finance, or when
the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Director of Finance that the transient has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless

§ 3-16-1 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   It is the intent and purpose of the City Council in adopting the ordinance
codified in this chapter to regulate those activities which in the most
technical sense have business or commercial characteristics, but which, because
of the manner in which they are conducted or the purposes for which they are
being operated are truly noncommercial in nature. These regulations are
intended to prevent the expansion of such noncommercial operations into truly
commercial operations and to regulate the method of conducting the activity so
that it will be confined to a noncommercial type of operation. It is the
purpose of this chapter to prevent such activities from unfairly competing with
licensed revenue producing commercial and business enterprises; to prevent the
conduct of commercial enterprises upon other than commercially zoned property;
and to curb the evasion of business license fees.

provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the

requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code.
   (C)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by

itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation
from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and
collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes,

subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

4-4-5 Payment of charge
4-4-6 Municipal facilities fund established
4-4-7 Municipal facilities charges review
§ 4-4-1 PURPOSE.
   The continued construction of new residential and nonresidential structures
with the attendant increase in the population of the city has affected the
quality and quantity of municipal services for the city and the people who
currently live in the city and has created an urgent need for the acquisition,
improvement and expansion of municipal facilities. Many new municipal
facilities and expansion of existing facilities including traffic control and
major roads to serve the increase in population and commercial establishments
will be needed in order to maintain the existing quality and quantity of
municipal services to the city and to preserve the public health, safety and
general welfare. These new residential and nonresidential structures will
receive municipal services provided by existing municipal facilities, yet have
not contributed to the financing of those facilities. It is appropriate that
this new construction help pay their fair share of the cost of existing
municipal facilities necessitated by the new construction. Therefore, the
Council declares that a municipal facilities charge (like the city’s water and
sewer service connection charges and subtrunk sewer extension charges) should
be imposed on certain specified new construction within the city.
(Ord. 338, passed 7-7-1987)
§ 4-4-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

§ 4-5-1-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature has in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred
upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
City Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-1-2 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-1-3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-1-4 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. See definition of SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA
(SFHA).
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the 100-YEAR FLOOD). BASE FLOOD is the term used
throughout this chapter.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade, i.e., below
ground level, on all sides.
   BUILDING. See definition of STRUCTURE.

including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCROACHMENT. The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill,
excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain
which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). The official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOODWATER. A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland
waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from any
source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP. The official map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the
areas of special flood hazards.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable
to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the
flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of
police power which control development in flood prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. See definition of FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOODWATER.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as REGULATORY FLOODWAY as defined herein.
   FLOODWAY ENCROACHMENT LINES. The lines marking the limits of floodways on
federal, state and local floodplain maps.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
   FRAUD and VICTIMIZATION. As related to §
4-5-6 , Variance Procedure, of this chapter, means that the variance granted
must not cause FRAUD on or VICTIMIZATION of the public. In examining this
requirement, the Planning Commission will consider the fact that every newly
constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of
the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition,
future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to
potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, and does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that
is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HARDSHIP. As related to §
4-5-6 , Variance Procedure, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that
would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Planning
Commission requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to
the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      1.   Listed individually on the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register;
      2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      3.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      4.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area
(see definition of BASEMENT) is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR,
provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.
(Note: This definition allows attached garages to be built at grade. Below
grade garages are not allowed as they are considered to be basements.)
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
manufactured home does not include a “recreational vehicle”.

other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine

§ 4-5-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
§ 4-5-3-1 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
city.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-3-2 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the
flood insurance study (FIS) dated August 2, 1995, and accompanying flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs), dated
August 2, 1995, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and
attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may
be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this
chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain
Administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at City Hall, 1416 C
Street, Livingston, CA 95334.

§ 4-5-4 ADMINISTRATION.
§ 4-5-4-1 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in §
4-5-3-2 of this chapter. Application for a development permit shall be made on
forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be
limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location
dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location
of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:
   (A)   Proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all structures;
   (B)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
structure will be floodproofed, if required in §
4-5-5-1(C)3. of this chapter;
   (C)   All appropriate certifications listed in §
4-5-4-3(D) of this chapter; and
   (D)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-4-2 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Engineer or his or her designee is hereby appointed to administer,
implement and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits
in accordance with its provisions.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-4-3 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to, the following.
   (A)   Permit review. Review all development permits to determine that:
      1.   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
      2.   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
      3.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and
      4.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, ADVERSELY
AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
   (B)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood elevation
data has not been provided in accordance with §
4-5-3-2 of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal or state agency, or other source in order to administer §
4-5-5 of this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the City
Council for adoption.
   (C)   Notification of other agencies. In alteration or relocation of a
watercourse:
      1.   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water
Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
      2.   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
      3.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
   (D)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
      1.   Certification required by §
4-5-5-1(C)1. of this chapter (floor elevations);
      2.   Certification required by §
4-5-5-1(C)2. of this chapter (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential
structures);
      3.   Certification required by §
4-5-5-1(C)3. of this chapter (wet floodproofing standard);
      4.   Certification of elevation required by §
4-5-5-3(B) of this chapter (subdivision standards); and
      5.   Certification required by §
4-5-5-4(A) of this chapter (floodway encroachments).
   (E)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
4-5-6 of this chapter.
   (F)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as
specified in §
4-5-3-3 of this chapter.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-4-4 APPEALS.
   The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is

§ 4-5-5 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
§ 4-5-5-1 STANDARDS OF CONSTRUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required.
   (A)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy.
   (B)   Construction materials and methods. All new construction and
substantial improvement shall be constructed:
      1.   With materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
      2.   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
      3.   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
   (C)   Elevation and floodproofing. (See §
4-5-2, Definitions, of this chapter for “new construction”, “substantial
damage” and “substantial improvement”.)
      1.   (a)   Residential construction, new or substantial improvement,
shall have the lowest floor, including basement:
            (1)   In an A zone, elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation; and
            (2)   In all other zones, elevated to the base flood elevation.
         (b)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the
lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      2.   Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated to conform with
§
4-5-5-1(C)1. of this chapter or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities:
         (a)   Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under §
4-5-5-1(C)1. of this chapter so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         (b)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
         (c)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the standards of this subsection (C) are satisfied. Such certification
shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      3.   All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to
flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for
meeting this requirement must exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
         (b)   Be certified to comply with a local floodproofing standard
approved by the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management
Agency; or
         (c)   Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-5-2 STANDARDS FOR UTILITIES.
   (A)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate:
      1.   Infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and
      2.   Discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
   (B)   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them, or contamination from them, during flooding.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-5-3 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard
area and the elevation of the base flood.
   (B)   All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed
structures and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation,
the final first floor and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
   (D)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   (E)   All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-5-4 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
4-5-3-2 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
   (A)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in (the base) flood elevation during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge; and
   (B)   If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with
all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this §
4-5-5.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-6 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
§ 4-5-6-1 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this section is based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants or the property owners.
   (B)   1.   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
(The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only
be met if variances are strictly limited.
      2.   Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more
detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can
be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations
in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.)
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-6-2 APPEAL BOARD.
   (A)   In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter and:
      1.   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
      2.   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      4.   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      5.   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are
not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      10.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
      11.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   (B)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      2.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the Merced County Recorder and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(Ord. 445, passed 8-1-1995)
§ 4-5-6-3 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of §§
4-5-4 and
4-5-5 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” (as defined in §
4-5-2 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   (C)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      1.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional “hardship” (as defined in §
4-5-2 of this chapter) to the applicant; and
      3.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense; create a nuisance (see “public safety and nuisance” as defined
in §
4-5-2 of this chapter), cause “fraud and victimization” (as defined in §
4-5-2 of this chapter) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections (A) through (E) of
this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors of §
4-5-6-2(C) of this chapter and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary
to further the purposes of this chapter.

§ 4-7-1 INTENT.
   (A)   The City Council finds that future development within the County of
Merced to the year 2030 will result in traffic volumes in excess of capacity on
the regional system of arterials, highways, and freeways as designated in this
chapter.
   (B)   The City Council finds that failure to expand the capacity of the
existing circulation system will result in new development causing unacceptable
levels of congestion on the arterials, highways, and freeways of the regional
system.
   (C)   The City Council also finds and declares that, in the absence of this
chapter imposing a fair share traffic fee upon new development, existing and
future sources of revenue are inadequate to fund substantial portions of the
regional transportation system improvements needed to avoid unacceptable levels
of congestion and related adverse impacts caused by new development.
(Ord. 613, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 4-7-2 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds and determines that adoption of this chapter
will raise additional revenues needed to construct improvements to accommodate
traffic that will be generated by new development within the county and city.
   (B)   The City Council also finds and declares that the Regional
Transportation Impact Fee Study (MCAG, January 18, 2008) has determined the
extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes
impacting the roadway system and that this chapter establishes a fair and
equitable method for distributing unfunded costs of transportation improvements
necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by such development.
(Ord. 613, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 4-7-3 SPECIFIC FINDINGS.
   The need for regional transportation improvements and for the regional
transportation impact fee established by this chapter are based on the finding
of the Regional Transportation Impact Fee Study prepared by the Merced County
Association of Governments whose governing board is composed of City Council
members and county supervisors from the county’s six cities and the County
Board of Supervisors. The study has established that growth to the year 2030
will affect the entire regional transportation system and therefore that the
area of impact for future development is appropriately the entire County of
Merced. The study made the following additional findings.
   (A)   Population and employment within the County of Merced is anticipated
to increase by 98% and 82%, respectively by the year 2030 and will result in
levels of service E and F (as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual, 6th
edition) on existing arterials, highways and freeways.
   (B)   The Regional Transportation Plan (MCAG, 2007) modeled and evaluated
the effect of projected growth to the year 2030 on all major arterials,
highways and freeways in Merced County and found that without expansion, the
transportation system would suffer severe congestion. Further, the plan showed
that the recommended transportation improvements would accommodate the traffic
anticipated in the year 2030 at the desired level of service D.
   (C)   Existing and future sources of public revenues are insufficient to
fund all the needed transportation improvements.
   (D)   The revenues generated by this regional transportation impact fee will
provide additional funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements
and will help provide the additional capacity needed in the year 2030 to
accommodate the traffic generated by new development in the cities and County
of Merced.
   (E)   The regional transportation impact fee is a fair and equitable method
of distributing the cost of transportation improvements among the development
that will generate the increased traffic.
(Ord. 613, passed 5-20-2014)

(Ord. 613, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 4-7-6 ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE.
   (A)   The regional transportation impact fee is not intended to be the sole
source of funding for construction of the regional system. Furthermore, the
total amount of fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed the
cost of construction of the regional system;
   (B)   The Merced County Association of Governments has calculated the
regional transportation impact fee according to the following procedure:
      1.   MCAG determined the total costs of the regional transportation
improvements;
      2.   MCAG established a capital improvements program. This will include
each regional transportation improvement project with its total project cost,
and sources of funds to pay for the project, specifically showing the amount
for each project to be funded through the regional transportation impact fee;
      3.   MCAG determined the total amount to be funded by the fee by summing
the fee shares of each project in the capital improvements program;
      4.   MCAG determined the total number of peak hour trips associated with
new development, for each land use category listed in §
4-7-4 of this chapter, by using the MCAG traffic model and subtracting the
number of peak hour trips generated in Merced County by each category in the
year 2005 from the number of such trips generated by the same category in the
year 2030;
      5.   MCAG determined a per trip cost by dividing the total amount to be
funded by the fee by the total number of trips associated with new development;
      6.   MCAG determined a cost per unit of development for the land use
categories listed in §
4-7-4 of this chapter. This cost will be calculated by multiplying the per trip
cost by the average peak hour trips per unit of development. Units of
development will be dwelling units for residential land uses, and 1,000 square
feet of floor area for commercial, industrial, and other land uses; and
      7.   The fee for each new development is calculated by multiplying the
cost per unit of development by the number of units being developed.
   (C)   As shown in the Regional Transportation Impact Fee Study, MCAG has
determined that the cost per peak hour trip is $3,115;
   (D)   The regional transportation impact fee study has calculated the
following transportation impact fee schedule for these land use categories:
Residential, single-family            $3,115 per dwelling unit
Residential, multi-family             $1,892 per dwelling unit
Retail commercial, general            $4,146 per 1,000 square foot floor area
Retail commercial, high turnover      $12,082 per 1,000 square foot floor area
Retail commercial, low turnover       $2,780 per 1,000 square foot floor area
Retail commercial, over 50,000 square $7,161 per 1,000 square foot floor area
feet
Office commercial                     $3,337 per 1,000 square foot floor area
Industrial/ag processing              $1,409 per 1,000 square foot floor area
 
   (E)   Should the applicant believe the land use category in subsection (D)
of this section is not appropriate for their application, the applicant may
propose a more appropriate development category, subject to the approval of the
City Manager or their designee, and alternative trip generation rate from the
ITE trip generation code noted in this chapter for use in calculation of the
appropriate trip generation rate; or
   (F)   Should the applicant believe the land use category in subsection (D)
of this section is not appropriate for their application, the applicant may
have prepared, at their own expense, a trip generation study conducted by a
licensed traffic engineer that forecasts the anticipated peak hour trips for
the proposed development. The study procedure and results shall require the
approval of the City Manager or his or her designee.

District is to encourage a desired level of preplanning for the development or
redevelopment of land and to establish innovative design solutions while
retaining good land use relationships and compatibility with adjoining
property. This district’s function is to facilitate the variation of standards
of the zoning ordinance under proper planning and to achieve, where
appropriate, unique and imaginative community design whenever it can be
demonstrated that such variation will result in an environment superior to that
possible under the normal application of city standards.
   (C)   Application process. A planned development (PD) permit may be
requested for any proposed project and may be established in any area suitable
for and of sufficient size (one acre minimum) to contain a planned development,
and may include residential, commercial or industrial uses where appropriate
findings can be made. A PD permit application shall be filed and considered
concurrently with the zoning request and project plan application (§
5-6-11-1  of this title) for a PD Overlay District. The Planning Commission
shall provide a recommendation on the PD permit and PD Overlay District to the
City Council, who shall take action on the proposal. Public hearings shall be
held pursuant to §
5-6-6  of this title. After the establishment of a PD Overlay District, an
application for a development plan (§
5-6-11-2  of this title), which is in conformance with the approved project
plan, shall be filed with the Planning Department and the applicable filing fee
or processing deposit paid.

highway commercial or limited industrial along the SR 99 corridor, west of
Sultana Drive and east of Dwight Way. Uses will be regulated to provide for
vehicle sales lots with limited provisions for service.
   (C)   Permitted uses. Establishment of a VEH Overlay District shall be for
the sole purpose of designating a future auto mall. Any vehicle sales activity
will require a use permit and is subject to a site plan/design review under the
provisions of this title.

§ 5-3-15 LAND USE REGULATIONS (ZONING MATRIX).
   (A)   Range of uses. Uses within the city shall be consistent with the land
use/zoning matrix contained in the tables of this section.
      1.   Permitted uses:. Permitted uses are indicated on the land use/zoning
matrix by the letter “P” in the box defined by a use and zone designation.
These uses are allowed in the districts indicated without discretionary review,
subject to determination of compliance with the development, parking,
landscaping and other standards of the zoning ordinance by the city.
      2.   Conditional uses. Conditional uses are indicated on the land use/
zoning matrix by the letter “C” in the box defined by a use and zone
designation. Conditional uses may be permitted subject to obtaining a use
permit from the Planning Commission or Planning Director, as regulated
elsewhere in this title. For commercial cannabis uses, the letter “C” in the
box defined by a use and zone designation indicates the requirement of a
cannabis permit, as required under §
5-5-14 of this title.
      3.   Accessory uses. Accessory uses are secondary to a primary or
principal use on a site. Accessory uses are permitted in all zoning districts.
      4.   Prohibited uses. A blank space in a box on the land use/zoning
matrix indicates that the use is prohibited. Any private drilling operations
including, but not limited to, oil, water, mineral and metal are prohibited.
Also, any cannabis or medical cannabis dispensary is prohibited, as well as any
other commercial cannabis activity, except as specifically established in this
title.
   (B)   Uses not listed. The land use/zoning matrix is not intended to be a
comprehensive list of all possible uses, but rather identifies the more common
uses likely to be proposed in the city. Uses not specifically covered by any
use category, but which appear to be similar in nature to permitted or
conditional uses, shall be reviewed by the Planning Director, who shall
determine the use classification based upon activity characteristics of the
proposed use. The Planning Director may also consult with the Planning
Commission in determining if a proposed use is a permitted activity. A proposed
use shall otherwise be considered a prohibited use where it is not provided for
within a district.

§ 5-3-16 LOT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   All buildings or structures or portions of structures developed or
modified under the terms of this title shall comply with the development
standards of Tables 6, Development Standards, 7, Lot Configurations, and 8,
Building Structure Setback Requirements, of this section.
   (B)   Street frontage/lot width in the case of a lot fronting on a curving
street or around a curving portion of a cul-de-sac street shall be the distance
between the side lot lines measured along the chord at the front setback line.
   (C)   Some developments within the city contain standards regulating issues
such as building/structure height, yard setbacks, floor area ratio and fencing,
which may be less or more restrictive than the development standards contained
within this section. Such individualized standards, typically prescribed by
conditions of approval of the underlying subdivisions or planned developments,
shall prevail over the standards contained within this section, except where,
as determined by the Planning Director, application of standards unique to a
particular development would be inconsistent with the general plan. In such
cases, the Planning Director shall consult with the Planning Commission in
determining if current standards from this title should be applied.

parking spaces required in all commercial districts may be satisfied in whole
or in part by obtaining approval from the City Council under the following
conditions.

plus annual interest. Payments to the city shall be made per a city approved
payment plan.
      3.   The maximum payment period shall be five years. The first minimum
payment shall be made prior to the issuance of a building permit. Each
additional payment shall be due on each anniversary date of the building permit
until the total sum due the city is paid in full.
         (a)   Said funds shall be deposited with the city in a special fund
and shall be used and expended exclusively for the purpose of acquiring and

general vicinity of the buildings for which in lieu payments were made.
         (b)   Should any owner fail or refuse to pay to the city the amount of
any annual payment due under subsection (E)2. of this section, the amount due
and payable shall constitute a special assessment against said real property
and shall be a lien against said real property, and the amount of such special
assessment shall be added to the next regular bill for taxes levied against
said real property for municipal purposes. The amount of the special assessment

occupancy permit, building permit, use permit, variance or rezoning, and to
require orderly development and improvement of property consistent with public
health and safety for the good of the general public.
   (C)   When improvements are required.
      1.   Except as provided in subsection (E) of this section, no occupancy
permit, building permit, use permit, variance or rezoning shall be issued or

for the construction of curb, gutter, sidewalk, surface drainage improvements
or any other public improvements required for the property by any other

   (D)   Street development agreement. If the Planning Department determines
that the applicant does not have to construct the required street improvements
on or about the time the permit, variance or rezoning is issued or approved,
then the applicant shall sign a recordable street improvement agreement which
will provide that the applicant agrees to construct the improvements when
required by the city and that if applicant fails to construct the improvements
when required the city shall have the right to have those improvements
constructed at applicant’s expense and to have those costs become a lien upon
applicant’s property, added to the next tax bill, and collected in the same
manner as real property taxes on the property are collected.
   (E)   Exceptions.

   (A)   Intent. The purpose of this section is for the preservation and
protection of mature trees on private property.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this section are applicable in all
zoning districts of the city. Any planting, replacement and/or maintenance of

plantings at the discretion of the city. The city requires a five to one (5:1)
replacement ratio for removal of any protected tree. Each replacement tree
shall be a minimum 24 inch box size, though the city may, as part of the tree
permit process or as part of any required site plan/design review, require
installation of larger trees. When trees larger than 24 inch box size are
installed, the tree replacement ratio of five to one (5:1) may be reduced at
the discretion of the city.
   (E)   Prohibited trees. Any tree that may create unsafe conditions by
excessive dropping of leaves, bark, fruit or seeds shall not be allowed as a
replacement tree. Compliance with §
9-2-7 of this code shall also apply. Unlawful trees include: sycamore, poplar,
willow, American elm, walnut, fruitless mulberry, eucalyptus, conifers, pepper,
palm acacia and Modesto ash. Fruiting trees are prohibited in city easements.

§ 5-4-9 OUTDOOR DINING AREAS.
§ 5-4-9-1 OUTDOOR DINING AREAS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, PERMANENT AND ACCESSORY.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      1.   While it is the intent of this title to require that businesses be
conducted completely within an enclosed building, the city recognizes the need
to allow certain outdoor facilities which help achieve the goals of the city’s
general plan. Outdoor dining areas, when accompanying indoor restaurants, are
just such facilities; they enhance the village/pedestrian atmosphere of an
area. In recognition of this, it is the purpose of this section to provide for
outdoor dining facilities on private property which add to the pedestrian
ambiance, while mitigating potential visual impacts, parking impacts, traffic
congestion, accessibility and noise impacts. This section also aims to
integrate such activities into the appropriate zones with the least impact to
the surrounding community.
      2.   This section applies to outdoor dining facilities on private
property. For provisions for outdoor dining facilities on public property,
please refer to §
5-4-9-2, Outdoor Dining Areas On Public Property, Permanent And Accessory, of
this chapter.
   (B)   Applicability. This section shall apply only to outdoor dining
facilities on private property which have not been approved by the city as of
November 21, 2006.
   (C)   Review requirements. Outdoor dining areas for all new structures shall
be reviewed as part of the site plan/design review process prior to
construction and only require a conditional use permit for amplified live
entertainment and the service of beer, wine and hard alcohol outdoors. All
outdoor dining facilities for existing structures on private property shall
require an outdoor dining permit, reviewed by the following authorities through
the indicated administrative or discretionary action:

5-4-9-2 , Outdoor Dining Areas on Public Property, Permanent and Accessory, of
this chapter.
      4.   Height. No outdoor dining area shall exceed the height limit of the
zone, except that tables, chairs, and umbrellas and any safety related
guardrails located on rooftop decks may exceed the height limits of the zone so
long as the permanent structures on which they are located comply with the
height limits of the zone.
      5.   Location. Outdoor dining areas are allowed only when all of the
following criteria apply:

complying with the definition of restaurants as found in §
5-7-2, Definitions of Words and Phrases, of this title; and
         (b)   The restaurant is permitted or conditionally permitted in the
zone in which it is located, as listed in the land use/zoning matrix, §
5-3-15, Table 3 of this title.

can be made in addition to the required findings:
            (1)   Public parking is available in close proximity to the
restaurant; and
            (2)   Given the specific conditions of the site and the adjacent
area, the waiver or modification of requirements will not result in inadequate
parking.
      7.   Property owner agreement. The property owner shall provide written
consent for the outdoor dining facilities.
      8.   Sight distance problems. Outdoor dining areas shall not create any
sight distance problems to or from the appropriate streets, parking areas and

      9.   Conditions. Conditions may be added to the project including, but
not limited to, hours of operation, the removal and storage of furniture at
night, decorative fencing, additional landscaping and restrictions on lighting.
   (E)   Required findings. Prior to the approval of an outdoor dining permit
and/or conditional use permit, the following findings shall be made:
      1.   The outdoor dining area contributes to the village/pedestrian
ambiance of the city, in accordance with the city’s general plan;
      2.   The outdoor dining area complies with the standards of this section;
      3.   Any negative visual, noise, traffic, accessibility and parking
impacts associated with the outdoor dining area have been reduced to an
acceptable level, as determined by the city; and
      4.   The outdoor dining facility is compatible with the existing building
to which the facility is attached.
   (F)   Approvals valid for one year. The outdoor dining permit and/or
conditional use permit shall be valid for one year, at which point the
applicant may request, in writing, a permanent permit. No permit/application
fee shall be required for this request. The Planning Director shall renew the
permits, without benefit of a public hearing, if the original findings for the
permit apply. If the original findings for the permit cannot be made, the
outdoor dining permit and/or conditional use permit must be reviewed by the
Planning Commission, for the purpose of modification or revocation of the
permit.

to allow certain outdoor facilities on public property which help achieve the
goals of the city’s general plan. Outdoor dining areas, when accompanying

this section to provide for outdoor dining facilities on public property which
add to the pedestrian ambiance, while mitigating potential visual impacts,
parking impacts, traffic congestion, accessibility, noise impacts, impacts on
pedestrian movement, or public safety impacts. This section also aims to
integrate such activities into the appropriate zones with the least impact to
the surrounding community.
      2.   This section applies to outdoor dining facilities on public
property. For provisions for outdoor dining facilities on private property,
please refer to §
5-4-9-1, Outdoor Dining Areas on Private Property, Permanent and Accessory, of

   (D)   Minimum standards. The following restrictions shall apply to outdoor
dining areas on public property in nonresidential and mixed use zones, where
allowed.
      1.   Accessibility, vertical. Umbrellas and similar objects related to
the facilities must be located so that they do not endanger the safety of
pedestrians or block access to businesses or to the sidewalk or street. A
minimum seven-foot clearance, as measured from the ground below an umbrella or
similar object to the lowest portion of the umbrella shade or ribs, is
recommended as a guideline, with the actual clearance to be determined through
the encroachment permit review process and subject to Title 24 of the Cal. Code
of Regulations disabled access requirements and ADA (Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.) standards.
      2.   Indemnification. The permittee shall execute an agreement in a form
acceptable to the City Attorney which defends, indemnifies and holds the city
and its employees harmless from and against any loss or damage arising from the
use or existence of the improvements or encroachment authorized under the
encroachment permit.
      3.   Insurance. The permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force
comprehensive general liability, broad form property damage and blanket
contractual liability insurance in a combined single limit amount, per claim
and aggregate, of at least $1,000,000 covering the permittee’s operations on
the sidewalk. Such insurance shall name, on a special endorsement form, the
city, its elected and appointed boards, officers, agents and employees as
additional insureds. The policy of insurance or special endorsement form shall
state that the insurance is provided on an occurrence basis and is primary to
the city’s insurance. A certificate of insurance shall contain provisions that
prohibit cancellations, modifications or lapse without 30 days’ prior written
notice to the city.
      4.   Maintenance. The public right-of-way will be maintained at a level
acceptable to the city.
      5.   Other standards. Outdoor dining facilities on public property shall
comply with the standards for outdoor dining facilities for private property,

property associated with the outdoor dining facility at the city’s request to
allow the city to perform maintenance, repair, replacement and installation of
new public facilities and private utilities.
      7.   Setback from alley, driveway or street. When an outdoor dining area
is located directly adjacent to an alley, driveway or street, a five-foot
setback shall be maintained from the alley, driveway or street. This setback
may be reduced to zero feet by the approving authority in circumstances where
the public safety may be maintained to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
For setbacks at street corners, please refer to the following subsection (D)8.
      8.   Setback, street corner. At street intersections, the triangular area
formed by measuring 25 feet along the property line of each frontage from the
intersection of the property lines at the corner shall remain free of outdoor
dining facilities on public property. This setback may be reduced to ten feet
by the approving authority in circumstances where the public safety may be
maintained to the satisfaction of the city, particularly the City Engineer.
      9.   Sidewalk width. A minimum public sidewalk width of five feet shall
be maintained. (Umbrellas and similar objects which comply with subsection
(D)1. of this section may protrude into this minimum sidewalk width.) The
minimum sidewalk width may be reduced to four feet by the approving authority
in circumstances where the public safety may be maintained to the satisfaction
of the City Engineer.

fee shall be required for this request. The Director of Public Works shall
renew the permits, without benefit of a public hearing, if the original
findings for the permit apply. If the original findings for the permit cannot
be made, the encroachment permit and/or conditional use permit must be reviewed
by the Planning Commission, for the purpose of modification or revocation of
the permit.

low income, or affordable households in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code §§
65915 and 65917. It is the intent of the city to facilitate the development of
low and moderate income housing, including senior housing and special needs
populations, and to implement the goals and policies of the city’s housing
element.
   (B)   Eligibility. In order to be eligible for a density bonus and other
incentives as provided by this section, a proposed residential development
shall consist of five or more dwelling units and can be designed and
constructed so that at least:
      1.   Ten percent of the total units of a housing development are for low
income households;
      2.   Five percent of the total units of a housing development are for
very low income households;
      3.   The total number of dwelling units of a housing development are for
qualifying residents, such as a senior citizen housing development; or
      4.   Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a condominium project for
persons and families of moderate income.
   (C)   Qualifying project. A qualifying project shall be allowed a minimum
20% increase, with a maximum 35% increase, in the maximum number of dwelling
units allowed by the zoning district and general plan land use designation
applicable to the lot(s) as of the date of the permit application. A single
development project shall not be granted more than three density bonuses.
   (D)   Land donation. A developer may donate land for very low income housing
that is sufficient to provide at least 10%, and up to 35%, of the units in the
development for very low income households. For a 10% land donation, a
developer receives a 15% density bonus above the maximum allowable density for
the entire development. The donated land shall be at least one acre in size or
of sufficient size to permit development of at least 40 units, has the
appropriate general plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development as
affordable housing, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and
infrastructure. The land shall have appropriate zoning and development
standards to make the development of the affordable units feasible.
   (E)   Agreement.
      1.   Pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(b), if a developer seeks and
agrees to construct at least 10% of the total units for lower income
households, at least 5% of the total units for very low income households, a
senior citizen housing development or at least 10% of the total units in a
condominium project for persons and families of moderate income, the developer
is entitled to one density bonus and at least one additional concession or
incentive.
      2.   The developer shall receive two incentives or concessions for
projects that include at least 20% of the total units for lower income
households, at least 10% for very low income households, or at least 20% for

persons and families of moderate income in a condominium or planned
development.
      4.   The City Council shall approve one or more of these incentives,
listed below, unless it makes a written finding that the additional concession
or incentive is not required in order for the sales price or rent for the
targeted dwelling units to be set in compliance with state law (Cal Gov’t Code
§ 65915(c)):
         (a)   A reduction in the site development and/or design standards of
this title (e.g., reduction in setback or parking requirements, or an increase
in building coverage requirements);
         (b)   Approval of mixed use development in conjunction with the
housing project if the nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the
housing project, and the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the
housing project and surrounding development; and
         (c)   Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the
developer or the city that will result in identifiable cost reductions.
   (F)   Location of units. The location of density bonus units within the
qualifying project may be at the discretion of the developer. However, the
inclusionary units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the development
(where feasible), shall contain on average the same number of bedrooms as the
noninclusionary units in the development, and shall be compatible with the
design or use of the remaining units in terms of appearance, materials and
quality finish.
   (G)   Project management plan. Prior to issuance of any building permit for
the project, a project management plan, in the form of a written contract,
shall be executed by and between the applicant/developer, housing agency and
city. The contract shall be a recorded document approved by the City Council as
to form and content, and shall set forth sales, resales and rental restrictions
to ensure that designated units remain available as low and moderate income,
senior housing or special needs units, as applicable, for the term of the
project under Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(c).
   (H)   Provisions. The management plan shall provide for the housing agency
to ensure the financial or circumstantial eligibility of applicants for
purchase/rental of the low and moderate income or special needs and senior
housing for the term of the project. If requested by the housing agency, the
management plan shall provide for reimbursement by the applicant/developer the
costs to the housing agency of administering the management plan.
   (I)   Requests for approval.
      1.   All requests for density bonuses and other incentives outlined in
this section shall be approved by the City Council. Findings shall be
consistent with applicable provisions of current state law at the time of
permit application.
      2.   Any application for the density bonus shall be in the form and
method prescribed by the Planning Director and accompanied by plot and
development plans necessary to determine compliance with the purpose, intent
and development standards prescribed herein. The development plans shall
contain sufficient cost and market data based upon the land cost per dwelling
unit to assure any density bonus concessions granted are necessary to attain
the affordability targets mandated by Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915 and Senate Bill
1818.

collocation2
Notes:
1.   If roof or wall mounted antenna extends above the roofline, parapet wall
or similar roof screen, a conditional use permit is required to authorize the
antenna
2.   A conditional use permit is required if the collocation increases the
height of the existing tower/structure.
 
      2.   Conditions. The designated approving authority for each of the
listed permits may impose conditions on the wireless communication facility
applications to ensure compliance with all provisions and purposes of this
chapter.
      3.   Findings. Findings to deny any permit for a wireless communication
facility as regulated herein shall be done in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in the written record. Denial shall not be based
on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions that comply with the
Federal Communication Commission emission regulation.
   (F)   Exemptions. The following wireless communication facilities are exempt
from the requirements of this chapter as specified below and are subject to
compliance with other provisions of this title.
      1.   A wireless communication facility shall be exempt from the
provisions of this section if and to the extent that a permit issued by the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) or the rules and regulations of
the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) specifically provides that the
antenna is exempt from local regulation.
      2.   Satellite earth station (SES) antennas, which are two meters (2 m)
(6.5616 feet) or less in diameter or in diagonal measurement, located in any
nonresidential zoning district. In order to avoid the creation of an attractive
nuisance, reduce accidental tripping hazards and maximize stability of the
structure, such antennas shall be placed whenever possible on top of buildings
and as far away as possible from the edges of rooftops.
      3.   Parabolic antennas, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) antennas and
multipoint distribution service (MDS) antennas, which are one meter (3.2808
feet) or less in diameter or diagonal measurement and television broadcast
service (TVBS) antennas, so long as said antennas are located entirely on
private property and are not located within the required front yard setback
area. This locational requirement is necessary to ensure that such antenna
installations do not become attractive nuisances and/or result in accidental
tripping hazards if located adjacent to a street or other public right-of-way.
      4.   Amateur radio antenna structures provide a valuable and essential
telecommunication service during periods of natural disasters and other
emergency conditions and are therefore exempt from permit provisions of this
chapter in compliance with the following standards.
         (a)   Height limits. Amateur radio antennas in any district may extend
to a maximum height of 75 feet, provided that the tower is equipped with a
lowering device (motorized and/or mechanical) capable of lowering the antenna
to the maximum permitted height when not in operation.
         (b)   Location parameters. All antenna structures shall be located
outside of required front and street side yard areas. Antenna structures shall
also be setback a minimum distance of five feet from interior property lines.
If any portion of the antenna overhangs any property line, a design review
permit is required to obtain the authorized signature of all affected property
owners on the required application form.
         (c)   Tower safety. All antennas shall be located within an enclosed
fenced area or have a minimum six-foot high tower shield at the tower base to
prevent climbing. All active elements of antennas shall have a minimum vertical
clearance of eight feet.
      5.   Minor modifications (emergency or routine) provided there is little
or no change in the visual appearance as determined by the PIP director.
   (G)   Development standards; general development standards. Unless otherwise
exempt pursuant to subsection (F) of this section, the following general
development standards shall apply to all wireless communication facilities.
      1.   All wireless communication facilities shall comply with all
applicable requirements of the current uniform codes as adopted by the city and
shall be consistent with the general plan, this title, as well as other
standards and guidelines adopted by the city.
      2.   All design review and conditional use permit applications for
wireless communication facilities shall include a description of services
proposed and documentation certifying applicable licenses or other approvals
required by the Federal Communications Commission to provide services proposed
in connection with the application.
      3.   All design review and conditional use permit applications for
wireless communications facilities shall include a map and narrative
description of all telecommunication sites existing, proposed or planned by the
applicant in the city and within a one mile radius of the city border. Such
applications shall also include an analysis of all reasonable and technically
feasible alternative locations and/or facilities (including collocations) which
could provide the proposed communication service.
      4.   To minimize the overall visual impact, new wireless communication
facilities shall be collocated with existing facilities, with other planned new
facilities, and with other facilities such as water tanks, light standards and
other utility structures whenever feasible and aesthetically desirable. To
facilitate collocation when deemed appropriate, conditions of approval for
conditional use permits shall require all service providers to cooperate in the
siting of equipment and antennas to accommodate the maximum number of operators
at a given site when found to be feasible and aesthetically desirable. The
applicant shall agree to allow future collocation of additional antennas and
shall not enter into an exclusive lease for the use of the site.
      5.   At least ten feet of horizontal clearance shall be maintained
between any part of the antenna and any power lines unless the antenna is
installed to be an integral part of a utility tower or facility.
   (H)   Development standards for antennas (excluding radio antennas). Unless
otherwise exempt pursuant to subsection (F) of this section, the following
development standards shall apply to receive-only antennas (ground and building
mounted), parabolic antennas and satellite earth stations as defined in
subsection (D) of this section.
      1.   Maximum number. One antenna per parcel, unless the applicant can
demonstrate the service need for additional antenna.
      2.   Antenna location. Parabolic antenna and satellite earth stations
shall be ground mounted in residential zoning districts. In all nonresidential
zoning districts, the preference is for building mounted antenna. No antenna
shall be located in the required front or street side yard of any parcel unless
entirely screened from pedestrian view of the abutting street rights-of-way
(excluding alleys). In all zoning districts, ground mounted antennas shall be
situated as close to the ground as possible to reduce visual impact without
compromising their function and all portions of the structure/antenna shall be
set back a minimum of five feet from any property line.
      3.   Height limit. The height limit for ground mounted antenna is six
feet. However, the height may be increased to a maximum of 12 feet if the
setback distance from all property lines is at least equal to the height of the
antenna and if the structure is screened in accordance with subsection (H)4. of
this section. Building mounted antennas shall not extend above the roofline,
parapet wall or other roof screen or project beyond a maximum of 18 inches from
the face of the building or other support structure.
      4.   Screening. Ground mounted antenna shall be screened with a fence,
wall or dense landscaping so that the antenna is not visible from the public
right-of-way and to minimize the visual impact on abutting properties. Building
mounted antennas shall be screened as follows.
         (a)   Wall mounted equipment shall be flush mounted and painted or
finished to match to building with concealed cables.
         (b)   Roof mounted equipment shall be screened from view of public
rights-of-way by locating the antenna below the roofline, parapet wall, or
other roof screen and by locating the antenna as far away as physically
feasible and aesthetically desirable from the edge of the building.
      5.   Color. Antennas shall have subdued colors and nonreflective
materials which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area or
building.
   (I)   Development standards for amateur radio antennas. Amateur radio
antennas may exceed the height limit and/or amend the setback provisions of the
exempt amateur radio antenna structures (subsection (F) “Exemptions” of this
section) only when said regulation will result in unreasonable limitations on,
or prevent, reception or transmission of signals. The designated approving
authority may issue the design review permit subject to any conditions
necessary or appropriate to minimize the safety or aesthetic impacts of antenna
installations, provided the conditions do not unreasonably prevent or limit
transmission or reception of signals.
   (J)   Development standards for towers. The following development standards
shall apply to towers (including collocation facilities) as defined in
subsection (D), Definitions, of this section.
      1.   Site design. All facilities (including related equipment) shall be
designed to minimize the visual impact to the greatest extent feasible,
considering technological requirements, by means of placement, screening,
camouflage, to be compatible with existing architectural elements, landscape
elements and other site characteristics. The applicant shall use the smallest
and least visible antennas possible to accomplish the owner/operator’s coverage
objective. A visual impact analysis is required to demonstrate how the proposed
facility will appear from public rights-of-way (including public trails).
      2.   Safety design. All facilities shall be designed so as to be
resistant to and minimize opportunities for unauthorized access, climbing,
vandalism, graffiti, and other conditions which would result in hazardous
conditions, visual blight or attractive nuisances.
      3.   Location. Towers shall not be located in any required front or
street side yard in any zoning district. The setback distance from any abutting
street right-of-way, residential property line or public trail shall be equal
to the height of the facility (tower and related equipment). Otherwise, the
minimum setback distance from all other property lines shall be at least equal
to 20% of the height of the tower.
      4.   Height limit. The height limit for towers shall be consistent with
the maximum building height of the zoning district of the subject parcel.
Exceptions to the height limit may be granted when the designated approving
authority finds that reasonable alternatives do not exist to provide the
necessary service. There is no height limit specified for collocations on
existing structures, provided facilities are screened from view of abutting
street rights-of-way or camouflaged by matching the color(s) and/or material(s)
of the structure to which it is attached.
      5.   Lighting. Towers and related equipment shall be unlit except as
provided below:
         (a)   A manually operated or motion detector controlled light above
the equipment shed door may be provided, except that the light shall remain off
except when personnel are present at night;
         (b)   The minimum tower lighting required under FAA regulation; and
         (c)   Where tower lighting is required, said lighting shall be
shielded or directed downward to the greatest extent possible to ensure that
such light does not spill over onto abutting properties, especially residential
zoning districts or uses.
      6.   Landscape. Where appropriate, facilities shall be installed so as to
maintain and enhance existing landscaping on the site, including trees, foliage
and shrubs, whether or not utilized for screening. Additional landscaping shall
be planted around the tower and related equipment and along street frontages to
buffer abutting residential zoning districts or uses, and to buffer public
trails in accordance with the following standards.
         (a)   Perimeter of facility. Landscaping around the perimeter of the
facility shall include dense tree and shrub plantings with necessary
irrigation. Wireless communication facilities shall be developed with an
immediate landscape screen. Trees shall be fast growing evergreen species, a
minimum of 24-inch box in size. Shrubs shall be a minimum 15 gallon size
covering a minimum planter area depth of five feet around the facility. Trees
and shrubs shall be planted no farther apart on center than the mature diameter
of the proposed species.
         (b)   Street frontage. Along all street frontages abutting the subject
parcel, trees shall be fast growing evergreen species, a minimum of 24-inch box
in size, planted no farther apart on center than the mature diameter of the
proposed species.
         (c)   Buffer to residential zoning districts or uses and public
trails. Along the entire length of all residential property lines and public
trails abutting the subject parcel, 24-inch box, fast growing evergreen trees
shall be planted no farther apart on center than the mature diameter of the
proposed species. Additionally, shrub planting along public trails shall be a
minimum five gallon size and species shall be consistent with the native or
other plantings along the trail in that same area.
      7.   Design/finish. The tower and related equipment shall have subdued
colors and nonreflective materials that blend with the colors and materials of
surrounding areas. When located on a parcel abutting a designated scenic
corridor in the city, the tower shall be designed to simulate a tree of similar
species to other trees in the immediate area.
      8.   Advertising. The tower and related equipment shall not bear any
signs or advertising devices other than certification, warning or other
required seals or signs.
      9.   Parking. The off-street parking for wireless communication
facilities shall be determined by the designated approving authority in
conjunction with required development permits.
   (K)   Operation and maintenance standards.
      1.   Noise. All wireless communication facilities shall comply with the
city’s noise ordinance at all times. When facilities are located within 100

application. Any fee required for processing the application shall not be
returned or refunded to the applicant.
   (G)   Submittal with other applications. The city may require that a
development agreement application be filed concurrently with other development
related applications to ensure that adequate information is available to allow
for the thorough review of the project’s benefits and impacts.
   (H)   Public hearing; transmittal to Commission. The Planning Director shall
transmit the application and the draft agreement to the Planning Commission for
a public hearing when all of the necessary reports and recommendations are
complete. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
development application as prescribed in the California Government Code.
   (I)   Public hearing by City Council.
      1.   After the Planning Commission has held a public hearing, it shall
render its decision in the form of a written report, and a recommendation shall
include proposed findings on the matters stated in this chapter.
      2.   Prior to the public hearing, the applicant shall submit a letter to
the city indicating agreement with the provisions of the proposed development
agreement. If the applicant does not concur with all provisions, the letter
shall specify the areas of disagreement and indicate the reasons for such
disagreement.
      3.   Upon receipt of the recommendation and report of the Planning
Commission, the City Council shall hold a required public hearing.
      4.   After the Council has held a public hearing, it may approve, modify
and approve, or disapprove the development agreement. It may, but need not,
refer to matters not previously considered by the Planning Commission for a
report and recommendation. The Planning Commission may, but need not, hold a
public hearing on matters referred to it by the City Council.
   (J)   Action by City Council.
      1.   In order to approve a development agreement, the City Council shall
adopt findings of fact, including, but not limited to, the following:
         (a)   That the development agreement is consistent with the goals,
objectives and policies of the general plan, and any applicable specific plan
or policy plan;
         (b)   That the development agreement is compatible with the uses
authorized in, and the regulations prescribed for, the land use district in
which the real property is or will be located;
         (c)   That the development agreement would not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare of the community;
         (d)   That the development agreement would promote the public
convenience, general welfare, and good land use practices, and is in the best
interest of the community;
         (e)   That the development agreement would not adversely affect the
orderly development of property or the preservation of property values; and
         (f)   That the development agreement would promote and encourage the

certainty;
      2.   A development agreement shall be adopted by ordinance.
   (K)   Execution of development agreement. The applicant shall execute the
development agreement within 15 calendar days after adoption of the ordinance.
Failure to execute the agreement shall result in the agreement becoming null
and void.
   (L)   Amendment of development agreement. An amendment to a development
agreement shall be subject to the same public notice and hearing process as
adoption of the agreement. When adopting an amendment, the City Council shall
make findings, including, but not limited to, that the amendment is consistent
with the provisions of the agreement, with the original intent of the
development agreement and that the amendment will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or general welfare of the community. Any revision to the
development agreement which does not relate to the term of the agreement,
permitted uses of the property, provisions for the reservation or dedication of
land or monetary exactions of the developer, shall be considered an
administrative adjustment, and is not an amendment, and no public hearing shall
be required, unless otherwise determined by the Planning Director.
   (M)   Periodic review. The Planning Commission shall, not less than once
every 12 months from the effective date of the development agreement, review
the same for compliance with its terms and conditions. The Planning Commission
shall determine upon the basis of substantial evidence whether or not, for the
period under review, there has been compliance in good faith with the terms and
conditions of the agreement. After the public hearing, the Planning Commission
shall render its decision in the form of a written report to the City Council.
If the Planning Commission determines that there has not been compliance in
good faith with the terms and conditions of the agreement, the Commission may
include in its report a recommendation for the modification or termination of
the agreement.
   (N)   Hearing following periodic review.
      1.   The City Council shall place the report of the Commission on its
agenda at the second regularly scheduled City Council meeting following the
receipt of the Planning Commission report by the City Council.
      2.   If the Planning Commission reports that there has been compliance in
good faith with the terms and conditions of the agreement for the period under
review, the City Council shall accept the report for filing and shall not take
any further action unless:
         (a)   The City Council, on its own motion, votes to set the matter for
public hearing; and
         (b)   An appeal is filed with the City Council from the determination
of the Planning Commission within 15 days of the Planning Commission’s report.
      3.   If the Planning Commission reports that there has not been
compliance in good faith with the terms and conditions of the agreement for the
period under review, the City Council shall hold a public hearing to consider
the report and recommendations of the Commission. Notice shall be given as
provided in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65867, 65090 and 65091.
      4.   At the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Council may refer
the matter to the Planning Commission for a further report and recommendation
or it may make a final determination on whether or not there has been
compliance in good faith with the terms and conditions of the agreement.
      5.   If the City Council finds and determines, on the basis of
substantial evidence, that there has not been compliance in good faith with the
terms and conditions of the agreement for the period under review, the City
Council may terminate the agreement or impose those conditions which it
considers necessary and appropriate to protect the interests of the city. Any
court action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void or annul the
final determination by the City Council shall be commenced within 60 days from
the date upon which a final determination is made by the City Council.
   (O)   Cancellation or termination of development agreement.
      1.   Intent to cancel or terminate a development agreement shall be
subject to the same public notice and hearing process as adoption of the
agreement.
      2.   Any development agreement may be canceled by mutual consent of the
parties. Following a public hearing by the Planning Commission and City
Council, the Council shall adopt a resolution canceling the development
agreement.
   (P)   Termination of the development agreement by the city.
      1.   If, at any time during the term of a development agreement, the
Planning Director finds, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the
developer has not complied in good faith with the terms and conditions of the
development agreement, the Planning Commission will conduct a public hearing,
at which time the developer must demonstrate good faith compliance with the
terms of the development agreement.
         (a)   The burden of proof to show substantial evidence of compliance
by the developer shall be upon the developer.
         (b)   If such compliance has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the City Council, they will terminate the development agreement or recommend
new terms and conditions intended to remedy the noncompliance.
      2.   The City Council shall review the recommendation of the Planning
Commission at which time the developer and any other interested persons shall
be entitled to submit such evidence and testimony as may be germane to the
issue of the developer’s good faith compliance with the terms of the
development agreement.
         (a)   If the City Council finds, based upon substantial evidence,
noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the development agreement, the
City Council may either cancel the development agreement upon giving 60 days’
notice to the developer or, in its discretion, may allow new terms and
conditions intended to remedy such noncompliance;
         (b)   The City Council may impose such conditions to the action it
takes as it considers necessary to protect the interests of the city; and
         (c)   The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   (Q)   Rights of the parties after cancellation or termination. In the event
that a development agreement should be canceled, or otherwise terminated,
unless otherwise agreed, all rights of the developer, property owner, or
successors in interest under the development agreement shall terminate.
      1.   Any and all benefits, including money or land, received by the city
shall be retained by the city. Notwithstanding the above provision, any
termination of the development agreement shall not prevent the developer from
completing and occupying a building or other improvements authorized pursuant
to a valid building permit previously approved by the city or under
construction at the time of termination.
      2.   The city may take any action permitted by law to prevent, stop or
correct any violation of law occurring during and after construction, and the
developer or any tenant shall not occupy any portion of the project or any
building not authorized by a previously issued building permit.
(Ord. 553, passed 8-16-2005)
§ 5-6-4 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Violation, enforcement and penalty.
      1.   Any building or structure set up, erected, constructed, altered,
enlarged, converted, moved or maintained contrary to the provisions of this
title, and any use of any land, building or premises established, conducted,
operated or maintained contrary to the provisions of this title shall be, and
the same is hereby declared to be, unlawful and a public nuisance and the City
Attorney shall, upon order of the City Council, immediately commence action or
proceeding for the abatement and removal and enjoinment thereof in the manner

for herein shall be cumulative and exclusive.
      2.   Any person violating or causing violation of any of the provisions
of this title shall be subject to the prosecution of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall be punishable as provided in §
1-4-1 of this code.
      3.   All permits and licenses issued shall conform to the provisions of
this title, and in no case shall a permit or license be issued for uses,
buildings or purposes in conflict with the provisions of this title. Any such
license or permit issued in conflict with the provisions of this title shall be
null and void.
      4.   It shall be the duty of the City Manager or his or her designee to
enforce the provisions of this title pertaining to the use of lands, buildings
or structures, the erection, construction, reconstruction, moving, alterations
or additions to any buildings or structures.
      5.   Any building or structure erected, constructed or moved or

(Ord. 553, passed 8-16-2005)
§ 5-6-5 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Intent.
      1.   Within the districts established by this section or amendments that
may be adopted there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures
which were lawful before this section was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this section.
      2.   It is the intent of this section to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses
are declared by this section to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this section that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
      3.   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this section by the addition of other uses of a nature which
would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
      4.   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this section shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this section and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided
that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record; single-family dwellings.
      1.   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this section, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
section. Such lots must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving the area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of
area, width and yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the
Planning Commission.
      2.   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, lots
that are 25 feet or less exist with continuous frontage in single ownership of
record at the time of the passage or amendment of this section, and if all or
part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as
established by this section, the lands involved shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel for the purposes of this section, and no portion of said
parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area
requirements established by this section for single-family homes, nor shall any
division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or
area below the requirements stated in this section.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this section, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this section as enacted or amended, such may be
continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
      1.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this section.
      2.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this section.
      3.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this section for the district in which such
land is located.
         (a)   Nonconforming agricultural uses. Due to the nature of
agricultural activities, use of agricultural land may cease for six months or
more in the normal course of farming. If the legal nonconforming use status of
a property used for agriculture is lost due to its inactivity for six months,
the property owner may apply for a conditional use permit, pursuant to §
5-6-9 of this chapter, seeking to continue the use of the property for
agriculture as a legal nonconforming use.
         (b)   Findings. Prior to granting a conditional use permit to continue
a legal nonconforming agricultural use within the city, the Planning Commission
must make the findings required in §
5-6-9(I)3. of this chapter. The Planning Commission must also find that:
            (1)   The applicant has provided substantial evidence to establish
that the subject property described in the permit application was used for
agricultural purposes, as a legal nonconforming use, within the two years
preceding the application date; and
            (2)   The granting of a conditional use permit to allow
agricultural use of the land described in the permit application will not be
materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or
improvements in the vicinity.
      4.   Failure to comply with all applicable parking, loading and street
improvement requirements for the use shall make that use nonconforming.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this section that could not be built
under the terms of this section by reason of restriction on area, lot coverage,
height, yards, parking and loading, street improvements, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
      1.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in any way unless such
enlargement or alteration brings the structure into conformity with the
regulations for the district in which the structure is located.
      2.   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than 50% of its replacement cost at time of destruction, the city shall allow
the residential property owner to rebuild one time. If the property is
destroyed again, the property owner must receive written authorization from the
City Council if it is going to be rebuilt.
      3.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved.
   (E)   Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in
combination. If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and premises in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
section that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
section, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this section
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure in which it is located.
      2.   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building (whether or not such part was obviously arranged or designed for such
nonconforming use at the time of the amendment of this section) provided a use
permit is first secured for the entire nonconforming use. In no event shall
such nonconforming use be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      3.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to any nonconforming use
provided that the Planning Commission, by making findings in the specific case,
shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to
the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change,
the Planning Commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
      4.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      5.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for
18 months during any three-year period, the structure, or structure and
premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance
with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
      6.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
      7.   Failure to comply with all applicable parking, loading and street
improvement requirements for the use shall make that use nonconforming.
   (F)   Repairs and maintenance/cost limitations. On any building devoted in
whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent the cost of such
repairs do not exceed 25% of the appraised fair market value of the building,
provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of
passage or amendment of this section shall not be increased.
   (G)   Exclusions.
      1.   Any health related repairs, such as removal of lead based paint,
asbestos or mold; repairs necessary for fire safety and other safety features;
repairs recommended by the city building inspector as necessary to correct
building code violations; and, repairs necessary to accommodate special needs
circumstances for the elderly or handicapped, such as shower fixtures, ramps,
security screen doors, additional exterior lighting and the like shall be
excluded from pertaining to the cost limitations of this section. Such
exclusions shall be at the discretion of the city.
      2.   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe
or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, unless the cost of the repairs required to be
made within the time period specified by the duly authorized official will not
exceed the cost limitation in subsection (F) of this section and unless no
structural alterations are required to be made to the building.
   (H)   Use permits. A use permit shall be required for all nonconforming
expansion projects in any commercial and/or residential district. Property
owners of nonconforming structures applying for low interest housing
rehabilitation loans, such as the community development block grant (CDBG),
shall be subject to the use permit process for discretionary review of their
expansion projects. See §
5-6-9, Use Permits, Temporary and Conditional, of this chapter.
   (I)   Appeal hearing:. If the property owner is dissatisfied with the
decision taken by any duly authorized official pursuant to the subsections (A)
through (H) of this section, he or she must file a written appeal within ten
days of the decision of the duly authorized official to the City Council. The
City Council shall set a date for a public hearing and give notice to the duly
authorized official of such appeal. The City Council shall render its decision
within 30 days of said public hearing.
   (J)   Judicial review. The time to appeal a decision of the City Council
pursuant to this section shall be governed by the provisions of Cal. Code of
Civil Procedure § 1094.6 as currently enacted.
(Ord. 590, passed 7-5-2011)
§ 5-6-6 PUBLIC HEARINGS; SETTING OF PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary:
   (A)   At the time of the filing of a complete and proper application with
the Planning Commission, the Secretary of the Planning Commission, or the city
planner for any permit, variance, amendment to this title, or rezoning, the
Secretary of the Planning Commission shall determine if a public hearing is
necessary and, if such a hearing is necessary, shall set the hearing in the
manner prescribed by law for regularly scheduled meetings; and
   (B)   1.   At the time of the filing of a complete and proper appeal with
the City Council or the City Clerk appealing a decision of the Planning
Commission, or at any time that a public hearing by the City Council is
required by law, the City Clerk shall set a public hearing in the manner
prescribed by law.
      2.   Where a report or recommendation by the Planning Commission or any
city employee is required by this title to be considered by the City Council
during the public hearing, the City Clerk shall not set the public hearing
until the report or recommendation is filed with the City Clerk unless the City
Council directs the City Clerk to set the hearing before receiving the report
or recommendation in order to expedite the setting of the hearing.
(Ord. 553, passed 8-16-2005)
§ 5-6-7 SITE PLAN AND DESIGN REVIEW.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of site plan and design review is to permit the
city to evaluate site plans and designs of new and existing structures to
assure compatibility, harmony in appearance in neighborhoods, reduction of
negative impacts of nonaesthetic development and orderly development of the
community. Approval of site plan may be conditioned upon the construction of
curbs, gutters and/or sidewalks on the subject property.
   (B)   Application for site plan and design review.
      1.   Site plan and design review shall apply to all DTC, C-1, C-2, C-3,
M-1 and M-2 Districts, as well as all new development in R-2 and R-3 Districts.
      2.   Applications for new developments shall be made on a form prescribed
by the city, together with copies of such site plans and sets of architectural
drawings, if applicable. Site plans shall be drawn to a scale that shall
indicate the full dimensions, topographic features and information necessary
for the Council to make an evaluation of the request. Architectural drawings
shall be of such scale and contain such information as to permit the Council to
make a full evaluation of the outside appearance, color, texture of materials
and appurtenances necessary for the development of the structure.
      3.   Scale drawings of all signs, which will be included within the
subject property, shall also be submitted concurrently with the site plan and
architectural plans of any proposed project.
   (C)   Project description. Site plans shall identify:
      1.   All potentially reflective exterior building materials, location of
the materials in relation to the position of the sun, and to the location of
motorists and other persons within sight of the project;
      2.   The type of activities to be performed, what hours they will be
performed, where on the property they will be performed, and what types of
shielding/screening will be employed;
      3.   Each exterior light source according to type, location, wattage,
height, direction of lighting patterns, type of shielding, when in use, and
whether the light is steady or pulsating. An outline of directly illuminated
areas, including points of overlap between lighting patterns, all streets
within the lighting system, and all adjacent property lines must be submitted
for a lighting plan; and
      4.   Conditions requiring additional review to determine whether
mitigation measures are necessary:
         (a)   Any light source that directly illuminates adjacent properties;
         (b)   Additional indirect illumination of adjacent properties in
excess of one and one-half foot-candles;
         (c)   For pedestrian lighting systems, a point of overlap between
light patterns greater than seven feet; and
         (d)   Intensity of lighting within the physical limits of an area
required to be lighted that is greater than seven foot-candles.
   (D)   Design requirements.
      1.   The provision for benches, telephones and shaded areas at major
transit destinations shall be determined based upon necessity with city
approval during a site plan review procedure.
      2.   The height and scale of new commercial and industrial development
should be compatible with that of surrounding buildings where an established
pattern or character is apparent. New development shall provide a transition
from the height of adjacent structures to the maximum height of new
development.
      3.   All roof equipment shall be screened from a horizontal line of
sight. Ground or interior mounted mechanical equipment with appropriate
screening is encouraged as an alternative to roof mounting.
      4.   Entries shall be protected from the elements and shall create a
focus or sense of entry for the building. Use of wall recesses, roof overhangs,
canopies, arches, signs and similar architectural features shall be integral
elements of the building’s design.
      5.   Buildings, landscaping, parking and other development features shall
be arranged in a manner that is compatible with the size, scale and appearance
of nearby development.
      6.   Site planning shall emphasize a strong relationship to the adjoining
street(s) and encourage pedestrian circulation and access. Pedestrian access
shall be separate from vehicular access, where feasible.
      7.   Site plans shall provide safe and well defined pedestrian
connections from buildings to parking areas, from buildings to the adjoining
street(s), and among buildings on the same site. Pedestrian connections between
commercial development and surrounding residential neighborhoods should also be
provided.
      8.   Buildings, sidewalks and parking lots shall be located to minimize
conflicts between pedestrian and vehicular circulation on a site.
      9.   On site circulation shall be designed to provide safe and efficient
access for delivery vehicles, visitors and employees, and pedestrians.
      10.   Loading and trash facilities shall be located where they may be
adequately screened from view, generally at the rear of the structures, away
from the street.
      11.   Long expanses of fence shall be offset and architecturally designed
to prevent monotony. Landscaped pockets and limited openings are encouraged.
      12.   Where industrial development abuts nonindustrial uses, appropriate
buffering techniques shall be employed such as setbacks or screening
landscaping.
      13.   Site design for new industrial development shall consider the
following:
         (a)   Controlled site access;
         (b)   Service, storage and loading areas located at the rear or side
of buildings;
         (c)   Screened storage and outdoor work areas and equipment;
         (d)   Landscaping, signage and other features that emphasize the main
entrance; and
         (e)   Landscaping provided for all areas not developed for parking,

      6.   Materials requiring high maintenance (such as stained wood, shingles
or light gauge metal siding);
      7.   Mirror window glazing;
      8.   Loading doors facing the street; and
      9.   Exposed roof drains.
   (F)   Design review process. The Planning Commission shall be the
recommending body, with the City Council as the approving body of the design
review process. Upon submission of drawings and applications for review, the
Planning Commission and City Council shall meet and render a written report
recommending approval, approval with conditions, or denial. The City Council
shall make final approval.

§ 5-6-8 SPECIFIC PLANS; INTENT.
   Specific plans may be utilized for development areas requiring specific
goals. Any specific plan shall be subject to the requirements of Cal. Gov’t

(Ord. 553, passed 8-16-2005)
§ 5-6-9 USE PERMITS, TEMPORARY AND CONDITIONAL.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. Use permits are used primarily to review the
location, site development or conduct of certain land uses that generally have
a distinct impact on the area in which they are located, and/or are capable of
creating special problems for bordering properties unless given special
attention. Conditional use permits may be granted by the Planning Commission,
and temporary use permits by the Planning Director under the conditions of this
section.
   (B)   Temporary use permits. Temporary use permits provide for the short
term use of property and structures that are consistent with the purpose and
objectives of this title. The Planning Director or his or her designee may
process temporary use permits as an administrative review. Following a decision
by the Director, an administrative agreement shall be prepared that outlines
the findings and conditions of the temporary use permit. The Director shall
approve, or approve with conditions, an application for a temporary use permit
after finding all of the following:
      1.   That egress and ingress and off-street parking facilities are
properly designed and adequate to serve the use;
      2.   That the site is adequate in size and location and has the proper
accessibility to accommodate the use;
      3.   That there are adequate public services, including fire protection,
water supply, wastewater disposal and police protection to serve the use;
      4.   That upon termination of the use the site shall be restored to its
original condition. All materials and equipment associated with the temporary
use shall be removed;
      5.   Those reasonable time limits shall be established for the use, not
to exceed 30 days;
      6.   That the applicants for a temporary use permit shall have all
applicable licenses and permits, including fire permits; and
      7.   That the signage for use be approved by the Planning Department.
   (C)   Application for temporary use permits. An application for a temporary
use permit shall be made to the Planning Department on a form prescribed by the
Department. The application shall be accompanied by a fee set by resolution of
the City Council.
   (D)   Temporary use permits; appeal of decision of Planning Director. A
decision involving a temporary use permit may be appealed to the Planning
Commission. An appeal shall be completed by filing a letter with the City Clerk
within ten days of the Planning Director’s determination.
   (E)   Definition of temporary uses and activities. See §
5-2-6 of this title.
   (F)   Conditional use permits. 
      1.   Use permits that are revocable, conditional or valid for a term may
be issued for any of the uses or purposes for which such permits are required
or permitted by the terms of this section. Because of their unusual
characteristics, conditional uses require special consideration so that they
may be located and developed properly with respect to the intent and purpose of
this title and to their effect on surrounding properties. Conditional use
permits require a determination of findings and conditions by the Planning
Commission.
      2.   The Planning Commission may designate such conditions in connection
with conditional and revocable use permits as it deems necessary to carry out
the purpose of this title, and may require tangible guarantees or evidence that
such renditions are being or will be complied with. These conditions may
include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   Dedication of right-of-way, setback, curbs, gutters and
sidewalks;
         (b)   Improvement of vehicle access to the subject property to city
standards;
         (c)   Regulation of height, number of stories;
         (d)   Regulation of the placement of the use or building of the
subject property;
         (e)   Regulation of the nature, hours of operation, extent of use;
         (f)   Regulation of lighted community sports facilities for extended
hours of use;
         (g)   Regulation as to transferability of the use; and
         (h)   Regulation of landscaping for the protection of adjoining and
nearby properties.
   (G)   Recycling locations. Use of parking lots for the establishment of
recycling locations as mandated by the California Beverage Container Recycling
Litter Reduction Act, being Cal. Public Resources Code, Division 12.1,
California Beverage Container Recycling and Little Reduction Act, §§ 14500 et
seq., shall not require a conditional use permit.
   (H)   Application for conditional use permits. Application for conditional
use permits shall be made to the Planning Department in writing on a form
prescribed by the city and shall be accompanied by an established fee or
deposit and copies of plans and elevations showing in detail the proposed use
or building. At least one public hearing shall be held on an application to the
Planning Commission, notice of which shall be given by one publication in an
official newspaper of general circulation in the county at least ten days prior
to such hearing and by posting notice on the property involved at least ten
days prior to such hearing.
   (I)   Criteria. In considering an application for conditional use permits,
the following criteria shall be as follows.
      1.   A conditional use permit shall not be granted for the use
unreasonably incompatible with permitted uses in the area considering damage
and nuisance from light sources, noise, smoke, odor, dust or vibration, hazard
resulting from unusual volume or character of traffic, or congestion of a large
number of persons or vehicles.
      2.   A conditional use permit must be considered in relationship to its
effect on the general plan for the area in which it is to be located. The
conditional use applied for must be in conformance with the general plan land
use map and policies.
      3.   Findings required for approval shall include:
         (a)   The site for the proposed use is adequate in size and shape to
accommodate said use and all yards, spaces, walls and fences, parking, loading,
landscaping and other features required by the applicable zoning district;
         (b)   The site for the proposed use is served by streets and highways
adequate to carry the quantity and kind of traffic generated by the proposed
use;
         (c)   Public facilities are currently adequate to serve the proposed
use or improvements are included in an approved capital improvement plan or
otherwise will be complete prior to the issuance of building permits; and
         (d)   The proposed development is consistent with the general plan. If
granted, it should be made subject to those conditions necessary to preserve
the general welfare, not the individual welfare, of any particular applicant.
   (J)   Appeal hearing. The applicant, or any interested party, may appeal a
decision of the Planning Commission to grant or deny a conditional use permit
application. An interested party is anyone who, in person or through a
representative, presented testimony at a public hearing in connection with the
decision being appealed, or who otherwise informed the city in writing of the
nature of their concerns prior to the hearing. The appeal must be filed with
the City Council within ten days of the Planning Commission’s determination.
The City Council shall set a date for the public hearing and give notice to the
Planning Commission of such appeal; whereas the Planning Commission shall
submit a report to the City Council, setting forth the reasons for action taken
by the Commission prior to the appeal hearing. The City Council shall render
its decision within 30 days of said public hearing.
   (K)   Reapplication. In the event of a denial of a conditional use permit,
reapplication on the same or substantially the same exception to this title on
the same or substantially the same site shall not be filed within one year from
the date of denial.
   (L)   Judicial review. The time to appeal a decision of the City Council
pursuant to this section shall be governed by the provisions of Cal. Code of
Civil Procedure § 1094.6 as currently enacted.

§ 5-6-10 ZONING VARIANCES.
   (A)   Intent. Variances from the terms of this title shall be granted only
when unreasonable and unnecessary hardships or results, inconsistent with the
general purpose of this title, result because of special circumstances
applicable to the property including size, shape, topography, location or
surroundings or the strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions thereof. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to grant
variances from the provisions of this title as may be in harmony with its
purpose and intent. The sole purpose of any variance shall be to prevent
discrimination and undue hardship, and no variance shall be granted which would
grant a special privilege not shared by other property in the same vicinity.
   (B)   Criteria. Before a variance is granted, it shall be shown that:
      1.   There are exceptional and extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the land, building and/or use referred to in the application which
do not generally apply to other land, buildings and/or uses in the same
district;
      2.   Granting of such variance will not adversely affect the general plan
of the city;
      3.   Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of the
substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity and
district denied to the property in question; and
      4.   The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such
vicinity.
   (C)   Application for variance.
      1.   Application for the variance shall be submitted to the Planning
Department and accompanied by an established fee or deposit and copies of
plans.
      2.   At least one public hearing shall be held before the Planning
Commission for a variance, notice of which shall be given by one publication in
an official newspaper of general circulation in the county at least ten days
prior to such hearing.
      3.   If the Planning Commission, following the said public hearing, finds
that the qualifications under this section apply to the land, building or use
for which a variance is sought and that such variance is in harmony with the
general purpose of this title, it shall grant, by resolution, such variance. In
granting any variance, the Planning Commission may impose such conditions
deemed necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this title, and require
such guarantees and evidence that such conditions will be complied with.
   (D)   Appeal hearing. The applicant, or any interested party, may appeal a
decision of the Planning Commission to grant or deny a zoning variance
application. An interested party is anyone who, in person or through a
representative, presented testimony at a public hearing in connection with the
decision being appealed, or who otherwise informed the city in writing of the
nature of their concerns prior to the hearing. The appeal must be filed with
the City Council within ten days of the Planning Commission’s determination.
The City Council shall set a date for the public hearing and give notice to the
Planning Commission of such appeal; whereas the Planning Commission shall
submit a report to the City Council, setting forth the reasons for action taken
by the Commission prior to the appeal hearing. The City Council shall render
its decision within 30 days of said public hearing.
   (E)   Reapplication. In the event of a denial of a variance, reapplication
on the same or substantially the same exception to this title on the same or
substantially the same site shall not be filed within one year from the date of
denial.
   (F)   Judicial review. The time to appeal a decision of the City Council
pursuant to this section shall be governed by the provisions of Cal. Code of
Civil Procedure § 1094.6 as currently enacted.

   (B)   Review and processing project plans. The project plan shall be subject
to review by the Planning Department and subsequent adjudication by the
Planning Commission and City Council as follows.
      1.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on such
application and may recommend to the City Council to approve or conditionally
approve the project plan if it finds the criteria set forth herein has been
satisfied.

Council, after a public hearing, may by ordinance establish a PD Overlay
District; provided, they find that the facts submitted with the project plan
application and presented at the public hearings confirm:
      1.   That each individual unit of the development if built in stages, as
well as the total development, can exist as an independent unit capable of
creating a good environment in the locality and being in any stage as desirable
and stable as the total development;
      2.   That the uses proposed will not be a detriment to the present and
proposed surrounding land uses, but will enhance the desirability of the area
and have a beneficial effect;
      3.   That any deviation from the standard ordinance requirements is
warranted by the unusual design and additional amenities incorporated in the
development plan which offer certain redeeming features to compensate for any
deviations that may be permitted; and
      4.   That the principles incorporated in the proposed project plan
identify unique characteristics that could not otherwise be achieved under the
other zoning districts.

§ 5-6-12 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
§ 5-6-12-1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this §
5-6-12 is to provide a procedure for individuals with disabilities to request
reasonable accommodation in seeking equal access to housing under the federal
Fair Housing Act of 1968, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., and the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act, being Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 12900 through 12996,
(hereafter “Acts”) in the application of zoning laws and other land use
regulations, policies and procedures.
(Ord. 627, passed 4-5-2016)
§ 5-6-12-2 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   1.   A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person
with a disability or his or her representative, when the application of a
requirement of this zoning code or other city requirement, policy, or practice
acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.
      2.   For the purposes of this §
5-6-12, a PERSON WITH A DISABILITY is:
         (a)   Any person who has a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities;
         (b)   Anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or
         (c)   Anyone who has a record of such impairment.
      3.   This §
5-6-12 is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under
the acts.
   (B)   A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or
exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and
use of housing or housing related facilities that would eliminate regulatory
barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of
their choice.
   (C)   A reasonable accommodation may be granted in compliance with this §
5-6-12 without the need for the approval of a variance.
   (D)   REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION as used in this §
5-6-12  means providing a person with a disability or a developer of housing
for people with disabilities, flexibility in the application of land use and
zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures, or waiving
certain requirements, when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing

§ 6-5-3 APPLICATION.
   (A)   This title shall apply only to residential developments. Whenever a
provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by the

a residential development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in
accordance with the provisions hereof.
   (B)   If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the vesting
tentative map statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be
prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for
construction or work preparatory to construction.

§ 6-5-7 VESTING ON APPROVAL OF VESTING TENTATIVE MAP.
   (A)   1.   The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map
shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial
compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Cal. Gov’t
Code § 66474.3.
      2.   However, if Cal. Gov’t Code § 66474.3 is repealed, the approval or
conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to
proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances,
policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is
approved or conditionally approved.
   (B)   Notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, a permit, approval,
extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the
following are determined:
      1.   A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or
the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or
safety, or both; and
      2.   The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state
or federal law.
   (C)   The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not
approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in §
6-5-6 of this chapter if the final map is approved, these rights shall last for
the following periods of time:
      1.   An initial time period of one year;
      2.   Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project
covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin
for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded;
      3.   The initial time period set forth in subsection (C)1. of this
section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a
complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural
review, if such processing exceeds 30 days, from the date a complete
application is filed;
      4.   A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before
the initial time period set forth in subsection (C)1. of this section expires.
If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the City
Council within 15 days; and
      5.   If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building
permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (C)1. through (C)4.
of this section, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the
expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit.
(Ord. 295, passed 2-4-1986)
§ 6-5-8 DEVELOPMENT INCONSISTENT WITH ZONING; CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.
   (A)   Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision
whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in
existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city
may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the
subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the
zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning
ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative
map shall, notwithstanding §
6-5-7(A) of this chapter, confer the vested right to proceed with the
development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance
and the map, as approved.
   (B)   The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set
forth in §
6-5-7(C) of this chapter.
(Ord. 295, passed 2-4-1986)

   Notwithstanding any provision of this title, a property owner or his or her
designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the
ordinances, policies and standards described in §§
6-5-7(A) and
6-5-8 of this chapter and local agencies may grant these approvals or issue
these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable
law.

§ 6-7-3 PRELIMINARY SOIL REPORT AND GEOLOGIC REPORTS.
   (A)   Preliminary soil report. A preliminary soil report shall be prepared
by a civil engineer who is registered by the state, based upon test borings or
excavations unless waived as hereinafter provided. Said borings or excavations
shall be taken at specific locations determined by the City Engineer or at
random locations if no specific locations are established. Not less than one
test shall be made for every 40 lots or ten acres, whichever represents the
lesser area, and in no case shall there be less than two borings for each
subdivision. The City Engineer may require additional tests when he or she
determines the soil conditions within the subdivision are so varied that
additional tests will be needed. If the City Engineer has knowledge of the soil
qualities of the subdivision, he or she may waive some or all of the borings
upon request of the subdivider’s engineer stating he or she is familiar with
the soils and recommends a waiver based upon a soils report previously
performed. The borings shall be at least ten feet in depth. The depth of
borings shall be adjusted to represent soil profiles after any proposed lot
grading and shall take into consideration the soil embankments have been
completed. The preliminary soil report shall contain the following information
as a minimum:
      1.   The expansive qualities of the soils encountered where foundations
are to be placed;
      2.   Recommended bearing values for the soils;
      3.   Whether other soil problems exist which, if not corrected, could
lead to structural defects; and
      4.   Copies of the test boring analysis.
   (B)   Soil investigations.
      1.   If the preliminary soil report indicates the presence of critically
expansive soils, or other soils or fills would be of such depth that
foundations will not rest on original ground, a soil investigation shall be
prepared for each lot in the subdivision by a civil engineer who is registered
by the state. The soil investigation report shall include the following:
         (a)   The physical properties of subsurface formation;
         (b)   The composition of subsurface soil and rock and groundwater
conditions;
         (c)   The stability of anticipated cut or fill slopes;
         (d)   The general type of site grading; and
         (e)   Recommendations on corrective actions which are likely to
prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be constructed. These
recommendations may include the requirement that the corrective work must be
under the supervision of a registered civil engineer.
      2.   The soil investigation shall be reviewed by the City Engineer who
shall approve the investigation if he or she determines that the recommended
action is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be
constructed.
   (C)   Waiver of soil report. The City Engineer or City Manager may waive the
preliminary soil report if he or she has knowledge of the soil qualities within
the subdivision upon request of the subdivider’s engineer stating he or she is
familiar with the soils and recommends a waiver based upon a soils report
previously performed.
   (D)   Approval where soils problems exist. The City Council may approve the
subdivision or portion thereof where soils problems exist if it determines that
the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure
to be constructed and as a condition to the issuance of any building permit,
may require that the approved, recommended action be incorporated in the
construction of each structure.
   (E)   Notice of soil or geologic report. When a soil report, a geologic
report or soil and geologic report or soils report waiver have been prepared
specifically for the subdivision, such fact shall be noted on the final map,
together with the date of such report or reports, the name of the engineer
making the soil report and geologist making the geologic report and a statement
indicating that the reports are on file for public inspection with the city.

copy of the protective covenants, to the City Engineer for review and report.
   (B)   The Planning Director shall refer all easements for public utilities
to the proper public utility for review and recommendations.
   (C)   The City Engineer or Planning Director shall check and determine the
corrections of surveying data, plans and profiles, and specifications of
improvements, certificates of dedication, acceptances of dedication and
acknowledgments, and such other matters as require checking to ensure
compliance with this title.
   (D)   If the final map and all accompanying materials are in the correct

a request shall be filed with the Secretary of the Planning Commission in the
form of an application therefor furnished by the city.
   (B)   Findings required. The City Council shall waive the requirement for
the filing of a parcel map if, after consideration for the tentative parcel
map, information submitted therewith, the report of the Planning Commission and
any such investigation as it may determine necessary for the purposes of making
its decision, it finds that all of the following conditions have been met:
      1.   That the subdivider has complied with the provisions of §
6-8-8 of this chapter;
      2.   That adequate monuments exist in the field which appear of record in
the office of the County Recorder to permit the retracement of boundaries for
each parcel to be created;
      3.   That no dedications of rights-of-way or easements are offered or
required;
      4.   That all on site and off site improvements as required for parcel
maps by §
6-8-11 of this chapter have been completed; and
      5.   That all proposed division of land complies with requirements as to
area, design, floodwater drainage control, sanitary disposal facilities, water
supply availability, environmental protection and other requirements of the
Subdivision Map Act and this chapter.
   (C)   Waiver certificate. The instrument evidencing the City Council’s
waiving the requirement for a parcel map shall be known as a “waiver
certificate” which shall be prepared by the subdivider and shall consist of the
following form, matters and attachments:
      1.   A description of the boundary of the property proposed to be
subdivided;
      2.   A property plat map prepared by or under the direction of a
registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and legibly drawn, printed,
reproduced by a process guaranteeing a permanent record in black;
      3.   The location of all division lines and the exterior boundary of the
land included within the subdivision shall be indicated by distinctive lines
and clearly so designated;
      4.   The map shall be signed and sealed by the registered civil engineer
or licensed land surveyor;
      5.   A certificate shall be signed and acknowledged by the parties having
record title interest, consenting to the preparation and recordation of the
waiver certificate; and

13 inches. An entirely blank margin of two inches shall be left at the top of
each sheet.
   (D)   Filing of waiver certificate.
      1.   The waiver certificate shall be submitted to the City Manager for
his or her examination prior to filing together with all necessary fees for the
recordation of the waiver certificate and evidence that all fees as hereinafter
required have been paid. The City Manager shall examine the certificate of
waiver, and if he or she finds the same to be substantially in the form
required by this chapter, and in conformity with the conditions imposed by the
City Council in connection with the approval of the tentative parcel map, he or
she shall accept the same for filing and shall submit the same to the Planning
Director.
      2.   Within 20 days after receiving the waiver certificate or within such
additional time as may be reasonably necessary, the Planning Director in
concert with the City Engineer shall determine whether the waiver certificate
is technically correct and conforms with the approved tentative parcel map. If
approved, he or she shall so certify upon the waiver certificate.
      3.   After affixing his or her signature upon the waiver certificate, the
Planning Director shall deliver the certificate to the City Clerk who shall
present the certificate to the County Recorder for filing. When the certificate
is presented to the County Recorder and is accepted by him or her, he or she
shall file and index the same in the official records of the county.
   (E)   Fees. Waiver of the parcel map shall not preclude the payment of fees
as provided by Chapter 12 of this title. Said fee shall be calculated in the
same manner as though a parcel map had been required and shall be paid prior to
the filing of the waiver of certificate with the City Clerk.
(Ord. 295, passed 2-4-1986)
§ 6-8-10 PARCEL MAPS.
   (A)   Map validity. No subdivision that is governed by the provisions of

applicable provisions of this title, and has been so certified by the City
Clerk and referred to and filed with the County Recorder.
   (B)   Proceedings termination. Failure to file a parcel map within two years
after the date on which the tentative parcel map is approved or conditionally
approved by the Planning Commission, or any extension thereof, shall terminate
all proceedings. Before a parcel map thereafter be filed, a new tentative
parcel map shall be submitted and approved. Upon written application by the
subdivider filed prior to the expiration date of the tentative parcel map, an
extension of not more than one year may be granted by the Planning Commission;
provided, however, that no tentative parcel map may be approved for a period
exceeding a total of two years.
   (C)   Parcel map withdrawal.
      1.   In the event the applicant wishes to terminate his or her

Council may release the applicant from his or her agreement to improve and
release to him or her any surety bond or cash deposit which he or she may have
posted upon completion of necessary abandonment proceedings.
      2.   In the event the parcel map has been recorded with the County
Recorder, a revised parcel map may be prepared in the manner prescribed in this
chapter for an original parcel map, and the revised parcel map shall supersede
any previous parcel map.
   (D)   Parcel map; form and content. The subdivider shall file five copies of
the parcel map with the City Clerk not less than 60 days prior to the date on
which the map must be recorded. The format and content of the final map shall
be as prescribed in the following provisions and the Subdivision Map Act:
      1.   The parcel map shall be prepared by or under direction of a
registered civil engineer or licensed surveyor;
      2.   It shall be a map legibly drawn, printed or reproduced by a process
guaranteeing a permanent record in black on tracing cloth or polyester base
film including certificates, except that such certificates may be legibly

base film, the ink surface shall be coated with a suitable substance to assure
permanent legibility;
      3.   The scale of the map is recommended to be one inch equals 50 feet;
except that subdivisions with lots of two and one-half acres or greater may use
a scale of one inch equals 100 feet, or the Planning Director or City Engineer
may require one inch equals less than 50 feet if complexity of detail so
warrants;
      4.   When the parcel map consists of more than two sheets, a key map
drawn to scale of one inch equals 1,000 feet shall be placed on sheet number
one indicating the relationship among all sheets. The particular number of each

and must show a complete reference to the book and page of records of the
County Recorder. The description shall also include reference to any
abandonment with the date, book and page of records of the County Recorder;
      6.   The exterior boundary of the land included within the subdivision
shall be indicated by distinctive line and clearly so designated. The map shall
show the location of each parcel and its relation to surrounding surveys. The
location of any remainder of the original parcel shall be shown, but need not
be shown as a matter of survey but only by reference to the existing record
boundaries of such remainder if such remainder has a gross area of five acres
or more;
      7.   (a)   A lot shall be shown in its entirety on one sheet.
         (b)   The parcel map shall particularly define, delineate and
designate all parcels intended to be reserved for private purposes, all parcels
offered for dedication for any purpose and any private roads, with all
dimensions, boundaries, and courses clearly shown and defined in every case.
Parcels offered for dedication other than for roads, alleys, pedestrian
walkways, water lots or easements shall be numbered consecutively and shall
continue without omission or duplication throughout the entire subdivision.
Each parcel containing an area of one acre or more, excluding public easements
of record, shall have designated thereon the net acreage of such lot shown not
less accurately than to the nearest one-hundredth of an acre.
      8.   Certificate and acknowledgments as are required by the Subdivision
Map Act shall appear on the title sheet of the parcel map, unless their
omission is permitted in the manner provided by the Subdivision Map Act;
      9.   A certificate, either as a separate document or a certificate on the
parcel map, signed and acknowledged by all parties having any record title
interest in the real property subdivided, as specified in the Subdivision Map
Act, Cal. Gov’t Code § 66465;
      10.   A certificate for the City Clerk shall be required where
dedications are offered and shall certify the action of the City Council to
accept or reject the proposed dedications; and
      11.   Evidence of title, acceptance to the County Recorder, shall be
secured from a title company indicating that, as shown by public records, the
parties whose signatures appear on the map and consent to the recordation of
the map are all the parties having a record title interest in the land being
subdivided whose signatures are required by the Subdivision Map Act.
   (E)   Examination of parcel map; Planning Director. The Planning Director
shall examine the parcel map, and if he or she finds the same to be
substantially in the form required by this title, and in conformity with the
conditions imposed by the Planning Commission in connection with the approval
of the tentative parcel map, he or she shall accept the same for filing and
shall then transmit the same to the City Engineer.
   (F)   Examination of parcel map; City Engineer. The City Engineer shall
examine the parcel map and it shall be certified by him or her if he or she
shall find that such map is substantially the same as the approved tentative
parcel map and that the map is technically correct and in proper form as
required by this title and the Subdivision Map Act. Review of the parcel map
shall be completed by the City Engineer within 20 days after receiving the map
or within such additional time as may be reasonably necessary.
   (G)   Verification of improvements. If the subdivider states that the
required improvements, if there be any, or any part of them have been
completed, they shall be inspected by the City Engineer, or any other city
officer designated for such purposes by the Council, and if the same have been
completed in conformity with the requirements of the City Council and
applicable provisions of this title, he or she shall certify such fact on the
parcel map or attach a certificate thereto so showing. If any of the
improvements have not been properly completed, he or she shall attach his or
her report thereof to the map.
   (H)   Completion of improvements or agreement therefor.
      1.   Requirements for the construction of off site and on site
improvements shall be noticed by certificate on the parcel map, or by separate
instrument and shall be recorded on, concurrently with, or prior to the parcel
map being filed for record.
      2.   (a)   Fulfillment of such construction requirements shall not be
required until such time as a permit or other grant of approval for development
of the parcel is issued by the city or until such time as the construction of
such improvements is required pursuant to an agreement between the subdivider
and the city, except that in the absence of such an agreement, the city may
require fulfillment of such construction requirements within a reasonable time
following approval of the parcel map and prior to the issuance of a permit or
other grant of approval for the development of a parcel upon a finding by the
City Council that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for
reasons of:
            (1)   The public health and safety; or
            (2)   The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the
orderly development of the surrounding area.
         (b)   Said findings and requirements shall be made at the time of
approval of the tentative parcel map, and the requirement shall be made on a
condition of approval.
      3.   Agreements as to the time for the construction of required
improvements as provided above may be entered into by mutual agreement of city
and the subdivider. Such agreements shall be approved by the City Council at
the time of approval of the tentative parcel map.
      4.   Conditions of approval requiring improvements by a time specific and
agreements as to the time for the construction of required improvements shall
be accompanied by security to guarantee performance as provided in Chapter 6 of
this title.
   (I)   Final certification. When the City Clerk shall find that the parcel
map is substantially in the form required by this chapter, in conformity with
the conditions imposed by the Council in connection with the approval of the
tentative parcel map, that, where required, the agreement and security
respecting improvements have been approved and filed and that all certificates
of approval herein required have been made, he or she shall endorse on such map
the final certification thereof.
   (J)   Acceptance of dedications. If dedications are offered or required, the
City Clerk shall transmit the parcel map or deeds of dedication to the Council,
which may accept or reject any or all offers of dedication by resolution. If
the offer of dedication is shown on the parcel map, any acceptance and the date
thereof shall be certified on such map by the City Clerk. Dedications shall be
completed prior to filing of the parcel map with the County Recorder. If, at
the time the final map is approved, any streets, paths, alleys or storm
drainage easements are rejected, the offer of dedication shall remain open and
the City Council may by resolution at any later date, and without further
action by the subdivider, rescind its action and accept and open the streets,
paths, alleys or storm drainage easements for public use, which acceptance
shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
   (K)   Recordation of parcel maps. Upon final certification and acceptance or
rejection of dedications, the City Clerk shall deliver the map to the County
Recorder for recordation.
(Ord. 295, passed 2-4-1986)
§ 6-8-11 DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS.
   All divisions of land shall be designed and improvements thereon constructed

   Fees required for filing, or as a condition of the recordation of a final
parcel map, are governed by the provisions of Chapter 12 of this title.

§ 6-9-1 PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS AND BIKEWAYS.
   Pedestrian walkways or bikeways may be required where needed for:
   (A)   Access to schools, playgrounds or parks, shopping centers or other
public areas;

(Ord. 295, passed 2-4-1986)
§ 6-9-2 DEDICATION OF LAND OR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF.
   (A)   Adoption. This section is adopted pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 66477
which provides for the dedication of land or the payment of fees in lieu
thereof for park and recreational facilities as a condition of approval of a
tentative map or parcel map.
   (B)   Fee/dedication. Whenever land that is proposed to be divided for
residential use lies within the boundaries of the city, a fee and/or the
dedication of land shall be required as a condition of approval of the division
of land.
   (C)   Purpose. It is found and determined by the City Council that the
public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety requires that three
acres of land for each 1,000 persons residing within a subdivision shall be
devoted to neighborhood and community park and recreational facilities.
However, if the amount of actual acreage of neighborhood and community park
area existing within the city, as shown on the city’s records, plans,
recreational element, maps or reports as of the date of the most recent
available federal census, per 1,000 members of the total population of the
city, as shown in the most recent available federal census, exceeds that limit,
then the City Council determines that the public interest, convenience, health,
welfare and safety requires that a higher standard, not to exceed five acres of
land per 1,000 persons residing within the city, shall be devoted to
neighborhood and community park purposes.
   (D)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DWELLING UNIT. A building or mobilehome designed for residential
occupancy. For the purposes of this section, the number of dwelling units
created by a land division shall be as follows: one dwelling unit per lot
created in a single-family residential zone; one dwelling per unit approved in
a multi-family residential zone; and where the number of units to be built in a
multi-family residential zone is unknown, the maximum number of dwelling units
allowed under that zone. For a condominium project, the number of dwelling
units created shall be the number of condominium units approved.
      PARK. A parcel or parcels of land, exclusive of natural open space, which
is open and available for use by the general public and which serves the
recreational needs of the public.
      PARKS AND RECREATION PLAN.
         (a)   A general plan and/or other plan for park and recreational
facilities adopted by the city which describes current and planned facilities
and services.
         (b)   Exemptions: this section shall not apply to the following land
divisions:
            (1)   Commercial or industrial;
            (2)   Condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of
the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more
than five years old and no new dwelling units are added;
            (3)   Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used
for residential purposes; provided, however, that a condition of approval shall
be placed on those maps that if a building permit is requested for the
construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the
parcels within four years, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of
each parcel as a condition to issuance of such permit; and
            (4)   Subdivisions subject to development agreements approved by
the City Council, that contain specific requirements for park land dedication
and/or park construction. Such subdivisions shall comply with the requirements
as set forth in the respective development agreements.
   (E)   Adoption and amendment of a parks and recreation plan.
      1.   Prior to requiring a subdivider to dedicate land or pay a fee, or a
combination of both, the city must adopt a parks and recreation plan which
shall be used to plan and direct park and recreation services within the city.
      2.   The city may amend an approved parks and recreation plan at any time
to reflect the needs of the city or when there are pertinent changes in the
city’s boundaries. A parks and recreation plan shall contain a statement of
goals, policies, programs, standards and proposed location and development or
rehabilitation of recreation facilities and services such as natural
reservations, parks, parkways, playgrounds, recreational community gardens and
other recreational areas.
   (F)   Land dedication and fee requirements.
      1.   Whenever a tentative map or a parcel map which is subject to the
provisions of this section is submitted to the city, it shall be accompanied by
a written statement from the applicant stating whether he or she intends to
dedicate land, pay fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for park and
recreational purposes. If the developer desires to dedicate land for this
purpose, he or she shall first consult with the city as to the appropriate area
to be dedicated, and such area shall be shown on the tentative map or parcel
map as submitted.
      2.   The conditions of approval of a tentative map or a parcel map
subject to the provisions of this section shall require the dedication of land,
the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for park and
recreational purposes to serve the future inhabitants of the subdivision. If
the land is to be dedicated, the proposed dedication shall be shown on the
approved tentative map or parcel map. If fees are to be paid, the condition of
approval shall require that the fees be paid to the city.
      3.   The amount and location of land to be dedicated and/or the fees to
be paid shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and
recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision.
      4.   All land dedicated, fees paid, or a combination of both, must be
used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing
neighborhood or community park and recreational facilities to serve the
subdivision.
      5.   The amount and location of property to be dedicated and the amount
of any fees to be paid shall be as approved by the city in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
      6.   Whenever subsequent development occurs on property for which fees
have been paid or land dedicated, no additional fees or dedications shall be
required except as to any additional lots or dwelling units which were not
subject to a prior fee or dedication requirement.
      7.   All dedications of land shall be in accordance with the Subdivision
Map Act. Land shall be conveyed in fee simple to the city free and clear of all
encumbrances except those which will not interfere with the use of the property
for its intended purposes and which the city agrees to accept. All deeds shall
be delivered to the city before the approval of the final map or parcel map. If
the final map or parcel map is disapproved, or if it is withdrawn by the
subdivider, the deeds shall be returned to the subdivider. If the final map or
parcel map is approved, the deeds shall be recorded by the city at the time the
final map or parcel map is recorded. No deed for dedication of land shall be
accepted unless it is accompanied by a policy of title insurance, secured by
the subdivider, in an amount equal to the value of the land dedicated.
      8.   Whenever land has been conveyed or fees paid to the city and a final
map is never recorded or, if recorded, is reverted to acreage, the city shall,
at its option, either reconvey all land dedicated to it, repay all fees paid
without interest, allow the developer a credit for any land dedicated or fees
paid to be applied only to a new subdivision on the same property, or make
other arrangements with the subdivider.
      9.   Land which has been dedicated and accepted may be sold by the city
if the subdivider has not begun substantial construction on the subdivision and
the City Council determines that another site would be more suitable for local
park or recreational facilities. The proceeds from the sale of the land must be
used for the purchase of the more suitable site.
      10.   Whenever fees are to be paid, the fees shall be paid at such time
as is agreed upon by the subdivider and the city through the conditions of
approval. Payment may be required prior to recordation of the final map or
parcel map if the fees are to reimburse the city for expenditures previously
made, or if the city determines that the fees will be collected for park and
recreation facilities for which an account has been established and funds
appropriated and for which the city has adopted a proposed construction
schedule or plan. Payment may be deferred to the date of the issuance of
building permits.
      11.   Whenever fees are paid pursuant to this section, the city shall
deposit them into a separate park fund.
      12.   All fees paid must be used only for the purpose of developing new
or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park and recreational
facilities to serve the subdivision. The development of new park and
recreational facilities includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of
land for neighborhood or community parks for recreational purposes.
      13.   Fees paid pursuant to this section shall be expended for use only
within the boundaries of the city and as specified herein and the city shall
maintain appropriate records to reflect such expenditures.
      14.   A subdivider of any tentative map or parcel map which was approved
prior to the effective date of this section may apply to be reassessed pursuant
to the provisions of this section, provided the fees have not yet been paid
and, in such event, all other provisions of this section shall apply. Upon such
application, the city shall determine the amount of fees required, and the
matter need not be set for hearing before the City Council or the Planning
Commission unless a dedication of land or a credit as provided in subsection
(F)5. of this section is requested by the subdivider or recommended by the
Planning Department.
   (G)   Land dedication and fee determinations.
      1.   Whether the conditions of approval for a land division shall require
the dedication of land, the payment of fees, or both, shall be based on the
following:
         (a)   The natural features of the area; topography; geology; available
access; the location, size and shape of the subdivision; the land available for
dedication; the feasibility of dedication; the location of existing and
proposed park sites and trailways; suitability for patrol, supervision and
maintenance; and the compatibility of dedication with the city’s general plan
and parks master plan adopted by the city;
         (b)   For subdivisions containing 50 parcels or less, only the payment
of fees may be required, provided, however, that when a condominium project,
stock cooperative or community apartment project, as those terms are defined in
Article 2 of Cal. Civil Code Division 4, Part 5, Chapter 1, exceeds 50 dwelling
units, the dedication of land may be required even though the number of parcels
may be less than 50. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from
accepting the voluntary dedication of land by a subdivider for a subdivision
containing less than 50 parcels if the dedication meets the other requirements
of this section; and
         (c)   Whenever the actual amount of land to be dedicated is less than
the amount of land required to be dedicated, the subdivider shall pay fees for
the value of any additional land that otherwise would have been required to be
dedicated.
      2.   (a)   Unless a different number is set forth in the parks and
recreation plan, the average number of persons per unit (density) for
calculating the amount of land to be dedicated or the amount of fee to be paid,
or a combination of both, shall be 4.37 according to the U.S. Census Bureau,
Census 2000.
         (b)   The amount of land to be dedicated or fees paid shall be based
on the residential density of the subdivision and shall be determined by
multiplying the number of dwelling units of the subdivision by the average
number of persons per unit (as determined pursuant to this subsection (G)2.) by
a coefficient equaling the number of acres of park land required per person
(currently set at 0.005).
      3.   Whenever land will be dedicated, the following provisions shall
apply:
         (a)   Whenever land is dedicated, the subdivider shall, without
credit, provide the following for the benefit of the land dedicated:
            (1)   Full street improvements and utility connections including,
but not limited to, curbs, gutters, relocation of existing public utility
facilities, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees and sidewalks
to the dedicated land;
            (2)   Fencing along the property lines of the subdivision which are
contiguous to the park;
            (3)   Improve the drainage through the park site;
            (4)   Provide minimal physical improvements, not including
recreational facilities, building, or equipment, which the city determines are
necessary for acceptance of the land for park and recreational purposes;
            (5)   Provide access from the park and recreational facilities to
an existing or proposed public street, unless the city determines that such
access is unnecessary for maintenance of the park area or use of the park by
the residents of the area;
            (6)   Water, sewer, grading and drainage improvements in addition
to those grading, drainage, irrigation and planting improvements required under
other city ordinances. All land to be dedicated and improvements to be made
should be approved by the city prior to the approval or disapproval of a
subdivision;
            (7)   All grading plans for land to be dedicated shall be reviewed
and approved by the city for conformance with the city’s general plan and any
other parks and recreation plans and the needs of the city; and
            (8)   No grading, drainage, irrigation, planting, street or utility
improvements required under this section shall be eligible for a credit against
the land to be dedicated or fees paid under the provisions of this section.
      4.   Whenever a fee is to be paid in lieu of the dedication of land, the
following provisions shall apply.
         (a)   The amount of the fee shall be determined by multiplying the
number of acres of land required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection (G)2.
of this section by the per acre fair market value of the land within the
subdivision which would otherwise be dedicated.
         (b)   The per acre fair market value of the land within the
subdivision which would otherwise be required to be dedicated shall be based on
the zoning of the property contemplated under the development approval and on
the value of the land within the subdivision as if it were improved only with
those improvements specified in subsection (F)3. of this section. The value of
any structures other than those improvements specified in subsection (F)3. of
this section shall not be considered when determining fair market value.
Alternatively, the fair market value may be determined by adding 20% of the
fair market value of the land (without those improvements specified in
subsection (F)3. of this section), to account for the cost of improvements. The
fair market value shall be determined and agreed to by the City Council and the
subdivider. However, if an agreement on the fair market value cannot be
reached, the subdivider may, at his or her own expense, obtain an appraisal of
the property if the City Council does not accept the subdivider’s appraisal,
the fair market value shall be determined by the City Council after
consultation with the office of the County Assessor for Merced County.
      5.   The subdivider may receive a credit against the payment of fees or
the dedication of land as follows.
         (a)   Common interest developments, as defined in Cal. Civil Code §
1351, shall be eligible to receive a credit, as determined by the City Council,

reserves the right to require in lieu fees if it finds the improvements
unacceptable.
         (c)   (1)   A credit may be given where private areas for park and
recreational purposes are provided in a subdivision and such areas are for
active recreational uses, to be privately owned and maintained in common by the
future owner(s) of the development. Such areas may be credited against up to
50% of the requirement of land dedication or fees at the discretion of the City
Council; provided, that the City Council determines that it is in the public
interest to grant such credits and that all of the following standards either
have been or will be met prior to approval of the final map or development
permit:

maintenance of the area will be adequately provided for by recorded written
agreement, covenants or restrictions;
               C.   That the use of the private area is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by an open space easement or other instrument; and
               D.   That the proposed private area is reasonably adaptable for
use of park or recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as
size, shape, topography, geology, access and location.
            (2)   A.   ACTIVE RECREATIONAL USES means, for the purposes of this
section, recreation facilities occurring on usable level land (5% maximum
slope) in a planned development which are designed to provide individual or
group activities of an active nature including, but not limited to, open lawn,
sports fields, court games, swimming pools, children’s play areas, picnic
areas, golf courses and recreational community gardening;
               B.   Active recreational uses do not include natural open space,
nature study areas, and open space for buffer areas, steep slopes, or scenic
overlooks. Credits for areas within watercourses, drainage areas or water
bodies may be granted only if:
                  i.   Such areas are suitable for active recreational use;
                  ii.   Such areas will actually be used for active recreation;

located within such areas is allowed or otherwise permitted by the city’s parks
master plan or other plan adopted by the city for parks and recreational
facilities.
      6.   (a)   Generally. Notwithstanding the 50% limitation as set forth
above, a private open space credit in excess of 50% of the requirement of land
dedication or fees payment may be granted by the City Council provided that the
proposed recreational use is cited in the city’s general plan or other plan
adopted by the city for parks and recreational facilities.
         (b)   Annual reports.
            (1)   The city shall maintain a separate account for all land
dedications and fee payments received pursuant to this section and shall

               A.   The land dedications and fee payments received, the balance
of the account and the facilities purchased, leased or constructed during the
fiscal year;
               B.   Documentation in support of and justification for the land
dedications, fee payments, fee expenditures and any change in the fee account
balance;
               C.   Information describing any changes in boundaries, service
area, plan goals, policies, standards, as well as, any changes in park and
recreation facility inventory; and
               D.   A schedule of how, when and where the city intends to use
the land dedicated or fees paid, or both, to develop park or recreational
facilities to serve the residents of the subdivisions and the anticipated
starting dates for the development of the park and recreation facilities. The
starting dates shall be reasonable with respect to the need for such parks and
facilities, weather constraints, the need to minimize the disruption of the
neighborhood, the amount of land and fees received, and the anticipated
availability of funds for the operation and maintenance of the parks and
facilities which are constructed.

located, such land as the City Council deems to be necessary for the purpose of
constructing thereon such elementary school or schools as are necessary to
assure the residents of the subdivision adequate public school service, except
that the City Council shall not require the dedication of an amount of land
which would make the development of the remaining land held by the subdivider
economically unfeasible or which would exceed the amount of land ordinarily
allowed under the procedures of the state allocation board.
   (B)   This section shall not be applicable to a subdivider who has owned the
land being subdivided for more than ten years prior to filing of the tentative
subdivision map.

remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible.
   (B)   The reserved area shall conform to the adopted specific or general
plan and shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit an
efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired
within the prescribed period; in such event, the subdivider shall make those
changes as are necessary to permit the reserved area to be developed for the
intended purpose consistent with good subdividing practices.
   (C)   The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall at
the time of approval of the final map or parcel map enter into a binding

§ 8-2-55 MANDATORY RECYCLING OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION WASTE.
   (A)   Threshold for covered projects. The threshold for mandatory recycling
of construction and demolition waste is as follows.
      1.   All construction and renovation projects within the city, the
valuation of which are, or are projected to be, greater than or equal to
$20,000 shall comply with this chapter. The cost of the project shall be the
valuation ascribed to the project by the city’s building official or the city’s
Public Works Director. In addition, all demolition projects having a total
square footage of more than 1,000 shall be a covered project. Failure to comply
with any of the terms of this chapter shall subject the project applicant to
the full range of enforcement mechanisms as set forth in this chapter.
      2.   All city sponsored construction and renovation projects within the
city, the costs of which are, or are projected to be, greater than or equal to
$20,000 shall comply with this chapter. The cost of the project shall be the
valuation ascribed to the project by the city’s building official or the city’s
Public Works Director. In addition, all city sponsored demolition projects
having a total square footage of more than 1,000 shall be a covered project.
These city sponsored covered projects shall submit a recycling plan to the
designated compliance official prior to beginning any construction activities
and shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter with the
exception of enforcement mechanisms and penalties as set forth in this chapter.
      3.   Applicants for construction, demolition and renovation projects
within the city whose total costs are valued at less than $20,000 shall be
encouraged to divert at least 50% of all project related construction and
demolition debris.
      4.   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be listed as a
condition of approval on any building or demolition permit issued for a covered
project.
   (B)   Recycling plan application forms. Applicants for building or
demolition permits involving any covered project shall complete and submit a
recycling plan on a recycling plan form approved by the city for this purpose
as part of the application for the building demolition permit. The completed
recycling plan shall indicate all of the following:
      1.   The estimated volume or weight of such materials that can feasibly
be diverted via reuse or recycling;
      2.   The maximum weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted
via reuse or recycling;
      3.   The vendor or facility that the applicant proposes to use to collect
or receive that material; and
      4.   The estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition debris
that will be landfilled. In estimating the volume or weight of materials
identified in the recycling plan, the applicant shall use the standardized
conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose.
   (C)   Recycling plan review.
      1.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, no building or
demolition permit shall be issued for any covered project unless and until the
city has approved the recycling plan. Approval shall not be required, however,
where an emergency demolition is required to protect public health or safety as
determined by the city.
      2.   If the city determines that the recycling plan is incomplete or
fails to indicate that at least 50% by weight of all construction and
demolition debris is generated by the project, the recycling plan shall be
returned to the applicant and marked “denied” or “further explanation
required”.
   (D)   Compliance with recycling plan. Prior to receiving a certificate of
occupancy or final inspection for the project, the applicant shall submit to
the city documentation that the diversion requirement for the project has been
met. The diversion requirement shall be that the applicant has diverted at
least 50% of the total construction or demolition debris generated by the
project via reuse or recycling, unless the applicant has been granted an
infeasible exemption pursuant to this chapter, in which case the diversion
requirement shall be the maximum feasible diversion rate established by the
city for the project. This documentation shall include all of the following:
      1.   Receipts from the vendor or facility which collected or received
each material showing the actual weight or volume of that material;
      2.   A copy of the previously approved recycling plan for the project
adding the actual volume or weight of each material diverted and landfilled;
and
      3.   Any additional information that the applicant believes is relevant
to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this chapter.
   (E)   Weighing of wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure
that all construction and demolition debris diverted or landfilled are measured
and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the
extent practical, all construction and demolition debris shall be weighed by
measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory
requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition
debris for which weighing is not practical due to the small size or other
considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of
volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized
conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose.
   (F)   Determination of compliance. The city shall review the information
submitted under the provisions of this chapter and determine whether the
applicant has complied with the diversion requirement, as follows.
      1.   Full compliance. If the city determines that the applicant has fully
complied with the diversion requirements applicable to the project, the city
shall approve the recycling plan and inform the building official that a
certificate of occupancy or final inspection can be issued.
      2.   Substantial compliance. If the city determines that the diversion
requirement has not been achieved, or the city has determined on a case by case
basis whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this
chapter. In making this determination, the city shall consider the availability
of markets for the construction and demolition debris landfilled, the size of
the project, and the documented efforts of the applicant to divert construction
and demolition debris. If the city determines that the applicant has made a
good faith effort to comply with this chapter, the city shall approve the
recycling plan and inform the building official that a certificate of occupancy
or final inspection can be issued.
      3.   Noncompliance. If the city determines that the applicant has not
made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, or if the applicant fails
to submit the documentation required by this chapter within the required time
period, then the applicant shall pay a penalty in the amount calculated as 2%
of the total project valuation. After payment of the penalty, the city shall
inform the building official that a certificate of occupancy or final
inspection can be issued.
   (G)   Falsification of records. If the applicant deliberately provides false
or misleading data to the city in violation of this chapter, the applicant may
be subject to penalties in addition to those specified in this chapter. In any
civil enforcement action, administrative or judicial, the city shall be
entitled to recover its attorney fees and costs from an applicant who is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter.
   (H)   Infeasible exemption. The following procedures will be used in
applying for an infeasible exemption under this section.
      1.   If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique
circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the
diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time he
or she submits the recycling plan required under subsection (B) of this
section. The applicant shall indicate on the recycling plan the maximum rate of
diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific
circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the
diversion requirement.
      2.   The city shall review the information supplied by the applicant and
may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways to meet the diversion
requirement. The city may request that staff from appropriate county, state and
federal agencies assist in providing information and in the review process.
      3.   If the city determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to
meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall
determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall
indicate this rate on the recycling plan submitted by the applicant. The city
shall return a copy of the recycling plan to the applicant marked “Approved For
Infeasible Exemption” and shall notify the building official and the Public
Works Director that the recycling plan has been approved.
      4.   If the city determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet
the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing.
The applicant shall have 30 days to resubmit a recycling plan form in full
compliance with subsection (B) of this section. If the applicant fails to
resubmit the recycling plan, or if the resubmitted recycling plan does not
comply with subsection (B) of this section, the city shall deny the recycling
plan in accordance with the chapter.
   (I)   Appeals. An appeal to the decision made by a city staff member may be
made to the City Manager not longer than ten calendar days after the city staff
member’s decision. The decision of the City Manager shall be final. The
applicant must specifically state in notice of appeal the following:
      1.   The name and address of the appellant and the appellant’s interest
in the decision;
      2.   The nature of the decision appealed and/or the conditions appealed;
      3.   A clear and complete statement of the reasons why, in the opinion of
the appellant, the decision or the conditions imposed are unjustified or
inappropriate; and
      4.   Specific facts of the matter in sufficient detail to notify the
city. The appeal shall not be stated in generalities.
   (J)   Civil penalties and enforcement. If the city staff member, or upon
appeal, the City Manager determines that the applicant is in noncompliance as
described in this chapter, the applicant shall pay a civil penalty in the
amount calculated at 2% of the total project valuation. Until the civil penalty
is paid, a certificate of occupancy may be withheld by the building official.
The City Attorney is authorized to bring a civil action in any court of
competent jurisdiction to recover such civil penalties for the city.

a reasonable use of city staff and resources.
   (C)   Enforcement pursuant to this chapter may be undertaken by the city’s
enforcement official, which may be the City Manager or his or her designee,
legal counsel or combination thereof.
    (D)   Process for enforcement shall be as follows.

chapter randomly and through compliance reviews, route reviews, investigation
of complaints and an inspection program. Section
8-2-72 establishes city’s right to conduct inspections and investigations.

entities of its obligations under the chapter.
      3.   For incidences of prohibited container contaminants found in

generator found to have prohibited container contaminants in a container. Such
notice will be provided via a cart tag or other communication immediately upon
identification of the prohibited container contaminants or within three days
after determining that a violation has occurred. If the city observes
prohibited container contaminants in a generator’s containers on more than two
consecutive occasion(s), the city may assess contamination processing fees or
contamination penalties on the generator.
      4.   With the exception of violations of generator contamination of
container contents addressed under § 8-2-73(D)(3) the city shall issue a notice
of violation requiring compliance within 60 days of issuance of the notice.

property or to the party responsible for paying for the collection services,
depending upon available information.

penalty for each violation, further described in §

      3.   The willfulness of the violator’s misconduct;
      4.   Whether the violator took measures to avoid or mitigate violations
of this chapter;
      5.   Evidence of any economic benefit resulting from the violation(s);
      6.   The deterrent effect of the penalty on the violator; and
      7.    Whether the violation(s) were due to conditions outside the control
of the violator.
   (F)   The city may extend the compliance deadlines set forth in a notice of
violation issued in accordance with this section if it finds that there are
extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the respondent that make
compliance within the deadlines impracticable, including the following:
      1.   Acts of God, such as earthquakes, wildfires, flooding and other
emergencies or natural disasters;
      2.    Delays in obtaining discretionary permits or other government
agency approvals; or
      3.   Deficiencies in organic waste recycling infrastructure or edible
food recovery capacity and the city is under a corrective action plan with
CALRecycle pursuant to Cal. Code of Regulations Title 14, § 18996.2, due to
those deficiencies.
   (G)   Persons receiving an administrative citation containing a penalty for
an uncorrected violation may request a hearing to appeal the citation. A
hearing will be held only if it is requested within the time prescribed and
consistent with city’s procedures in the city’s codes for appeals pursuant to
Chapter 18 of Title 1 of this code of ordinances. Evidence may be presented at
the hearing. The city will appoint a hearing officer who shall conduct the
hearing and issue a final written order.
   (H)   Beginning January 1, 2022 and through December 31, 2023, the city will
conduct inspections, route reviews or waste evaluations and compliance reviews,
depending upon the type of regulated entity, to determine compliance, and if
the city determines that organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, tier one
commercial edible food generator, food recovery organization, food recovery
service or other entity is not in compliance, it shall provide educational
materials to the entity describing its obligations under this chapter and a
notice that compliance is required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may
be subject to administrative civil penalties starting on January 1, 2024.
   (I)   Beginning January 1, 2024, if the city determines that an organic
waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, tier one or tier two commercial edible
food generator, food recovery organization, food recovery service or other
entity is not in compliance with this chapter, it shall document the
noncompliance or violation, issue a notice of violation, and take enforcement
action pursuant to this section as needed.

§ 8-6-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
§ 8-6-5-1 EXEMPTED AREAS.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, no regulation
or prohibition of smoking is required in the following areas:
   (A)   Bars and taverns.
      1.   Generally. Smoking is permitted in bars and taverns if they meet the
ventilation standards described below. For the purposes of state law, a BAR or
TAVERN means a facility primarily devoted to the serving of alcoholic
beverages, in which the serving of food is incidental. A bar or tavern can be
freestanding, but also includes those facilities located within a hotel or
motel or other transient occupancy establishment. When a bar or tavern is
located in conjunction with another use, such as a restaurant, the definition
of bar or tavern applies only to those areas used primarily for the sale and
service of alcoholic beverages. Bar or tavern does not include the dining areas
of a restaurant, regardless of whether alcohol is served in them.
      2.   Ventilation standards for gaming clubs and bars.
         (a)   State law permits smoking in gaming clubs and bars/taverns until
the earlier of the following:
            (1)   January 1, 1997; or
            (2)   The date of adoption of regulations by the occupational
safety and health standards board (Cal-OSHA) or the Federal EPA reducing the
permissible employee exposure level to environmental tobacco smoke to a level
that will prevent anything other than insignificantly harmful effects to
exposed employees.
         (b)   If such a regulation is adopted on or before January 1, 1997,
smoking is permitted in gaming clubs and bars, if they fully comply with the
regulations within two years of the adoption of the regulations. If the two
agencies adopt inconsistent regulations, the stricter regulation prevails.
         (c)   If a ventilation standard is not adopted by January 1, 1997,
state law prohibits smoking in gaming clubs and bars. This prohibition remains
until a regulation is adopted. If a regulation is adopted after January 1,
1997, an establishment has two years in which to come into full compliance with
the ventilation regulation. During that time, smoking would be permitted If the
establishment fails to come into full compliance during that two-year period,
then smoking would be prohibited.
   (B)   Private residences. Private residences, except when used as a business
in which more than two people are employed or when used as a childcare or
healthcare facility;
   (C)   Hotel/motel guestrooms. Sixty five percent of guestrooms in a hotel,
motel or similar transient lodging establishment may be set aside for smokers.
This means that at least 35% of hotel/motel sleeping rooms must be nonsmoking
rooms;
   (D)   Retail tobacco stores. Retail tobacco stores;
   (E)   Meeting and banquet rooms.
      1.   Smoking is permitted in meeting and banquet rooms only during
private functions in a hotel, motel or other transient lodging establishment
similar to a hotel, motel, restaurant or public convention center. However,
smoking is not permitted when food or beverage functions are taking place,
including setup, service and cleanup activities, or when the room is used for
exhibit purposes. At a time when smoking is not permitted, the establishment
may permit smoking in corridors and prefunction areas adjacent to and serving
the meeting or banquet room if no employee is stationed in that corridor or
area, other than on a passing basis.
      2.   Thus, if a hotel, motel, restaurant or convention center has meeting
or banquet rooms, smoking is permitted except during food or beverage service,
which includes setup and cleanup.
   (F)   Healthcare facilities. Semiprivate rooms of healthcare facilities
occupied by one or more patients all of whom are smokers who have requested in
writing on the healthcare facility’s admission forms to be placed in a room
where smoking is permitted provided such healthcare facility allows smoking at
said facility.
(Ord. 439, passed 1-17-1995)
§ 8-6-5-2 EXEMPTIONS.
   Only those exemptions provided for in Cal. Labor Code § 6404.5(d) are

Section
8-7-1 Purpose
8-7-2 Definitions
8-7-3 General requirements
8-7-4 Design standards
8-7-5 Location
§ 8-7-1 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Cities and counties must divert 50% of all solid waste by January 1,
2000, through source reduction, recycling and composting activities.
   (B)   Diverting 50% of all solid waste requires the participation of the
residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors.
   (C)   The lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable
materials that are compatible with surrounding land uses is an impediment to
diverting solid waste and constitutes a need for state and local agencies to
address access to solid waste for source reduction, recycling and composting
activities. This chapter has been developed to meet that need.

CHAPTER 8: PROHIBITION AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY INTO WASTE CONTAINERS
Section
8-8-1 Findings
8-8-2 Prohibition
8-8-3 Public nuisance
8-8-4 Penalty
§ 8-8-1 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds as follows.
   (A)   Allowing unauthorized individuals to rummage through waste containers
results in risks to the health, safety and general welfare of city residents.
   (B)   Unauthorized entry of waste containers can lead to intruders obtaining
information for identity theft. Unauthorized rummaging also results in trash
being left in roadways and sidewalks, which impedes the flow of vehicular
traffic and impairs the cleanliness and safety of the city’s rights-of-way.
   (C)   Waste containers left open after the intrusion create a nuisance by
attracting animals and insects.
   (D)   Individuals rummaging through waste containers place themselves in
danger of coming into contact with unknown contaminants.
   (E)   Prohibiting individuals from rummaging through waste containers will
reduce the amount of recyclables being taken from the marked containers. As
part of the city’s solid waste management, the city contracts with private
haulers for the collection of solid waste and recyclables. The city and the
private haulers factor revenues collected by the recyclables in establishing
the collection rates for residents. The theft of recyclable goods increases the
cost of waste collection for the city’s solid waste haulers which may result in
an increase in rates for residents.
   (F)   Allowing individuals to take recyclable goods that are left in
designated waste containers negatively impacts the city’s ability to
demonstrate compliance with the waste diversion mandates of Assembly Bill 939,
being the California Integrated Waste Management Act (IWMA) of 1989, Cal.
Public Resources Code, Division 30, §§ 40000 through 49654.
(Ord. 621, passed 1-20-2015)
§ 8-8-2 PROHIBITION.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, except the owner, or someone with the
owner’s consent, or authorized city, county, state or federal personnel, or
employees of the solid waste company contracted by the city to collect solid
waste and/or recyclables in the performance of their duties, to rummage,
explore, tamper with, move, remove, tip, deface, destroy, scavenge or otherwise
search waste or recyclable containers or the contents thereof.
(Ord. 621, passed 1-20-2015)
§ 8-8-3 PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Rummaging, exploring, scavenging or otherwise searching a waste container,
as prohibited by §
8-8-2 of this chapter, is a violation of the provisions of this chapter and is
hereby declared a public nuisance.
(Ord. 621, passed 1-20-2015)
§ 8-8-4 PENALTY.
   (A)   A violation of this chapter shall be deemed an administrative citation
pursuant to Title 1, Chapter 18 of this code.
   (B)   Any person receiving an administrative citation for violating this
chapter may be punished by:
      1.   A warning for the first violation;
      2.   A fine of not more than $25 for a second violation of the same
section within a 12-month period; and
      3.   A fine of not more than $50 for a third (or subsequent) violation of
the same section by the same person within a 12-month period.
   (C)   Any person receiving an administrative citation may contest the
citation by following the procedures set forth in Title 1, Chapter 18 of this
code (§§
1-18-10 through
1-18-13 of this code).
   (D)   This chapter and the penalties under this section shall be in addition
to any relief provided for under Chapter 2 of this title for violations of §
8-2-15, Scavenging Prohibited, of this title.

CHAPTER 9: CAMPING AND STORAGE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY
Section
8-9-1 Purpose and authority
8-9-2 Definitions
8-9-3 Camping prohibited
8-9-4 Storage of property prohibited
8-9-5 Property removal
8-9-6 Property disposition
8-9-7 Camping permit
8-9-8 Posting copy of permit
8-9-9 Violation
§ 8-9-1 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The streets and public areas within the city should be readily
accessible and available to residents and the public at large. The use of these
areas for camping purposes or storage of personal property interferes with the
rights of others to use the areas for which they were intended. Such activity
can constitute a public health and safety hazard which adversely impacts
neighborhoods and commercial areas. Camping on private property without the
consent of the owner, proper sanitary measures and for other than a minimal
duration adversely affects private property rights as well as public health,
safety and welfare of the city. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain
streets, parks and other public and private areas within the city in a clean,
sanitary and accessible condition, and to adequately protect the health, safety
and public welfare of the community, while recognizing that, subject to
reasonable conditions, camping and camp facilities associated with special
events can be beneficial to the cultural and educational climate in the city.
Nothing in this chapter is intended to interfere with otherwise lawful and
ordinary uses of public or private property.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted consistent with the city’s police power
provided by Article XI, Section 7 of the State of California Constitution and
is necessary to preserve the public peace, safety and general welfare of the
citizens.
(Ord. 630, passed 6-6-2017)

   CAMP or CAMPING. To pitch or occupy camp facilities, or to use camp
paraphernalia to live temporarily in a camp facility or outdoors.
   CAMP PARAPHERNALIA. Tarpaulins, cots, beds, sleeping bags, hammocks, fire
stoves and similar equipment.
   ESTABLISH. Setting up or moving equipment, supplies or materials onto public
or private property to “camp” or operate camp facilities.
   MAINTAIN. Keeping or permitting equipment, supplies or materials to remain
on public or private property in order to camp or operate camp facilities.
   OPERATE. Participating or assisting in establishing or maintaining a camp or
camp facility.
   PARK. Any public space designated as a park by the City of Livingston.
   PERSONAL EFFECTS. Important documents such as birth certificate or driver’s
license, medication, eye glasses or other medical devices, a sanitary and non-
verminous sleeping bag or bed roll, tents in usable and reasonably good
condition, clean and non-verminous clothing stored in a manner protecting it
from the elements, and personal property which would have obvious sentimental
or monetary value to a reasonable person.
   PERSONAL PROPERTY. Property that is movable, as opposed to real property or
real estate.
   PRIVATE PROPERTY. All private property including, but not limited to,
streets, sidewalk, alleys, and improved or unimproved land.
   PUBLIC PROPERTY. All public property including, but not limited to, streets,
sidewalks, alleys, improved or unimproved land and parks.
   STORE. To keep, put aside or accumulate for future use when needed.

facilities, or use camp paraphernalia in the following areas:
   (A)   Any public property; or
   (B)   Any private property.
      1.   It is not intended by this section to prohibit overnight camping on
private residential property by friends or family of the property owner, so
long as the owner consents and the overnight camping is limited to not more
than three consecutive nights, unless a permit is obtained pursuant to §
8-9-7 of this chapter for a period of more than three consecutive nights.
      2.   Nothing in this chapter is intended to prohibit or make unlawful,
activities of an owner of private property, or other lawful user of private
property, that are normally associated with and incidental to the lawful and
authorized use of private property for residential or other purposes; and
provided further, nothing is intended to prohibit or make unlawful, activities
of a property owner or other lawful user if such activities are expressly
authorized by this code or other laws, ordinances and regulations.
      3.   The City Manager, or his or her designee, may, as provided in §
8-9-7 of this chapter, issue a temporary permit to allow camping on public or
private property in connection with a special event or to allow overnight
camping on private residential property that will be more than three

approximate location where the property was left by the owner.
   (C)   Unlawfully stored or found personal effects pursuant to this chapter

CHAPTER 3: UNDERGROUND UTILITIES
Section
9-3-1 Underground utilities
9-3-2 Administrative penalties
§ 9-3-1 UNDERGROUND UTILITIES.
   Utilities serving new development shall be installed underground rather than
by the use of poles and overhead lines, and where applicable shall be installed
in accordance with California Public Utilities Commission rules and regulation.
This requirement applies to electrical service and telecommunications
(including cable TV, telephone and data transmission) connections between
utility company distribution lines and all proposed structures on a site, and
all new installations that distribute utilities within a site. This section
does not apply to the following:
   (A)   New structures on parcels of five acres or larger, or requiring
uninterrupted utility runs of 500 feet or more;
   (B)   Public utility distribution service to the edge of the lot, except in
an underground utility district or where 75% of the lots on the street within
1,000 feet of the site area already developed, and have overhead service from
the utility company distribution source to the residences;
   (C)   Where underground installation may cause a substantial adverse
environmental impact, as determined by the City;
   (D)   Temporary overhead extensions for use during construction and/or for
the purpose of testing the power supply.
   This section may require an applicant to underground utilities from the
utility company distribution source to the site, as well as on the site itself.
The utility service provider should be contacted for information on the Public
Utility Commission's rules and regulations regarding the undergrounding of
utilities. Poles and overhead lines other than those allowed by this section
are allowable subject to Minor Use Permit approval, provided that the City
first finds that either topographical, soil or similar physical conditions or
the distance to the utility company distribution source make the use of
underground utilities unreasonable or impractical.

      2.   The presence at any time on or about any meter, water line or water
main of the city (whether such meter is owned or operated by the city or
others) of a pipe or any other device which diverts water or results in taking
of any water except through an authorized meter shall constitute prima facie
evidence on the part of the person owning or having custody or control of the
premises (where such a device or pipe is located) of the knowledge of the
existence thereof.
      3.   The knowledge of such existence by the person who would benefit by
the failure of the water to be accurately metered, and shall further constitute
prima facie evidence of intention on the part of such person to violate this
section.
   (B)   Meter removal. If water service has been discontinued by the Public

established by resolution or ordinance by the City Council, the water service
may be discontinued until all amounts due are paid. Water service will not be
restored until all leaks have been repaired to the satisfaction of the Public
Works Department.
(Ord. 576, passed 12-16-2008)
§ 9-5-37 WATER METERS.
   (A)   Water metering required. All water delivered by the city to its
customers shall be metered through water meters owned by the city. However, the
City Manager or his or her designees may authorize unmetered water use for
temporary special purposes, and enter into agreements for the assessment of
charges thereof.
   (B)   Submetering. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, occupy
or allow to be occupied any structure in which the construction plan provides
for a master meter and submetering of water consumption of one or more owners
or tenants, unless the plan has been approved by the City Manager or his or her
designees. Each occupied structure and any unimproved parcel shall be served
water through a separate metered connection, except that structures located on
a single parcel and under the same ownership, office buildings, hotels, motels,
apartment houses, courts and multi-family dwellings may be served by a single
metered connection.
   (C)   Meters to be approved by city. The size, type, location and right to
own and control all meters installed or used by consumers of its water shall be
determined by the Public Works Department.
   (D)   Ownership and installation. All meters installed on water service
connections shall be and remain the property of the city and shall be removed
only by the city. Consistent with §
9-5-15 of this chapter, installation of new meters and construction of meter

customer.
   (E)   Maintenance and repair. The city shall maintain and repair all
domestic, commercial and industrial service water meters and shall replace
meters periodically, when necessary, if rendered unserviceable by ordinary use.
When replacement or repairs to any meter are made necessary by the willful act,
neglect or carelessness of the owner or occupant of the premises serviced, all
expenses of such replacement shall be borne by the owner or occupant of the
premises.
   (F)   Testing. If a user submits a written request for a test of his or her
water meter, the Public Works Department may, if the circumstances deem it
advisable, order a test of the meter measuring the water delivered to such
user. If such request to test the meter is made within 12 months after the date
of the last previous test, the user will be required to pay the costs of such
test if the meter is found in such test to record from 97% to 103% of accuracy
under testing methods satisfactory to the Public Works Department. In the event
that the meter is found to be recording less than 97% or more than 103% of
accuracy, the city shall make such adjustments in the user’s bill as are just
and fair under the circumstances.
   (G)   Stopped meters. If meters fail to register at any time, the water
delivered during this period shall be estimated on the basis of previous
consumption. If the user has no previous consumption then a reasonable estimate
may be made by the Finance Department and Public Works Department based on
historical information maintained by the city.
   (H)   Construction meters and roving meters. Construction meters are to be
installed or moved by the contractor under the supervision of city personnel.
Roving meters are to be installed on equipment by the contractor. A deposit may
be required for construction or roving meters owned by the city and will be
forfeited if the meter is lost, damaged or stolen. Meter readings are to be
reported by the user to the Public Works Department or Finance Department
monthly. Failure to provide a monthly meter reading will cause the Public Works
Department to estimate usage and bill accordingly. A minimum charge will be
assessed if no usage is recorded on the meter.
   (I)   Loaned meters. No person shall refuse to deliver any meter or other
appliance loaned to him or her by the Public Works Department for the purpose
of furnishing water through the meter and registering the quantity thereof.

cut off for any purpose.
   (C)   Water pressure. The city shall not be liable for any damage to
plumbing, pipes or fixtures on premises caused by pressure from the city water
system.
   (D)   Notice. While it is the intention of the city to give notice in
advance of any work (which is not considered an emergency) which must be done
that will necessitate any interruption of the supply, such notice is to be
considered a courtesy, and not a requirement on the part of the city. Property
owners must so regulate their installations connected with the water supply

or local pretreatment standard. Any and all costs, expenses or fees incurred by
the city shall be paid by the person.
   (D)   Dilution.
      1.   No user shall ever attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement.
      2.   The Director of Public Works may impose mass limitations on users
who are using dilution to meet applicable standards or requirements.

§ 9-6-14 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS; CATEGORIES.
   Industrial wastewater discharge permits shall be issued under the following
categories, as determined by the Director of Public Works after review of the
permit application as described in §
9-6-17 of this chapter. The Director of Public Works may determine, upon review
of the permit application, that no permit is required for certain small
industries and commercial users.
   (A)   General industrial/commercial user permits.
      1.   General industrial/commercial user permits shall be issued to
certain small industries and some commercial users whose individual discharges
do not significantly impact the POTW, degrade wastewater quality or contaminate
sludge.
      2.   Industries that have the potential to discharge a nondomestic or
process waste stream, but at the present time discharge only sanitary waste,
may also be included in this group.
   (B)   Significant industrial user (SIU) permits.
      1.   SIU permits shall be issued to those industries which are determined
by the Director of Public Works to be significant industrial users (SIUs), as
defined in §
9-6-2 of this chapter.
      2.   The Director of Public Works may require other users to obtain an
SIU permit as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-15 GENERAL INDUSTRIAL/COMMERCIAL USER PERMITS.
   Information similar to that required for a significant industrial user (SIU)
permit will be required for a general industrial/commercial user permit, and
shall be furnished on forms to be provided by the city.
   (A)   General industrial/commercial user permits may contain the same
information, conditions, or requirements as SIU permits.
   (B)   Violators of the conditions of the general industrial/commercial user
permits shall be subject to the same penalties as SIU permit violators.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-16 SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USER (SIU) PERMITS.
   (A)   Permit required. No SIU shall discharge or cause to be discharged any
industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to the POTW owned by the city
without first obtaining an SIU permit from the city.
      1.   Conditions of permit. The Director of Public Works may require an
SIU permit to include pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge,
restriction of peak flow discharges, discharge of certain wastewaters only to
specified sewers of the city, relocation of point of discharge, prohibition of
discharge of certain wastewater components, restriction of discharge to certain
hours of the day, payment of additional costs to defray increased costs of the
city created by the industrial wastewater discharge and such other conditions
as may be required to effectuate the purpose of this chapter.
      2.   Pretreatment standards. Users in industrial categories subject to
the categorical pretreatment standards developed by the EPA under the act are
required to comply with pretreatment standards promulgated pursuant to § 307 of
the Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1317. The city may issue standards more stringent
than the federal standards if the Director of Public Works determines that the
limitations in the federal standards are not sufficient to:
         (a)   Protect the operation of the city’s POTW; or
         (b)   Protect the POTW from violating the water quality standards or
effluent limitations specified in the POTW’s waste discharge requirements.
      3.   Self-monitoring requirements. The SIU permits shall contain self-
monitoring requirements deemed necessary by the Director of Public Works to
ensure compliance with city, state or federal rules and regulations and shall
be submitted to the city for approval. The Director of Public Works may require
any or all of the following:
         (a)   A schedule for complying with effluent limitations;
         (b)   Compliance schedule progress reports;
         (c)   A report on final compliance with effluent limitations and
standards; and
         (d)   Periodic reports on continued compliance.
   (B)   Amended SIU permits.
      1.   No person shall discharge industrial wastewaters in excess of the
quantity or quality limitations set by the SIU permit. Any person desiring to
discharge industrial wastewaters or use facilities which are not in conformance
with the SIU permit or desiring to change its discharge parameters, shall apply
to the city for an amended permit. An amended permit shall be issued before
discharging at limits in excess of the current permit limits. Additional
connection fees will be assessed and paid, for the increase in permit limits,
as provided by Council fee resolution.
      2.   New or increased contributions of pollutants to the city sewage
system by industrial users, where such contributions do not meet applicable
national pretreatment standards and the requirements set forth in this chapter
or where such contributions would cause the city to violate its waste discharge
requirements, are prohibited, and no amended permit shall be issued for such
contributions.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-17 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS; GENERAL PROCEDURES AND

substantially all the assets of the industrial user. All industrial wastewater
discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a
new permit to that user.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-18 WASTEWATER SAMPLING, ANALYSIS AND FLOW MEASUREMENTS.
   (A)   Periodic measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, BOD and suspended
solids for use in determining the monthly industrial wastewater treatment
service charge and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary
by the Director of Public Works shall be made by all industrial users, unless
specifically relieved of such obligation by the Director of Public Works.
   (B)   All such sampling, analyses and flow measurements of industrial
wastewaters shall be performed by a state certified independent laboratory, by
a laboratory of an industrial user approved by the Director of Public Works or
by personnel of the city. Prior to submittal to the city of data developed in
the laboratory of an industrial user, the results shall be verified by a
responsible administrative official of the industrial user under the penalty of
perjury.
   (C)   All wastewater analyses shall be conducted in accordance with the
appropriate procedure contained in the federal guidelines establishing test
procedures for the analysis of pollutants, 40 C.F.R. part 136, test procedures.
If no appropriate procedure is contained therein, a procedure judged
satisfactory by the Director of Public Works shall be used to measure indicated
wastewater constituents. Any independent laboratory or industrial user
performing tests shall furnish test data or information on the test methods or
equipment used, if requested to do so by the Director of Public Works.
   (D)   All users making periodic measurements shall furnish and install at
the control manhole or other appropriate location a calibrated flume, weir,
flow meter or similar device approved by the Director of Public Works and
suitable to measure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A
flow indicating, recording and totalizing register may be required by the
Director of Public Works. In lieu of wastewater flow measurement, the Director
of Public Works may accept records of water usage and adjust the flow volumes
by suitable factors to determine peak and average flow rates for the specific
industrial wastewater discharge.
   (E)   The minimum requirement for self-monitoring shall be at least two
times per year for significant industrial users, whether or not they are
subject to national categorical standards.
   (F)   Industrial users with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of
wastewater may be required to provide continuous sampling and analyses for
every day of operation. When required by the Director of Public Works, users
shall install and maintain automatic flow proportional sampling equipment and/
or automatic analysis and recording equipment, approved by the Director of
Public Works.
   (G)   Each industrial user, including those subject to self-monitoring and
reporting requirements, shall retain for a minimum of three years records of
monitoring activities and results and shall make such records available upon
request for inspection and copying by inspectors and other authorized personnel
of the city. Such records shall be retained during the pendency of any
litigation regarding industrial wastewater discharge or for such additional
periods as may be requested by city, state or federal entities.
   (H)   Analyses of industrial wastewater as required for the enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter and the determination of industrial user charges
will be conducted at the discretion of the Director of Public Works by either
the POTW laboratory or another laboratory approved by the Director of Public
Works. The laboratory performing the analyses shall be certified by the state
for the analyses performed.
      1.   The costs of sampling and analyses performed by the POTW laboratory
shall be paid by the industrial user when, in the opinion of the Director of
Public Works, because of the quantity or quality of the wastes discharged, a
greater number of analyses than normal are required to ensure compliance with
this chapter. The costs for sampling and analyses performed by another
laboratory shall be paid by the industrial user.
      2.   Notwithstanding subsection (H)1. of this section, costs for sampling
and analyses performed in the normal course of monitoring an industrial user,
by the POTW laboratory shall be included as part of the sewer service rates
established in the resolution of the City Council.
      3.   Charges for analyses completed by the POTW laboratory shall be
commensurate with the rates charged by private laboratories for similar
analyses.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-19 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   (A)   Reporting requirements for industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards.
      1.   Base line monitoring reports. Within 180 days after the effective
date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final
administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(a), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to
such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be required to submit to the city a
report which contains the information listed in subsections (A)1.(a) through
(A)1.(g) of this section. If reports containing this information already have
been submitted to the RWQCB or the regional administrator in compliance with
the requirement of 40 C.F.R. § 128.140(b), the industrial user shall not be
required to submit this information again. However, the industrial user shall
provide the city with a copy of such report along with written verification
from the RWQCB that such report items have been received by the RWQCB. At least
90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become
industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the
information listed in subsections (A)1.(a) through (A)1.(e) of this section.
New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the
method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable
pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of anticipated flow
and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
         (a)   Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and
address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners.
         (b)   Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental
control permits held by or for the facility.
         (c)   Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief
description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial
classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This
description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points
of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
         (d)   Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW
from each of the following:
            (1)   Regulated process streams; and
            (2)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e) (see subsection (A)1.(e) of this
section). The city may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where
justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
         (e)   Measurement of pollutants.
            (1)   The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable
to each regulated process.
            (2)   In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling
and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required
by the standard or city) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where
required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations.
            (3)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other
pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The Director of
Public Works may waive flow proportional composite sampling for any industrial
user that demonstrates that flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such
cases, samples may be obtained through time proportional composite sampling
techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates and the Director of Public Works agrees that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
            (4)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection
(A).
            (5)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream
formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the
pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along
with supporting data shall be submitted to the city.
            (6)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto. Where
40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the regional administrator determines that the
40 C.F.R. part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using
validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical
procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other parties,
approved by the regional administrator.
            (7)   The Director of Public Works may allow the submission of a
base line report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
            (8)   The base line report shall indicate the time, date and place,
of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (f)   Certification. The user shall submit a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a
qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met
on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial
user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the user shall submit the
shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional
pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard.
            (1)   Where the industrial user’s categorical pretreatment standard
has been modified by a removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined
waste stream formula (40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different
factors variance (40 C.F.R. § 403.13) at the time the user submits the report
required by subsection (A) of this section, the information required by
subsections (A)1.(f) and (A)1.(g) of this section shall pertain to the modified
limits.
            (2)   If the categorical pretreatment standards are modified by a
removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40
C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40
C.F.R. § 403.13) after the user submits the report required by subsection (A)
of this section, any necessary amendment to the information requested by
subsections (A)1.(f) and (A)1.(g) of this section shall be submitted by the
user to the city within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.
         (h)   Base line monitoring reports. All base line monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with §
9-6-17(B)2. of this chapter.
      2.   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions apply
to the compliance schedule required by subsection (A)1.(g) of this section:
         (a)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation).
         (b)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months.
         (c)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Director of
Public Works no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return the established schedule; and
         (d)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Director of Public Works.
      3.   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline.
         (a)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the city a report containing the information described in subsections (A)1.
(d) through (A)1.(f) of this section.
         (b)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the city in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. §
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long
term production rate.
         (c)   For all other industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period.

accordance with §
9-6-17(B)2. of this chapter.
      4.   Periodic reports on continued compliance.
         (a)   Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the
case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall
submit to the Director of Public Works during the months of June and December
of each year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or
by the city or the approval authority, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a
record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the
reporting period for the discharge reported in subsection (A)1.(d) of this
section except that the city may require more detailed reporting of flows. At
the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors as local high
or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles and the like, the Director of Public
Works may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be
submitted.
         (b)   Where the city has imposed mass limitations on industrial users
as provided for by 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(d), the report required by subsection
(A)3.(a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants by pretreatment
standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
         (c)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the city in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. §
403.6(c), the report required by subsection (A)3.(a) of this section shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long term production rate. For all
other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed
only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by subsection (A)3.(a) of this
section shall include the user’s actual average production rate for the
reporting period.
         (d)   All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
9-6-17(B)2 of this chapter.
   (B)   Reporting requirements for significant industrial users not subject to
categorical pretreatment standards.
      1.   The Director of Public Works shall require appropriate periodic
reporting from those significant industrial users that are not subject to
categorical pretreatment standards at least once every six months (on dates
specified by the Director of Public Works). Such periodic reporting shall
include a description of the nature, concentration and flow of the pollutants
required to be reported by the city. These reports shall be based on sampling
and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in
accordance with §
9-6-18(B) and (C) of this chapter.
      2.   This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of
the significant noncategorical industrial user. Where the POTW itself collects
all the information required for the report, the noncategorical SIU will not be
required to submit the report.
   (C)   Notice of violation; resampling requirement. If sampling performed by
an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within
two hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial
user is not required to resample if:
      1.   The city performs sampling at the industrial user’s facility at a
frequency of at least once per month; or
      2.   The city performs sampling at the industrial user’s facility between
the time when the industrial user performs its initial sampling and the time
when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
   (D)   Notice of potential problems, including slug discharge. In the case of
any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges
of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug
load, that may cause operational problems or damage to the POTW, the industrial
user shall notify the POTW immediately by telephone, followed with a written
notification. Said written notification identifying the reasons for the
discharge and the procedures taken or to be taken to eliminate the discharge
and eliminate the chance of any reoccurrence thereof, shall be submitted to the
city within five days of the occurrence.
   (E)   Report of changed conditions. Each user must notify the city of any
planned significant changes to the user’s operations or systems which might
alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater, at least 90 days before
the change. The user may be required to submit an industrial wastewater
discharge permit application, or an application for an amended permit, in
accordance with §
9-6-16 of this chapter.
   (F)   Notice of discharge of hazardous wastes.
      1.   Every industrial user shall notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261, or Cal. Code of
Regulations Title 22. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user
discharges more than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information:
         (a)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
         (b)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
contained in the wastes;
         (c)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and
         (d)   (1)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place within ten days after the discharge commences.
Any notification under this subsection (F) need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged.
            (2)   However, notifications of changed discharges must be
submitted under subsection (E) of this section. The notification requirement in
this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-
monitoring requirements of §
9-6-18 of this chapter and subsections (A) and (B) of this section.
      2.   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42
U.S.C. § 6921, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or
listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user
shall notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within 30 days of the effective date of such regulations.
      3.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has been
determined to be economically practical.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-20 DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND REPORTED DISCHARGE QUANTITIES.
   (A)   Should measurements or other investigations reveal that the industrial
user is discharging a flow rate, or a quantity of flow, or concentration for
any regulated constituent in excess of that stated on the industrial wastewater
discharge permit or in excess of the quantities reported to the city by the
industrial user and upon which the permit is based, the industrial user shall
apply for an amended permit and shall be assessed for all delinquent charges
together with the penalty and interest provided for in this chapter or in the
industrial wastewater discharge permit issued to the industrial user.
   (B)   1.   For the purpose of establishing the correct treatment service
charge, as required by the city’s service charge schedule, the data obtained in
these samplings along with any other relevant information obtained by the city
or presented by the industrial user, shall be used by the waste disposal
manager in determining the quantity parameters for use in the service charge
formula.
      2.   An industrial user found in violation shall, in the absence of other
evidence, be presumed to have been discharging at the determined parameter
values over the preceding three years or subsequent to the previous city
verification of quantity parameters, whichever period is shorter.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-21 RESTRICTIONS OR REFUSAL OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The Director of Public Works determines that, if sewer capacity is not
available, the city may require the industrial user to restrict its discharge
until sufficient capacity can be made available.
   (B)   The city may refuse service to persons locating facilities in areas
where their proposed quantity or quality of industrial wastewater is
unacceptable in the available POTW.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-22 SEPARATION OF DOMESTIC AND INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS.
   All domestic wastewaters from restrooms, showers, drinking fountains and the
like, shall be kept separate from all industrial wastewaters until the
industrial wastewaters have passed through any required pretreatment system or
device and the industrial wastewater monitoring facility or station.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-23 ADMISSION OF WASTES INTO STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   Industrial cooling waters, blow down from cooling towers or
evaporative coolers, wash water wastes, or waters which are odorless, stable
and free from deleterious chemicals, may be discharged into storm sewers or
stormwater channels if the sewers are accessible and after approval of such
discharge by the Director of Public Works. For the purposes of this section,
any industrial wastewaters, waters or liquids containing less than 25 parts per
million BOD, or which meet the most recent requirement for secondary treatment
as defined by the State Water Resources Control Board, shall be deemed stable.
   (B)   The admission of such waters into the public storm sewers shall be
limited to unpolluted wastewaters provided such discharge does not violate any
provision of this chapter and provided such discharge meets all federal or
state laws and regulations which may be applicable to such discharge.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-24 PARAMETERS ESTABLISHING INDUSTRIAL SERVICE CHARGES.
   The Director of Public Works may classify industrial users to establish an
industrial wastewater treatment service charge based upon average flow quality
and flow quantity adjusted by some commonly recognized parameter selected by
the Director of Public Works that establishes the relative size of the
industrial user being charged.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-25 SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      1.   The costs of operation, maintenance, debt service, equipment
replacement and any and all other costs of administration of the city
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal system shall be levied against
all users thereof in proportion to the quantity and quality of the discharge.
Such charges shall be calculated according to the regulations of the State
Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and shall be adopted by resolution of the
Council. Separate charges shall be established for storm sewer users.
      2.   All users shall be assigned to a classification based on the user’s
principal activity and typical wastewater constituents and characteristics. The
purpose of such classification is to facilitate the regulation of wastewater
discharges, to provide an effective means of source control and to establish a
system of user charges and fees that ensure the equitable distribution of costs
among all users. The system of charges to be established, in accordance with
the requirements of the act and the state clean water grant program shall
provide for the following items:
         (a)   Sufficient financing for an adequate operation and maintenance
program, including competent operating personnel;
         (b)   Funds to be reserved for necessary future replacement,
improvements, and expansions of the facilities; and
         (c)   The city shall adopt a schedule of charges and fees by
resolution to include:
            (1)   Sewer service charges;
            (2)   Storm sewer charges;
            (3)   Septage charges;
            (4)   Other user charges;
            (5)   Connection fees;
            (6)   Fees for monitoring; and
            (7)   Fees for permit applications.
         (d)   The schedule may be amended at any time by resolution of the
Council to reflect increases or decreases in costs.
   (B)   Sewer service charges. The structure of the charges shall be as
follows:
      1.   Single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings and duplexes,
metered or unmetered, shall pay a flat rate sewer charge per family dwelling
unit;
      2.   Mobilehome parks; motels; public institutions; fraternal lodges;
hospitals; nursing homes; churches; restaurants; service stations; automotive
centers; car washes; retail commercial and professional buildings; laundromats;
supermarkets; grocery stores; mortuaries; and other users which shall be
designated by the Director of Public Works shall pay a user charge based on
metered water flow to the premises;
      3.   Schools shall pay a flat monthly sewer service charge based on the
average daily attendance (ADA);
      4.   All POTW users (with the exception of flat rate users) which have
unmetered water supplies shall install meters approved by the Director of
Public Works. Sewer service charges shall be levied based on the metered water
flow. The Director of Public Works, at his or her option, may estimate water
usage and set equitable charges accordingly;
      5.   Industrial users shall pay a sewer service charge based on separate
rates established for volume, mass BOD and mass suspended solids (SS)
discharged;
      6.   The city shall have the option of charging users on the basis of the
volume of wastewaters discharged into the wastewater collection and treatment
system rather than the volume of water used. In such event, the charge for such
volume shall be established by the Director of Public Works; and
      7.   A sewer service charge shall be established by the Director of
Public Works for user classes which have not been listed on the resolution
establishing the rate schedule for each class of user.
   (C)   Storm sewer charges. A charge rate based on the volume of discharge
for approved discharges of other than stormwater to the storm sewer shall be
set by resolution of the Council.
   (D)   Septage receiving station charges.
      1.   A service charge shall be established by the Council for discharging
septage at the septage receiving station.
      2.   The Director of Public Works shall have the authority to establish
additional charges for septage or other wastes discharged at the septage
receiving station which exceed average discharge values of BOD and suspended
solids (SS) concentrations discharged at the septage receiving station by 200%.
   (E)   Inapplicable measurements. For those users of the city wastewater
collection, treatment and disposal system for which the amount of water used is
not an adequate measure of the amount of wastewater disposal into the city
sewer system, the Director of Public Works shall have the authority to
establish a sewer service charge based upon the amount and strength of the
wastewaters discharged by the user.
   (F)   Sewer connection charges.
      1.   A sewer connection fee shall be charged by the city to all customers
connecting to the city sewers. The connection fees shall be used to pay the
capital costs of the city wastewater collection, treatment and disposal system
and, where applicable, recover the costs of constructing sewer mains and
service connections.
      2.   There shall be charged and collected by the city from any person
requesting or making such connection, upon or prior to the issuance of any
permit for a sewer connection or the addition of any fixture units, or for any
increase in permitted discharge strength or volume, a connection fee as
established by the Council.
      3.   Sewer connection charges shall be established by separate Council
resolution and shall be based on the volume discharged and standard strength
residential wastewater concentrations of 200 milligrams per liter for BOD and
200 milligrams per liter TSS. Payment schedules for industrial discharges shall
be established in the industrial wastewater discharge permit and based on
connection charges established by separate Council resolution. (See §9-6-9 of
this chapter for other information.)

      1.   Any person outside the city, who increases the runoff from a lot or
a subdivision by reason of his or her development or use of the land, shall be
required to pay a charge per single-family lot. Charges per single-family lot
and per acre will be set by resolution of the Council.
      2.   (a)   For other than single-family, the charge per acre, based on a
“C” factor of thirty five hundredths used in the rational method formula
described in the ASCE Manual of Practice No. 37, Chapter 4, shall be as set by
resolution of the Council.
         (b)   Any development or use of land producing a runoff factor greater
than thirty five hundredths coefficient shall pay an increased charge in direct
proportion to the increase of the coefficient as determined by the Director of
Public Works, based on the table of average coefficients listed in Chapter 4 of
the ASCE Manual of Practice No. 37.
      3.   Any person who furnishes his or her own disposal of drainage water
from a development without the need for city facilities will not be subject to
a drainage charge.
   (B)   Inside the original city limits. Any person inside the city, who
increases the runoff from a lot or a subdivision by reason of his or her
development or redevelopment of the land which raises the runoff coefficient
above the thirty five hundredths “C” factor of the rational method formula,
shall pay a charge equal to one-half the amount set forth in subsection (A) of
this section.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)

§ 9-6-28 SEWER MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   The service applicant in each instance will be responsible for
constructing any needed sewer main, except that in special cases the Council
may authorize the construction of mains by the city.
   (B)   All such main extensions shall be constructed and tested in accordance
with city approved engineering designs and city specifications.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-29 REFUND AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Lateral connections. The City Council will approve refund agreements
to applicants who construct sewer mains which directly serve off site
properties. Such refunds will be made from service connection charges for
connections to the sewer main constructed by the applicant. The city will
require a connection charge in accordance with the rate schedule adopted by the
Council. The portion of the connection charge which will be distributed in the
refund agreement shall be adopted through a development agreement.
   (B)   Sewer main construction other than oversizing.
      1.   The Council will approve the payment of refunds to the applicant by
the city based on a front foot charge, not to exceed one-half of the original
cost to the applicant, where the applicant’s sewer main benefits other property
owners facing the subject line.
      2.   Again, approval of the amount of distribution in the refund
agreement shall be adopted through a development agreement.
   (C)   Repayment limitations.
      1.   The total repayment by the city to the applicant for:
         (a)   Lateral connections; and
         (b)   Sewer main construction other than oversizing shall not exceed
the original cost of the main construction by the applicant.
      2.   No reimbursement will be allowed for either up line or lateral main
extensions financed by the city or by others.
   (D)   Sanitary sewer lift stations. The Council must approve the payment of
refunds by the city to the applicant for the construction of sanitary sewer
lift stations. Such refunds shall be based on the percentage of the original
cost of the station charged to subsequent developers as determined by the
capacity of the station and a predetermined area of benefit as approved by the
Director of Public Works.
   (E)   Application of refund agreements. This section shall apply to new
tentative maps and existing tentative map time extensions filed and approved
after March 8, 1996. All refund agreements will be adopted through a
development agreement.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-30 OVERSIZED LINES.
   When an applicant is required by the city to construct an oversized sewer
line, the city shall pay directly to the installing applicant or developer the
cost of the oversizing. Such payment will be made from connection fees received
by the city for lateral connections to the sewer, including the connection fees
of the applicant. Only sewers larger than six inches internal diameter shall be
considered oversized; however, if the new development requires a sewer line
larger than six inches for its own purposes, then oversizing will be considered
to be a size requirement larger than that needed to serve the development. The
Director of Public Works is empowered to make the determination as to how much,
if any, oversizing is required and is also empowered to determine the
difference in cost between the actual installation and the average cost of a
six inch (or larger) sewer line. The findings of the Director of Public Works
shall be conclusive.

§ 9-6-39 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Notice. Upon the determination by the Director of Public Works that
any person is in violation of:
      1.   Any provision of this chapter or order issued hereunder;
      2.   An industrial wastewater discharge permit; or
      3.   Any other pretreatment standard or requirement of the city, or is
found to have improperly used or maintained or discharged into the sewer, such
person shall be served by the Director of Public Works with a written notice of
violation. The notice shall describe the time, place and circumstances of each
violation charged, the amount of penalty imposed by the Director of Public
Works for each violation and the corrective measures the industrial user is
required to undertake as a condition of continuation of the industrial user’s
right to discharge into the sewer. The Director of Public Works shall have the
discretionary authority to decline to issue a notice of violation in cases
where violations are insignificantly technical in nature and the public
interest would not be served by proceeding with formal enforcement action. The
Director of Public Works shall keep a record of all such discretionary
determinations.
   (B)   Payment of penalty. The industrial user shall pay the penalty and
complete corrective action described in the notice of violation or shall
identify in writing a proposed arrangement for payment of the penalty and the
corrective action to be taken. Payment shall be made or a plan for payment and
corrective action shall be made and completed not later than 30 days after
service upon the industrial user of the notice of violation. Should the
industrial user fail to take such action within said 30 day period, the
Director of Public Works may issue an order directing the industrial user to
cease and desist discharging into the sewer until payment of penalties are made
or an arrangement for payment of penalties is presented and approved by the
Director of Public Works, and all corrective action is taken or a plan for
corrective action is submitted and approved by the Director of Public Works.
Service of the notice of violation shall be by personal service or registered
mail.
   (C)   Termination of sewer service. Notwithstanding the provisions of §
9-6-17 of this chapter, in the event an industrial user shall fail to comply
with the provisions of subsection (B) of this section, as required, the
Director of Public Works shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure
that the industrial user complies with the provisions of this section
including, without limitation, suspension of an industrial user’s industrial
wastewater discharge permit and physically blocking the industrial user’s
access to the sewer system. All such measures shall remain in effect until the
industrial user has complied with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 497, passed 6-20-2000)
§ 9-6-40 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   In addition to or as an alternative to the issuance of a notice of
violation, if the Director of Public Works finds that an industrial user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit or order issued, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the industrial user’s past violations are likely to
recur, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to the industrial user
directing the industrial user to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the industrial user to immediately comply with all requirements and
take such appropriate remedial or preventive actions as identified in the cease
and desist order to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

including, without limitation, the provisions of this chapter, or any
industrial wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder by the city, may file
with the City Clerk, within ten days of the date of service of such decision,
action or determination, a notice of appeal to the City Council appealing such
decision, action or determination by the Director of Public Works. The notice
of appeal shall set forth in detail all facts supporting the industrial user’s
appeal of the decision of the Director of Public Works. The filing of the
notice of appeal shall stay all further action required under any notice of
violation or cease and desist orders and accumulation of interest upon
penalties thereon, pending final decision by the City Council on the appeal;
provided, however, that nothing stated herein shall limit the authority of the
Director of Public Works to take such action or to make such directives as the
Director of Public Works deems necessary to stop or prevent an ongoing or
threatened violation of any of the provisions of this chapter including,
actions or directives to prevent or stop:
   (A)   Threatened damage to the POTW, the sewer or the wastewater treatment
plant;
   (B)   A pass-through; or

industrial user’s access to the sewer until the appeal is heard and decided by
the City Council.

§ 9-6-42 AUTHORITY OF CITY COUNCIL.
   Upon an appeal brought to the City Council by the notice of appeal, the City
Council shall set the matter for hearing and after said hearing may affirm,

Public Works which is the subject of the appeal. The City Council shall have
the further authority to condition any penalties imposed or the corrective
action required or to reduce or increase the penalties imposed by the Director
of Public Works. Failure of the industrial user to comply with the City
Council’s decision or to make arrangements for compliance satisfactory to the
Director of Public Works within ten days of the date of the City Council’s
decision shall result in the termination of the industrial user’s right to
discharge into the sewer. If the industrial user is discharging pursuant to an
industrial wastewater discharge permit, such inaction shall result in the
termination of the industrial user’s permit. The Director of Public Works shall
thereupon order physical termination of the service forthwith which service
shall not be resumed until the industrial user fully complies with the City
Council’s decision.

County Recorder, said lien will be in effect for a period of ten years unless
sooner released and shall be renewable in accordance with the provisions of

   (A)   Graffiti constitutes an obnoxious public nuisance.
   (B)   The City Council finds that graffiti or other inscribed materials
placed upon any public or privately owned permanent structure located on public

blight or downgrading of neighborhoods and will cause a lessening of property
values in the neighborhoods where graffiti is present. The City Council finds
that graffiti is obnoxious and is a public nuisance.
(Ord. 394, passed 6-18-1991)

the property upon which the graffiti is located, or by depositing such notice
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the owner(s)
thereof at the owner(s) last known address as the same appears on the last
equalized assessment roll of the county. In the event a notice to remove and
consent to enter and release of liability is also given to the person(s) in
possession or control of the property, such notice shall be given in either
manner specified in this section with respect to giving notice to the owner of
the property, and may be addressed to “occupant” or “to whom it may concern”,
if the name of such person(s) is not known.
   (C)   In the event the owner(s) of the property and/or person(s) in

refuses to abide by the City Council’s directive and such costs associated with
city cleanup are not paid, the Director of Finance shall have costs entered
upon the assessment roll under an appropriate head, to be collected at the same
time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and
shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure
for sale and in case of delinquency as provided for in ordinary municipal
taxes; or, if such costs are not paid, the Council may, at its option, by
resolution, order that all of the costs of removal, shall constitute liens upon
the property from which such removal was made, and direct the Director of
Finance to record a certified copy of such resolution in the office of the
Recorder of the County of Merced. The City Attorney shall thereupon proceed to
foreclose each of such liens and to collect all of the amounts owing to the
city in the manner provided by law.

which could not have been reasonably foreseen or mitigated for in advance by
the discharger, as determined by the enforcement official; or
         (s)   Any other activity that the Director identifies is not a
significant contributor of pollutants during the city’s NPDES stormwater
discharge permit for small MS4s’ permit term.
      3.   Written notice. No person shall discharge to public storm drain
system any exempted discharge under this subsection (C) if the Director or
assigned designee identifies and provides written notice to the person that the
discharge has the potential to be a source of pollutants to receiving waters,
waterways, or groundwater;
      4.   Unlawful discharge. No person shall discharge to the public storm
drain system anything that would result in or contribute to a violation of the
city’s NPDES stormwater discharge permit for small MS4s. Liability for any such
unlawful discharge shall be the responsibility of the person causing or
responsible for the discharge;
      5.   Unlawful connections. No person shall establish, use, maintain or
continue any unlawful connection to the public storm drain system which has
caused or is likely to cause a violation of this section. This prohibition is
retroactive and shall apply to any connection that was made in the past,
regardless of whether it was made under permit or other authorization, or
whether it was permissible under the law or practices applicable or prevailing
at the time of the connection. A person is considered to be in violation of
this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to a stormwater
conveyance system, or allows such a connection to continue; and
      6.   Excess irrigation runoff prohibited. Nonstormwater runoff discharge
that is not incidental is prohibited unless otherwise specified in this
chapter. INCIDENTAL RUNOFF is defined as unintended amounts (volume) of runoff,
such as unintended, minimal overspray from sprinklers that escapes the area of
intended use. Water leaving an intended use area is not considered incidental
if it is part of the facility design, if it is due to excessive application, if
it is due to intentional overflow or application, or if it is due to
negligence. No person shall allow irrigation runoff in excess of incidental
runoff to occur. Any person responsible for controlling runoff in excess of
incidental runoff shall:
         (a)   Detect leaks (for example, from broken sprinkler heads) and
correct the leaks within 72 hours of learning of the leak;
         (b)   Properly design and aim sprinkler heads;
         (c)   Not irrigate during precipitation events; and
         (d)   Manage pond containing recycled water such that no discharge
occurs unless the discharge is a result of a 25-year, 24-hour storm event or
greater, and the appropriate regional water board is notified by e-mail no
later than 24 hours after the discharge. The notification is to include
identifying information, including the permittee’s name and permit
identification number.

include in that plan provisions for compliance with this chapter, including the
provisions prohibiting nonstormwater discharge and illegal discharges, and
requiring the release of pollutants to be reduced to the maximum extent
practicable.
      4.   Petition for reconsideration.
         (a)   If a BMP is required by the Director or City Engineer to prevent
a pollutant from entering the public storm drain system, the person receiving
the notice of such a requirement may petition the City Council of the city to
reconsider the application of the BMPs to the premises or activity.
         (b)   The written petition must be received by the City Clerk within
ten working days of the notice issued by the Director or City Engineer. The
petition shall set forth any reasons as to why application of BMPs to the
premises or activity should not be required and any proposed alternatives to
such requirement. The City Council will act within 30 calendar days of the
filing of the petition.
(Ord. 629, passed 2-21-2017)
§ 9-12-9 CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   (A)   Construction.
      1.   Any person performing construction activities in the city shall
prevent pollutants from entering the stormwater conveyance system and comply
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances or regulations,
including, but not limited to, the current California NPDES general permit for
stormwater discharges associated with construction activity (construction
general permit) and the city’s urban stormwater quality management and
discharge control ordinance. All construction projects, regardless of size,
having soil disturbance or activities exposed to stormwater must, at a minimum,
implement BMPs for erosion and sediment controls, soil stabilization,
dewatering, source controls, pollution prevention measures and prohibited
discharges.
      2.   Any person subject to a construction activity NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
enforcement official prior to, or as a condition of, a subdivision map, site
plan, building permit, grading permit, or development or improvement plan, upon
inspection of the facility, during any enforcement proceeding or action, or for
any other reasonable cause. Prior to issuance of a construction permit or
approval of the proposed improvement plans, for projects subject to the state’s
current construction NPDES general permit, the WDID number and the SWPPP shall
be submitted to the city. For projects with less than an acre of soil
disturbance or not subject to the construction general permit, an erosion and
sediment control plan (ESCP) and the ESCP worksheet must be submitted to the
city.
      3.   (a)   As required by its phase II MS4 NPDES permit, the city will
conduct stormwater compliance inspections at applicable construction sites that
have areas of soil disturbance exposed to stormwater. The inspection will be
conducted by a city inspector or agent working for the city who is a qualified
SWPPP practitioner (QSP) or is supervised by a QSP. The inspection will
evaluate the construction site’s compliance to the city’s stormwater
ordinances. Inspections will be billed by the city to the project owner. The
following is the risk rating system and inspection frequency the city will use,
which is analogous to the risk rating used by the California construction
general permit:
            (1)   Projects not subject to the CGP or that have an erosivity
waiver will have a presoil disturbance inspection and a project completion
inspection;
            (2)   Projects that are risk 1/LUP type 1 or risk 2/LUP type 2 will
have a presoil disturbance inspection, monthly inspections, and a project
completion inspection; and
            (3)   Projects that are risk 3/LUP type 3 will have a presoil
disturbance inspection, bimonthly (twice per month) inspections, and a project
completion inspection.
         (b)   If a project has been issued two consecutive notices of
violation or does not correct a previously issued notice of violation by the
due date set by the inspector, the project’s “threat to water quality” will be
elevated by the city to the next highest category. This elevation of risk will
not affect the risk rating for the construction general permit.
   (B)   Violation; liability. Any person performing construction shall not
cause or contribute to a violation of the NPDES stormwater discharge permit
issued by the SWRCB to the city. Liability for any such discharge shall be the
responsibility of the person causing or responsible for the discharge. Any
person performing construction shall undertake BMPs to minimize pollutants
(including sediments) from leaving the construction site, provide protection
from accidental discharge of pollutants to the public storm drain system, and
comply with the cleanup and notification requirements of this chapter. The site
operator shall ensure erosion and sediment control and control of waste and
properly dispose of waste, such as discarded building materials, concrete truck
washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary waste at the construction site that may
cause adverse impacts to water quality. Such measures shall include the
requirements imposed by federal, state, county or local authorities. BMPs are
site specific and are consistent with the California Stormwater Quality
Association (CASQA) best management practice handbooks or equivalent
guidelines.
   (C)   Petition for reconsideration of BMP requirement. If a BMP is required
by the Director or City Engineer to prevent a pollutant from entering the
public storm drain system, the person receiving the notice of such a
requirement may petition the City Council of the city to reconsider the
application of the BMPs to the premises or activity. The written petition must
be received within ten working days at the issuance of the notice by the
Director or City Engineer and shall set forth any reasons as to why application
of BMPs to the premises or activity should not be required and any proposed
alternatives to such a requirement. The City Council will act within 30
calendar days of the filing of the petition.
(Ord. 629, passed 2-21-2017)
§ 9-12-10 DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
   To reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and minimize typical pollutants
associated with stormwater runoff from development or redevelopment projects,
the city requires that the following measures be implemented as part of the
project for compliance with the NPDES stormwater permit.
   (A)   Site design measures for small development projects.
      1.   Projects that create and/or replace (including projects with no net
increase in impervious footprint) between 2,500 square feet and 5,000 square
feet of impervious surface, including detached single-family homes that create
and/or replace 2,500 square feet or more of impervious surface and are not part
of a larger plan of development shall implement one or more of the following
site design measures to reduce project site runoff and minimize associated
pollutants:
         (a)   Stream setbacks and buffers. A vegetated area including trees,
shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation shall be retained (if existing) or
established to protect a stream system or lake reservoir;
         (b)   Soil quality improvement and maintenance. Improve and/or
maintain the soil through the incorporation of soil amendments and creation of
microbial community;
         (c)   Tree planting and preservation. Plant and/or preserve healthy
established trees including evergreens and deciduous varieties, as applicable;
         (d)   Rooftop and impervious area disconnection. Reroute rooftop
drainage pipes to drain rainwater to rain barrels, cisterns or on site
permeable areas instead of the storm drain system;
         (e)   Porous pavement. Incorporate use of porous pavement, porous
concrete and/or other permeable materials for on site flat work (driveways,
walkways, patios, parking areas and the like) instead of traditional pavement
or concrete;
         (f)   Green roofs. Incorporate use of a vegetative layer grown on a
roof (rooftop garden); and
         (g)   Vegetated swales. Construct an on site vegetated, open channel
swale designed specifically to treat and attenuate stormwater runoff.
      2.   Project proponents shall quantify the runoff reduction resulting
from implementation of one or more of the above site design measures using the
State Water Board stormwater multiple application and report tracking system
(SMARTS) postconstruction calculator or another methodology determined to be
acceptable by the city.
   (B)   Regulated projects. Projects that create and/or replace 5,000 square
feet or more of impervious surface.
      1.   Regulated projects shall implement site design measures, source
control measures, low impact development (LID) standards, and baseline
hydromodification management described in this chapter to effectively reduce
runoff and pollutants associated with runoff. Proponents of regulated projects
shall quantify the runoff reduction resulting from implementation of these
measures.
      2.   Redevelopment projects, road projects, and linear underground/
overhead projects (LUPs) are a special class of regulated project: These
projects shall implement the following special requirements:
         (a)   Increase of more than 50%. Where a redevelopment project results
in an increase of more than 50% of the impervious surface of a previously
existing development, runoff from the entire project (including the existing,
new and replaced impervious area) is regulated; in this case, the entire
project site is considered to be part of the regulated project;
         (b)   Increase of less than 50%. Where a redevelopment project results
in an increase of less than 50% of the impervious surface of a previously
existing development, only runoff from the new and/or replaced impervious
surface of the project is considered part of the regulated project;
         (c)   Road projects and LUPs. Any of the following types of road
projects and LUPs that create 5,000 square feet or more of newly constructed
contiguous impervious surface (either a newly constructed public road project
or new private development projects that fall under the authority of the city),
shall be considered a regulated project; however, treatment of runoff of the
eighty-fifth percentile that cannot feasibly be infiltrated on site shall
follow U.S. EPA guidance regarding green infrastructure to the extent possible.
An LUP that is a discreet location that has 5,000 square feet or more of newly
constructed impervious service shall be considered a regulated project. Types
of projects include:
            (1)   Construction of new streets or roads, including sidewalks and
bicycle lanes built as part of the new streets or roads; and
            (2)   Widening of existing streets or roads with additional traffic
lanes.
               A.   Where the addition of traffic lanes results in an
alteration of more than 50% of the impervious surface of an existing street or
road, runoff from the entire project (including the existing, new, and/or
replaced impervious surfaces) is considered to be part of the regulated
project.
               B.   Where the addition of traffic lanes results in an
alteration of less than 50% of the impervious surface of an existing street or
road, only the runoff from new and/or replaced impervious surface of the
project is considered to be part of the regulated project.
         (d)   Construction. Construction of LUPs;
         (e)   Exclusions. Specific exclusions are:
            (1)   Sidewalks built as part of new streets or roads and built to
direct stormwater runoff to adjacent vegetated areas;
            (2)   Bicycle lanes that are built as part of new streets or roads
that direct stormwater runoff to adjacent vegetated areas;
            (3)   Impervious trails built to direct stormwater runoff to
adjacent vegetated areas, or other nonerodible permeable areas, preferably away
from creeks or toward the outboard side of levees;
            (4)   Sidewalks, bicycle lanes or trails constructed with permeable
surfaces; and
            (5)   Trenching, excavation and resurfacing associated with LUPs;
pavement grinding and resurfacing of existing roadways and parking lots;
construction of new sidewalks, pedestrian ramps or bike lanes on existing
roadways; or routine replacement of damaged pavement such as pothole repair or
replacement of short, noncontiguous sections of roadway. Where pavement is
removed and base rock or soil is exposed, if more than 5,000 square feet is
replaced it is a regulated project and not routine maintenance.
   (C)   Source control measures. Operators of regulated projects with
pollutant generating activities and sources shall implement permanent and/or
operation source control measures, as applicable. Source control measures
consistent with the recommendations from the CASQA stormwater BMP handbook for
new development and redevelopment or equivalent manual, shall be implemented
for the following pollutant generating activities and sources:
      1.   Accidental spills or leaks;
      2.   Interior floor drains;
      3.   Parking/storage areas and maintenance;
      4.   Indoor and structural pest control;
      5.   Landscape/outdoor pesticide use;
      6.   Pools, spas, ponds, decorative fountains and other water features;
      7.   Restaurants, grocery stores, and other food service operations;
      8.   Refuse areas;
      9.   Industrial processes;
      10.   Outdoor storage of equipment or materials;
      11.   Vehicle and equipment cleaning;
      12.   Vehicle and equipment repair and maintenance;
      13.   Fuel dispensing areas;
      14.   Loading docks;
      15.   Fire sprinkler test water;
      16.   Drain or wash water from boiler drain lines, condensate drain
lines, rooftop equipment, drainage sumps and other sources;
      17.   Unauthorized nonstormwater discharges; and
      18.   Building and grounds maintenance.
   (D)   Low impact development (LID) standards. All regulated projects shall
implement low impact development standards designed to reduce runoff and treat
stormwater conforming to the following criteria.
      1.   Site assessment. Developers of regulated projects shall assess and
evaluate how site conditions (i.e., soils, vegetation and flow paths) will
influence the placement of buildings and paved surfaces; this evaluation shall
be used to satisfy the goals of capturing and treating runoff and assuring the
goals of LID are incorporated into the project design. The following methods
shall be used to optimize the site layout:
         (a)   Define the development envelope and protected areas, identifying
areas that are most suitable for development and areas to be left undisturbed;
         (b)   Concentrate development on portions of the site with less
permeable soils and preserve areas that can promote infiltration;
         (c)   Limit overall impervious coverage of the site with paving and
roofs;
         (d)   Set back development from creeks, wetlands and riparian
habitats;
         (e)   Preserve significant trees;
         (f)   Conform the site layout along natural landforms;
         (g)   Avoid excessive grading and disturbance of vegetation and soils;
         (h)   Replicate the site’s natural drainage patterns; and
         (i)   Detain and retain runoff throughout the site.
      2.   Drainage management areas (DMAs). As part of the design, the project
site shall be divided into discrete DMAs. Each DMA shall manage runoff using
site design measures, source controls and/or stormwater treatment and baseline
hydromodification measures.
      3.   Numeric sizing criteria for stormwater retention and treatment.
Regulated projects shall be designed to evapotranspire, infiltrate, harvest/
use, and/or biotreat stormwater to satisfy at least one of the following
hydraulic sizing design criteria.
         (a)   Volumetric criteria.
            (1)   The stormwater runoff volume determined using the formula and
volume capture coefficients in Urban Runoff Quality Management, Water
Environment Federation (WEF) Manual of Practice No. 23/ASCE Manual of Practice
No. 87 (1998); or
            (2)   The volume of annual runoff required to achieve 80% or more
capture, determined in accordance with the methodology in Section 5 of the
CASQA’s Stormwater Best Management Practice Handbook, New Development and
Redevelopment (2003), using local rainfall data;
         (b)   Flow based criteria.
            (1)   The flow of runoff produced from a rain event equal to at
least 0.2 inch per hour intensity; or
            (2)   The flow of runoff produced from a rain event equal to at
least two times the eighty-fifth percentile hourly rainfall intensity as
determined from local rainfall records.
      4.   Site design measures. Site design measures as described in this
chapter shall be used to reduce the amount of runoff, to the extent technically
feasible, to achieve the infiltration, evapotranspiration and/or harvesting/
reuse of the eighty-fifth percentile 24-hour storm runoff event; any remaining
runoff from impervious DMAs may then be directed to one or more bioretention
facilities.
      5.   Source controls. Permanent and/or operation source control measures
as described in this chapter shall be incorporated into the project design.
      6.   Stormwater treatment measures and baseline hydromodification
management measures. After implementation of site design measures, remaining
runoff from impervious DMAs must be directed to one or more facilities designed
to infiltrate, evapotranspire, and/or bioretain the amount of runoff determined
from numeric sizing criteria for stormwater retention and treatment. The
facilities must be demonstrated to be at least as effective as a bioretention
system with the following design parameters:
         (a)   Maximum surface loading rate of five inches per hour, based on
the flow rates calculated. A sizing factor of 4% of tributary impervious area
may be used;
         (b)   Minimum surface reservoir volume equal to surface area times a
depth of six inches;
         (c)   Minimum planting medium depth of 18 inches. The planting medium
must sustain a minimum infiltration rate of five inches per hour throughout the
life of the project and must maximize runoff retention and pollutant removal. A
mixture of sand (60% to 70%) meeting the specifications of American Society For
Testing And Materials (ASTM) C33 and compost (30% to 40%) may be used;
         (d)   Subsurface drainage/storage (gravel) layer with an area equal to
the surface area and having a minimum depth of 12 inches;
         (e)   Underdrain with discharge elevation at top of gravel layer;
         (f)   No compaction of soils beneath the facility, or ripping/
loosening of soils if compacted;
         (g)   No liners or other barriers interfering with infiltration; and
         (h)   Appropriate plant palette for the specified soil mix and maximum
available water use.
      7.   Alternative designs. Facilities, or a combination of facilities, of
a different design than described in subsection (D)6. of this section may be
permitted if all of the following measures of equivalent effectiveness are
demonstrated:
         (a)   Equal or greater amount of runoff infiltrated or
evapotranspired;
         (b)   Equal or lower pollutant concentrations in runoff that is
discharged after biotreatment;
         (c)   Equal or greater protection against shock loadings and spills;
and
         (d) Equal or greater accessibility and ease of inspection and
maintenance.
      8.   Allowed variations for special site conditions. The bioretention
system design parameters in subsection (D)6. of this section may be adjusted
for the following special site conditions:
         (a)   Facilities located within ten feet of structures or other
potential geotechnical hazards established by the geotechnical expert for the
project may incorporate an impervious cutoff wall between the bioretention
facility and the structure or other geotechnical hazard;
         (b)   Facilities with documented high concentrations of pollutants in
underlying soil or groundwater, facilities located where infiltration could
contribute to a geotechnical hazard, and facilities located on elevated plazas
or other structures may incorporate an impervious liner and may locate the
underdrain discharge at the bottom of the subsurface drainage/storage layer
(this configuration is commonly known as a “flow through planter”);
         (c)   Facilities located in areas of high groundwater, highly
infiltrative soils or where connection of underdrain to a surface drain or to a
subsurface storm drain are infeasible, may omit the underdrain; and
         (d)   Facilities serving high risk areas such as fueling stations,
truck stops, auto repairs and heavy industrial sites may be required to provide
additional treatment to address pollutants of concern unless these high risk
areas are isolated from stormwater runoff or bioretention areas with little
chance of spill migration.
      9.   Exceptions to requirements for bioretention facilities. If the use
of bioretention or a facility of equivalent effectiveness is infeasible (due to
construction constraints, not financial constraints), other types of
biotreatment or media filters (such as tree box type biofilters or in-vault
media filters) may be used for the following categories of regulated projects:
         (a)   Projects creating or replacing an acre or less of impervious
area, and located in a designated pedestrian oriented commercial district
(i.e., smart growth projects), and having at least 85% of the entire project
site covered by permanent structures;
         (b)   Facilities receiving runoff solely from existing (preproject)
impervious areas; and
         (c)   Historic sites, structures or landscapes that cannot alter their
original configuration in order to maintain their historic integrity.
   (E)   Hydromodification management.
      1.   Projects that create and/or replace one acre or more of impervious
surface are considered to be hydromodification management projects. A project
that does not increase impervious surface area over the preproject condition is
not a hydromodification management project.
      2.   The postproject runoff from a hydromodification management project
shall not exceed the estimated preproject flow rate for the two-year, 24-hour
storm.

   (A)   Every person owning, leasing property or otherwise controlling
property (“owner”) through which a watercourse or publicly owned irrigation
and/or stormwater canal or channel (“watercourse”) originates or passes shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of
trash, debris and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. The owner shall
not remove healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually necessary for
maintenance, nor perform vegetation management in such a manner as to increase
the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The owner shall be responsible
for maintaining and stabilizing that portion of the watercourse that is within
that owner’s property, within regulatory frameworks, to a reasonable standard
as determined by the Director, in order to protect against erosion and
degradation of the watercourse originating or passing through the property.
   (B)   Every owner of property through which a watercourse originates or
passes shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to
a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   (C)   Every owner is responsible to comply with all laws, rules and
regulations of state or federal agencies that may have jurisdiction over
wetlands and waterways. Maintenance must be done in a manner that does not
adversely impact waterway species.
(Ord. 625, passed 12-1-2015)
§ 9-12-13 CLEANUP AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All persons in charge of a facility, activity or development or
responsible for emergency response shall have personal responsibility to train
the premises’ personnel and maintain notification procedures to assure
immediate notification is provided to the city of any suspected, confirmed, or
unconfirmed release of material, pollutants or waste creating a risk of
discharge into the city’s storm drain system. As soon as any owner or operator
has actual or constructive knowledge of any discharge which may result in
pollutants entering the public storm drain system, such person shall promptly
take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery of the source and the extent
and proceed with containment and cleanup of such discharge.
   (B)   The owner or operator shall notify the Director or the City Engineer
of the discharge in both of the following manners:
      1.   By telephone as soon as practical or by calling 9-1-1, if hazardous

compelling interest in preserving the safety of the community generally and
providing a higher degree of protection for its minors specifically during

reduction or discount of the license fee applicable to the license applied for,
and such license shall be renewed within 30 days after its expiration.

within this city or having vaccinated animals residing within the city limits,
shall provide the city with a copy of every rabies immunization certificate
which he or she issues for all animals immunized within the jurisdiction of

scratched or having knowledge of any individual or animal having been bitten or
scratched by an animal of a species subject to rabies shall report the
occurrence of the bite immediately to the Police Department or an animal
control officer. If the bite victim is a minor or is otherwise incapable for
making such a report, the parent or guardian of the minor, or owner of the
animal shall immediately report the incident.
   (D)   Vaccination required. The owner of or person responsible for a dog or
cat four months old or older shall have said animal vaccinated against rabies
within 30 days after it reaches said age or is acquired by its owner or moved
into the city. Any person harboring any such animal shall be responsible for
said vaccination. A vaccinated animal must be revaccinated against rabies at
least every 24 months. This section shall not apply to veterinarian, grooming
salons or kennel operators temporarily maintaining on their premises animals
owned by others, or to an animal in the city for a period of 30 days or less,
provided such animal is restrained and supervised as required by this chapter.
   (E)   Rabies certificate.
      1.   When vaccinating any animal for rabies, the veterinarian shall
complete a certificate of rabies vaccination (in duplicate) which includes, but
is not limited to, the following information:

rabies or that has been exposed to rabies shall be reported by the owner to the
Police Department or animal control officer and shall immediately be confined
in a secure place by the animal control officer. A guide dog serving a blind
master shall be quarantined only in the event that the owner is incapable of
keeping the dog confined to the owner’s premises, or in the event that the
animal poses a serious threat to health and safety.
   (G)   Killing of suspected rabid animals. No person shall kill or cause to
be killed any rabid animal, unless in self-defense. If it becomes necessary to
destroy the animal, the animal control officer shall see that the animal is
euthanized in the most humane manner possible.
   (H)   Rabies control. If it shall appear to the animal control officer that
any animal has rabies, the animal control officer may destroy such animal
forthwith, or may hold such animal for further examination or observation for
such time as the animal control officer may determine to be appropriate.
   (I)   Quarantine. Any animal of a species susceptible to rabies that bites a
person or animal or is suspected of having rabies may be seized and quarantined
for observation for a period of not less than ten days by an animal control
officer. The owner of the animal shall bear the cost of confinement. An animal
shelter authorized by the city shall be the normal place of quarantine, but
other arrangements, including confinement by the owner, may be made by the City
Police Department if the animal had a current rabies vaccination at the time
the bite was inflicted or if there are other special circumstances justifying
an exception. A person who has custody of an animal under quarantine shall
immediately notify the City Police Department if the animal shows any signs of
sickness or abnormal behavior, or if the animal escapes confinement. It shall
be unlawful for any person who has custody of a quarantined animal to fail or
refuse to allow an animal control officer to make an inspection or examination
during the period of quarantine. If the animal dies within ten days from the
date of the bite, the person having custody shall immediately notify the Police
Department or city designated laboratory to be examined for rabies. If, at the
end of the ten-day period, the animal control officer examines the animal and
finds no signs of rabies, the animal may be released to the owner or in the
case of a stray, it shall be disposed of as provided in this chapter. Animals
quarantined pursuant to this section shall remain under quarantine until notice
is given the animal control officer that such quarantine is terminated.
   (J)   Animals dying while under isolation. The intact body or portion
thereof, as specified by the Merced County Health Department laboratory or
other laboratory designated by the city, shall be submitted in the manner
prescribed by the laboratory for examination for rabies.

epidemic of rabies exists or is threatened, the Police Chief shall have the
authority to take such measures as may be reasonably necessary to prevent the
spread of the disease, including, but not limited to, the declaration of
quarantine against any or all animals in any area of the city as the Police
Chief may determine and define, for a period of not more than 120 days. An
additional or extended quarantine period may also be declared if such
additional or extended quarantine period shall be deemed necessary by the
Police Chief for the protection and preservation of the public health, peace
and safety. Any quarantine declared pursuant to this subsection (K), other than
as restricted herein, shall be upon such conditions as the Police Chief may
determine and declare.
   (L)   Quarantine signs. The animal control officer may, in his or her
discretion, post or cause to be posted an appropriate sign on any premises
where an animal is quarantined pursuant to this chapter, for the purpose of
warning the public of the fact of such quarantine. It shall be unlawful for any
person to remove a sign on any premises where an animal is quarantined pursuant
to this chapter, for the purpose of warning the public of the fact of such
quarantine. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove a sign posted
pursuant to this subsection (L) without the permission of the animal control
officer or Police Department.
   (M)   Unvaccinated bitten or exposed animals. If an animal is not vaccinated
against rabies but of a species subject to rabies is known to have been bitten
or exposed by a known rabid animal, then said bitten or exposed animal shall be
immediately destroyed.

for any reason; to transport skunks from or into the city except pursuant to a
permit issued by the California Department of Health Services pursuant to the
Cal. Code of Regulations Title 17, § 2606.8.

exposed animal has been vaccinated, the animal shall be revaccinated within 24
hours and quarantined for a period of 30 days following revaccination; or if

and quarantined under veterinary supervision for six months, the animal shall
be destroyed if the owner does not comply with this subsection (O).

release any quarantined or confined animal from quarantine or confinement
without written permission of the City Police Department.

§ 10-3-46 VICIOUS, DANGEROUS OR FIERCE ANIMALS.
   (A)   Definition. The definition of a vicious, dangerous or fierce animal is
contained in §
10-3-1 of this chapter. No animal shall be declared vicious, dangerous or
fierce if:
      1.   It is owned by a public entity or a governmental or law enforcement
unit used primarily to guard public or private property; and
      2.   The threat, injury or damage was sustained by a person who, at the
time, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises
occupied by the owner or keeper of the animal, or was teasing, tormenting,
abusing or assaulting the animal or has in the past, been observed or reported
to have teased, tormented, abused or assaulted the animal, or was committing or
attempting to commit a crime.
   (B)   Confinement on premises. No person owning or harboring or having the
care of a fierce, dangerous or vicious animal shall suffer or permit such
animal to go unconfined on the premises of such person. A fierce, dangerous or
vicious animal is “unconfined” as the term is used in this section if such
animal is not securely confined indoors, or confined in a securely enclosed and
locked pen or structure upon the premises of the registered owner or caretaker
of the animal. Such pen or structure must have secure sides and a secure top.
If the pen or structure has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be
imbedded in the ground no less than two feet. An animal that is securely and
humanely locked in a motor vehicle belonging to the owner or caretaker shall be
considered confined for purposes of this section.
   (C)   Control off premises. No person owning or harboring or having the care
of a fierce, dangerous or vicious animal shall suffer or permit such animal to
go beyond the premises of such person unless such animal is securely leashed
with a leash not exceeding three feet in length, and muzzled, except that a
dangerous dog shall not be required to be muzzled when either shown in a
sanctioned American Kennel Club show or upon prior written approval of the
city’s Chief of Police.
   (D)   Public notification. The owner or caretaker of any vicious, dangerous
or fierce animal shall display on his or her premises a warning sign that there
is a vicious, dangerous or fierce animal on the property. This sign shall be
capable of being read from the public street or highway. The sign must have
letters at least two inches in width and two inches in height and reading
“Beware Of Vicious Dog”, or “Beware Of Dangerous Dog” or “Beware Of Fierce Dog”
or as otherwise determined by the city.
   (E)   Registering vicious, dangerous or fierce animals. Any owner or
caretaker of a vicious, dangerous, or fierce animal shall register with the
city’s Police Department with the following minimal information: name; address;
telephone number (including work phone numbers), of all responsible parties
relating to the animal, to be updated at the renewal of each license. This will
also include breed, sex, color, weight, age of animal, tattoo number or
embedded chip number, license number and rabies information.
   (F)   Four digit tattoo or microchip identification technology. The owner,
keeper or caretaker shall, at his or her own expense, have a unique
identifying, four digit number tattooed on the inner thigh or a microchip
embedded between the shoulders of the vicious, dangerous or fierce animal. This
number is to be assigned by the city’s Police Department or any person
designated by the city’s Police Department. The tattoo or embedded chip may be
applied by a licensed veterinarian or person trained as a tattooist and
authorized as such by a state, county, city, town or other law enforcement
department. A tattoo shall be applied with an indelible or permanent ink. The
tattoo number or embedded chip number shall be recorded on the license of the
tattooed animal.
   (G)   Police Department notification. The owner, keeper or caretaker shall
notify the city’s Police Department or its designated authority within three
hours if a fierce, dangerous or vicious animal is loose, unconfined, has
attacked another animal or has attacked a human being. If a fierce, dangerous
or vicious animal has died, been sold or has been given away, the owner, keeper
or caretaker must give notice to the city’s Police Department within two
working days.
   (H)   Insurance requirements. The owner or caretaker of a fierce, dangerous
or vicious animal shall present to the city’s Police Department or its
designated authority, proof that the owner or caretaker has procured liability
insurance in the amount of at least $100,000, covering any damage or injury
which may be caused by such fierce, dangerous or vicious animal during the 12-
month period for which licensing is sought, which policy shall contain a
provision requiring the city’s Police Department to be notified by the
insurance company of any cancellation, termination, or expiration of the
liability insurance policy.
   (I)   Strict liability. In the event that a minor is the owner, keeper or
caretaker of a fierce, dangerous or vicious animal, the parent or guardian of
that minor shall be responsible for compliance with the specifications of this
chapter for the care and housing of the animal and shall also be strictly
liable for all injuries and property damage sustained by any person or domestic
animal caused by an unprovoked attack by the animal.
   (J)   Vaccinations. All vicious, dangerous and fierce animals shall obtain
all appropriate vaccinations for the particular species as it relates to the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
   (K)   Damage by vicious, dangerous or fierce animal. If any vicious,
dangerous or fierce animal shall, when unprovoked, kill or wound, or assist in
killing or wounding any domestic animal, or shall, when unprovoked, attack,
assault, bite or otherwise injure any human being or assist in attacking,
assaulting, biting or otherwise injuring any human being while out of or within
the enclosure of the owner or keeper of such animal, or while otherwise, on or
off the property of the owner or keeper whether or not such dog was on a leash
and securely muzzled or whether the animal escaped without fault of the owner
or keeper, the owner or keeper of such animal shall be strictly liable to the
person aggrieved as aforesaid, for all damage sustained. It is rebuttably
presumed as a matter of law that the owning, keeping or harboring of a vicious,
dangerous or fierce animal, in violation of this chapter is a nuisance. It
shall not be necessary, in order to sustain any such action, to prove that the
owner or keeper of such vicious, dangerous or fierce dog possessed the
propensity to cause such damage or that the vicious animal had a vicious,
dangerous or fierce nature. Upon such attack or assault, the animal control
officer or Police Department is hereby empowered to immediately impound the
vicious, dangerous or fierce animal.
   (L)   Enforcement. The animal control officer is hereby empowered to make
whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions
of this chapter, and any police officer or peace officer is hereby empowered to
seize and impound any vicious, dangerous or fierce animal whose owner or
caretaker fails to comply with the provisions hereof.
   (M)   Penalties. In the event that the owner or caretaker fails to comply
with the specifications of this code which include, but are not limited to, any
vicious, dangerous or fierce animal which does not have a valid license in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter; or whose owner or caretaker
does not secure the liability insurance coverage required in accordance with
this chapter; or which is not maintained on property with an enclosure; or
which is found to be outside of the dwelling of the owner or caretaker, or
outside of an enclosure except as provided in this chapter; or which is not
tattooed; shall be impounded by the animal control officer or police officer
and the owner or caretaker is guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 10-3-47 DETERMINATION, SEIZURE, IMPOUNDMENT AND DISPOSITION OF VICIOUS,
DANGEROUS OR FIERCE ANIMALS.
   (A)   Notice and hearing. The animal control officer, police officer or the
Police Chief’s designee, in their discretion or upon receipt of a complaint
alleging that a particular dog is a vicious, dangerous or fierce animal, as
defined in this chapter, may initiate proceedings to declare such dog a
vicious, dangerous or fierce animal. In determining whether or not an animal
shall be declared a vicious, dangerous or fierce animal, the animal control
officer, police officer or Police Chief’s designee may consider, as a
mitigating factor, that the actions of the animal were provoked, as defined in
this chapter. A hearing on the matter shall be conducted by the Police Chief,
which shall serve as the administrative agency set up by the city. The person
owning, keeping, sheltering or harboring the animal in question shall be given
not less than 72 hours’ written notice of the time and place of the hearing.
Said notice shall set forth the description of the animal in question and the
basis for the allegation of viciousness, dangerousness or fierceness. The
notice shall also set forth that if the animal is determined to be vicious, the
owner will be required to register and restrain it in accordance with this
chapter, remove it from the city, or allow it to be destroyed. The notice shall
be served upon any adult residing at the premises where the animal is located,
or may be posted on those premises if no adult is present to accept service.
   (B)   Decision and order. If, after the hearing, the Police Chief determines
that an animal is vicious, dangerous or fierce as defined in this chapter, the

the animal to register the animal in compliance with this chapter or remove it
from the city, or to cause it to be destroyed in a humane manner. The order
shall immediately be served upon the individual or entity against whom issued
in the same manner as the notice of hearing. If the order is not complied with
in three days of its issuance, the Police Chief is authorized to order the
seizure and impoundment of the animal. An animal so seized shall be impounded
for a period of six days (not including the day of impoundment), from the date
the order is served upon the owner or keeper. If, at the end of the impoundment
period, the person against whom the order of the Police Chief was issued has

animal to be destroyed.
   (C)   Appeal to City Manager. The order to register, remove or destroy a
vicious, dangerous or fierce animal issued by the Police Chief may be appealed
to the City Manager. To appeal the order, written notice of appeal must be

remove, register or destroy the vicious animal. Failure to file such written
notice of appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal the order of
the Police Chief. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal
and shall be delivered personally or by certified mail to the City Manager. The
hearing of the appeal shall be held by the City Manager within five days after
receipt of the notice of appeal. The hearing may be continued for good cause.

complied with within three days of issuance, the City Manager is authorized to
order the seizure and impoundment of the animal. An animal so seized shall be
held impounded for a period of six days (not including the day of impoundment),
from the date the order is served upon the owner or keeper. If, at the end of
the impoundment period, the person against whom the order of the City Manager
was issued has not appealed such order to the City Council, the City Manager
shall cause the animal to be destroyed.
   (E)   Appeal to the City Council. The order to register, remove or destroy a
vicious, dangerous or fierce animal issued by the City Manager or his or her
designee may be appealed to the City Council. In order to appeal the order,
written notice of appeal must be filed with the Mayor within three days after

(Ord. 493, passed 4-18-2000)
§ 10-6-23 REGULATIONS NONEXCLUSIVE.

§ 10-6-26 CERTAIN CONDUCT IN BARS PROHIBITED.

demand for police services in and about such establishments, and finds further
that the activities commonly engaged in by both employees and patrons of such
establishments are inimical to the public welfare in that nudity in such
establishments has been demonstrated to increase the occurrence of illegal
activity in and occurring around such establishments. Accordingly, the
following acts or conduct on the premises of any bar are deemed contrary to the
public interest and welfare and the best interests of the community and,
therefor.

person on the premises to display or expose his or her genitals, pubic hair,
buttocks, anal region or any portion of the female breast at or below the
areola thereof.

on the premises to perform specified sexual activities as defined in §

above while alcoholic beverages are being sold or in the presence of anyone who

region or any portion of the female breast at or below the areola thereof on

premises at any time during the four hours immediately preceding the act or
display referred to above shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

10-8-4 Penalty
§ 10-8-1 SOLICITATION OF MOTORISTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   No person shall stand on any public or private parking lot, street or
highway, or any sidewalk or other area adjacent to any parking lot, street or
highway, and solicit or attempt to solicit employment, business or
contributions from occupants of a vehicle.

§ 10-13-1 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Prohibition Against Underage Drinking
and Social Host Liability Ordinance”.
(Ord. 560, passed 7-3-2007)
§ 10-13-2 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   Minors often obtain, possess or consume alcoholic beverages at
gatherings held at private residences or other private property, places or
premises, including rented commercial premises which are under the control of a
person who knows or should know of the consumption of alcoholic beverages by
minors yet persons responsible for the occurrence of such gatherings often fail
to take reasonable steps to prevent the consumption of alcoholic beverages by
minors at these gatherings.
   (B)   Consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors who are under the legal
age to consume alcohol in the state, is harmful to the minors themselves and
poses an immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare in that it
increases alcohol abuse by minors, physical altercations, violent crimes
including rape and other sexual offenses, accidental injury, neighborhood
vandalism and excessive noise disturbance, all of which may require
intervention by local law enforcement.
   (C)   Law enforcement responses to gatherings involving consumption of
alcoholic beverages by minors often require extensive resources to manage the
incident. Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to gatherings
involving the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors it takes away
valuable resources from other service calls in the community, thereby placing
the community at increased risk. Law enforcement, fire and emergency response
services are not currently reimbursed for the response cost associated when
called to a premises or gathering where minors obtain, possess, or consume
alcoholic beverages.

including highways is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the
value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite
plundering, creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a
harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and
general welfare.
   (B)   Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or parts thereof, on private or public property not
including highways except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is hereby
declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 167, passed 4-30-1973)

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

parts thereof declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this chapter.

(Ord. 167, passed 4-30-1973)
§ 11-6-6 ABATEMENT AND REMOVAL, PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Authority of Chief of Police. Upon discovering the existence of an
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, or parts thereof, on
private property or public property within the city, the Chief of Police shall
have the authority to cause the abatement and removal thereof in accordance
with the procedure prescribed herein.
   (B)   Notice of intention. A ten-day notice of intention to abate and remove
the vehicle, or parts thereof, as a public nuisance shall be mailed by
registered mail to the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle;
unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not
available to determine ownership.
   (C)   Public hearing.
      1.   Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or owner of the land
received by the Police Chief within ten days after the mailing of the notices
of intention to abate and remove, a public hearing shall be held by the City
Council on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle or parts
thereof as an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, and the
assessment of the administrative costs and the cost of removal of the vehicle
or parts thereof against the property on which it is located.
      2.   If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land within such
ten-day period, said statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing
which does not require his or her presence. Notice of hearing shall be mailed,
by registered mail, at least ten days before the hearing to the owner of the
land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such condition
that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. If such a
request for hearing is not received within said ten days after mailing of the
notice of intention to abate and remove, the city shall have the authority to
abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof as a public nuisance without
holding a public hearing.
   (D)   Exception. Upon discovering the existence of an abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative vehicle, or parts thereof, on public or private
property within the city which creates an immediate or imminent threat to the
safety of any individual, the Chief of Police shall have the authority to cause
the immediate abatement and removal thereof.

§ 11-6-7 HEARINGS, DETERMINATION.
   (A)   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the City Council
which shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent. Said facts and
testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or parts
thereof and the circumstances concerning its location on the said private
property or public property. The City Council shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land may appear in person at the
hearing or present a sworn written statement in time for consideration at the
hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land,
with his or her reasons for such denial.
   (B)   The City Council may impose such conditions and take such other action
as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of
this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or parts thereof
if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the
public hearing, the City Council may find that a vehicle or parts thereof have
been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or are inoperative on private or public
property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and
disposed of as hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs and
the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order
requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or parts thereof
and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if
available at the site. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was
placed on the land without the consent of the owner and that he or she has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the City Council shall not assess the
costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon
which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from
such owner of the land.
   (C)   If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land but does not
appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the City
Council but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing of the
decision.
