(Ord. 999-C-S, passed 9-10-02)
§ 1-5.05 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   (A)   A panel of at least three members of the Board of Administrative
Appeals shall constitute the "Administrative Review Panel" ("ARP"). The ARP
shall be available, at such times as the ARP shall determine, to review the
issuance of citations and the proposed imposition of administrative fines. The
ARP shall conduct an informal administrative hearing, without the use of the
formal rules of evidence, to determine whether the citation was properly issued
as a result of a code violation, whether more time should be granted for
compliance, and whether the amount of the proposed administrative fine should
be reduced or waived. At the administrative hearing, a copy of the city's
document or instrument, file, photographs, or other written material shall be
admitted as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, and it shall not
be required to have the issuing employee attend the administrative hearing. An
appellant must achieve a majority vote of the ARP members present in his or her
favor to win the appeal.
   (B)   In the case of an appeal of an administrative citation, an advance
deposit in the full amount of the fine imposed by the administrative citation
shall be submitted with the written appeal request. Upon receiving a request
for an administrative hearing, the ARP or its designee shall notify the
requesting party in writing of the time, date and place of the administrative
hearing. Such hearing may be continued from time to time for good cause but not
to exceed a maximum of 60 days from the initial hearing.
   (C)   Decisions shall be made by majority vote of the ARP, which may be
taken and announced subsequent to the hearing. The decision of the ARP shall be
final and conclusive for the city as to the imposition of the administrative
fine. The ARP or its designee shall notify the person or entity to which the
citation was issued in writing as to the decision regarding the matter,
including whether the advance deposit collected pursuant to division (B) of
this section, or a portion thereof, is forfeited as payment of the
administrative citation or all or a portion thereof will be returned, notifying
the appellant of the deadline for payment of any fine or penalty not already
collected in advance, and giving notice of the opportunity for judicial review
pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.4.
   (D)   Any person who requests an administrative review of an administrative
citation and is unable to make the advance deposit of the fine required under
division (B) of this section may file an advance deposit hardship waiver
application.
      (1)   Such hardship waiver shall be filed with the city on an advance
hardship waiver application, along with the written request for administrative
review. The city shall not grant the hardship waiver unless the party seeking
review submits a sworn declaration under penalty of perjury, together with
supporting documentation, which supports his or her financial inability to
deposit with the city the full amount of the fine in advance of the hearing.
Such documentation includes, but is not limited to, a copy of the person's
prior tax year federal or state tax returns showing adjusted gross income,
evidence he or she is currently receiving Social Security disability income
(SSI), public assistance, unemployment insurance, or similar fixed and limited
sole source income.
      (2)   The city shall issue a written determination of its reasons to
either grant or deny the hardship waiver. The written determination shall be
served on the applicant by regular first class mail at the address provided in
the hardship waiver application and such determination shall be final and not
subject to appeal.
      (3)   If the city determines that the advance deposit hardship waiver is
denied, the cited party shall remit the advance deposit to the city within
seven days of the date of the city's notice of denial of the waiver. Failure to
submit the advance deposit within the seven-day deadline shall constitute a
withdrawal of the request for administrative review.

commercial property that has an existing building at the time of the violation
and the violation is due to failure by the owner to remove visible refuse or
failure to prohibit unauthorized use of the property.
   (D)   A 10% late payment fee shall be imposed on any fine that is not paid
within 30 days of the issuance of the citation.

   Fines shall be collected by the Customer Service division of the Finance
Department and shall be credited to accounts as determined by the City Manager.
(Ord. 999-C-S, passed 9-10-02)
§ 1-5.09 COLLECTION OF UNPAID FINES AND LATE PENALTIES; SPECIAL ASSESSMENT LIEN
PROCEDURES.
   The city may collect any past due administrative citation fines or late
payment charges by use of all available legal means, including, but not limited
to, those means available for the collection of judgments, special assessment
liens and all actions for recovery of money. The city may also recover its
collection costs, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and
court costs. Special assessment liens against property shall be applied when
the administrative citation fine was issued for a violation directly connected
to conditions or activities on the subject real property.
   (A)   On a periodic basis as determined by City Manager or his or her
designee, the City Manager or his or her designee shall prepare and file with
the City Clerk a report and assessment list which identifies all real property
to which administrative citation fines have been imposed by the city pursuant
to this code and for which the owner has not fully reimbursed the city within
30 days of the date of billing. The report and assessment list shall provide a
description of the real property, the description of the code violation for
which the administrative citation fines were imposed, including any exhibits
evidencing the violation, the amount of administrative citation fines and late
penalties, and the name and address of the property owner who is entitled to
notice.
   (B)   Upon receipt of the report, the City Clerk shall post a notice of
filing of the report in a conspicuous place in the City Hall, with said notice
specifying the filing date of the report and assessment list and the time and
place when and where the report and assessment list will be submitted to the
Board of Administrative Appeals for hearing and confirmation. The City Clerk
shall also mail by regular first class mail, postage fully prepaid, a notice to
each property owner identified in the report and assessment, at the last known
address of the property owner as listed in the county tax assessors or county
property records. If, after diligent search, the owner of the property cannot
be found, the notice shall be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous
location upon the property for a period of ten days. Said notice shall provide
a description of the real property on which the violation existed, the nature
of the violation, and the amount of the fines and late penalties and shall
notify the owner that said fines and late penalties shall be assessed against
the property unless objection is made by the owner in writing and submitted to
the City Clerk at least two days before the hearing. The failure of any person
to receive notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings under this
code.
   (C)   The notice shall also specify the time and place when and where the
proposed assessment will be presented to the Board of Administrative Appeals
for hearing and confirmation.
   (D)   Any owner who objects to the proposed assessment and who desires to
challenge the proposed assessment at the hearing must submit any and all
objections in writing to the City Clerk at least three days prior to the date
of hearing. The failure of any owner to submit written objections to the City
Clerk at least three days prior to the hearing shall constitute a waiver of any
such objections and the matter may be placed on the consent calendar of the
agenda for the Board of Administrative Appeals.
   (E)   At the time and place fixed for hearing and confirming the proposed
assessments, the Board of Administrative Appeals shall consider the same. If no
objection has been submitted and the matter placed on the consent calendar,
then the Board of Administrative Appeals may make its decision on the
documentation presented. If a hearing is conducted, only those persons who have
submitted written objections to the City Clerk will be heard by the Board of
Administrative Appeals. At the hearing, the Board of Administrative Appeals may
correct, modify or eliminate any proposed assessment that the Board may deem
factually incorrect. Thereafter, the Board of Administrative Appeals shall
confirm each assessment and the amount thereof, as proposed or as corrected and
modified, and order it assessed against the property. If the Board of
Administrative Appeals orders that an assessment be assessed against the
property, they shall also direct that the same be recorded on the tax
assessment roll and thereafter the assessment shall constitute a special
assessment and lien against the property. Judicial review of the order of the
Board of Administrative Appeals may be made pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code §
53069.4.
   (F)   The special assessment lien shall be subject to the same penalties as
are provided for other delinquent taxes or assessments of the city.

   (A)   Pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 34886, Members of the City Council of
the city shall be elected by-district in four single-member districts.
      (1)   Members of the City Council shall be elected in the electoral
districts established by division (B) of this section and subsequently
reapportioned as provided by state law. Elections shall take place "by
district" as that term is defined in Cal. Gov’t Code § 34871, meaning one
Councilmember shall be elected from each district, by the voters of that
district alone.
      (2)   A Councilmember elected or appointed to represent a district must
reside in that district and be a registered voter in that district, and any
candidate for City Council must reside in, and be a registered voter in, the
district in which he or she seeks election at the time nomination papers are
issued.
   (B)   All four Councilmembers shall be elected on a "by-district" basis from
the Council districts shown and numbered on a map titled "City of Antioch
District Map," as adopted by Res. 2018/54, a copy of which shall be on file in
the City Clerk's office.
   (C)   Pursuant to Cal. Elections Code § 21601, as it may be amended from
time to time, the City Council shall adjust the boundaries of any or all of the
districts following each decennial federal census to ensure that the districts
are in compliance with all applicable provisions of law.
   (D)   District elections enacted in accordance with this section shall
commence in the November 2020 General election. In the November 2020 General
Election, Districts 1 and 4, as shown in the "City of Antioch District Map,"
will have initial terms of two years, and both districts shall again be open
for election in the November 2022 General Election, at and following which
election they shall have four year terms. Beginning in the November 2020
General Elections and thereafter, Districts 2 and 3, as shown in the "City of
Antioch District Map," shall have four year terms.
   (E)   Notwithstanding Cal. Gov’t Code § 34873, and to ensure the orderly
transition away from the at-large election system for City Councilmember that
exists at the time of this section's adoption, the two City Council positions
open for election in the November 2018 General Election shall have two year
terms and because of this reduced term of office, no Councilmember elected in
the November 2018 General Election shall have any right or claim under Cal.
Gov’t Code § 34873 to any term of office longer than two years.

§ 2-1.602 APPOINTMENT.
   Following the initial appointment of standby council members, standby
members shall be appointed at the first regular Council meeting following the
swearing-in of newly-elected members, and at such other times as are deemed
appropriate. Each Council member shall nominate three standby members, and
shall indicate the order of priority of each standby member. Consideration
shall be given to places of residence and work, so that the greatest
probability of survivorship or availability shall exist. While not required,
priority shall be given to city residents who are at least 18 years of age and
are registered voters. The City Council shall then appoint the nominees as
standby council members.
(Ord. 909-C-S, passed 9-12-95)
§ 2-1.603 SERVICE OF STANDBY COUNCIL MEMBERS.
   Standby council members may become activated during a state of war
emergency, a state of emergency or a declared local emergency. No standby
member shall become a member of the City Council unless there is a declared
emergency described above. The mere vacancy of the regular Council member's
office absent a declared emergency shall not activate the standby member. The
first priority standby member shall serve during the emergency if his or her
regular member is unavailable, meaning that the regular member is killed,
missing, or so seriously injured as to be unable to attend meetings and
otherwise perform duties. Any question as to whether a particular member is
unavailable shall be settled by the remaining available members of the Council,
including standby officers who are serving. If the first priority standby
member is unavailable, the second priority shall serve, and so forth. Standby
members shall serve at the pleasure of the governing body appointing them, and
may be removed and replaced at any time with or without cause.
(Ord. 909-C-S, passed 9-12-95)
§ 2-1.604 FILLING OF OFFICES.
   Upon standby members becoming activated, the City Council shall, if
necessary, determine offices. In the event that both the Mayor and Mayor Pro
Tempore shall be unavailable, then the remaining regular members of the Council
shall determine the Temporary Presiding Officer as determined by §
2-1.501. No standby member shall become Mayor or Temporary Presiding Officer if
any of the regular Council members are available to fill such position,
although the standby member shall continue to serve as a member of the
governing body until the termination of the emergency, until the regular member
becomes available, or until the regular member is replaced pursuant to
provisions of state law.
(Ord. 909-C-S, passed 9-12-95)

§ 3-1.117 SEPARATE LICENSES; MORE THAN ONE BUSINESS; EXCEPTIONS.
   Separate licenses shall be obtained for each kind or class of business
carried on at a location; provided, however, any person carrying on a business
at one location containing several departments, all of which are presided over
and carried on exclusively by such person as proprietor or by members of his or
her immediate family (parents, spouse, or children) need pay only one license
tax which shall be the full license tax of whichever business activity is
subject to the highest license tax under this chapter.
(Ord. 2082-C-S, passed 3-25-14)

   (A)   Generally. Except as otherwise provided in division (E) of this
section, when an applicant submits a timely business license renewal, the Tax
Administrator or his or her designee shall renew the license effective the
first day of the month following the expiration date.
   (B)   Renewal application deadlines. Every person desiring to continue in
business after the expiration of a license shall apply for renewal not less
than 30 days after expiration of the license. In the case of a business
activity having a fixed location, a license for a different location shall be
reviewed as a new application rather than as a renewal.
   (C)   Conduct of business after expiration of license. In recognition of the
fact that applications for renewal of a business license are submitted after
the expiration date the 30 day renewal grace period is from the expiration date
in which to renew without penalties.
   (D)   Late application. Failure to file an application to renew a business
license within the 30 days permitted by §
3-1.120 is a violation of this Code punishable as set forth in
Chapter 2 of Title 1. However, a licensee may submit a late application which
shall be processed with appropriate delinquent penalties assessed after 30, 60
and 90 days. The city does not honor post mark dates; an application is
considered received when physically delivered to City Hall.
   (E)   Imposition of conditions on renewal/hearings.  Upon 30 days' written
notice to a licensee, the Tax Administrator or his or her designee may impose
conditions on renewal of a license as may be required to ensure the business
operates consistently with the requirements of this Code and the public health,
safety and welfare provided, however, that conditions limiting hours of
operation must be approved by the City Manager.
   (F)   Appeal of conditions of renewal. Any person aggrieved by the
imposition of conditions on a renewal may request review by the City Manager by
a writing submitted to the City Clerk within 30 days of the decision to be
reviewed.
   (G)   Associated fees. No license shall be renewed unless all other city
fees and taxes owed by the applicant are paid in full.
   (H)   Refunds. Payment of business license is final and non refundable for
any reason except as specified in §
3-1.116.
(Ord. 2082-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 3-1.121 TRANSFERS AND CHANGES.
   (A)   Transfers of ownership. A new business license is required upon a
transfer in ownership of a business required to have a license pursuant to this
chapter. The new license shall be issued upon: (i) the filing of a complete
application and the payment of all required fees and tax; (ii) a finding that
there has been no change in the location, nature or scope of business; and
(iii) a finding that the previous owner has a valid business license at the
time of transfer. However, if the original business license application
required the business owner or manager to be fingerprinted and/or subject to a
background investigation, then the new business owner or manager must also be
fingerprinted and the new license shall be subject to a background
investigation. The following shall be considered transfers of licensed
businesses subject to this division (A):
      (1)   The addition or withdrawal of a partner or partners;
      (2)   The transfer of a business from one partnership to another;
      (3)   The transfer of a business from a partnership to a corporation;

or vice versa, unless the corporation's sole shareholder and the natural person
are the same;
      (7)   The transfer of a business from a partnership to a natural person,
or vice versa; or
      (8)   The transfer of a majority share of stock in a corporation in one
or more transactions within 12 months.
   (B)   Change of name or contact information. Whenever a business required to
be licensed pursuant to this chapter changes its name, contact information or
mailing address, a business license change form is required, along with payment
of an application fee pursuant to §
3-1.112. The tax imposed under Article 2 of this chapter shall not be imposed
with respect to the issuance of such a new license. If the changes are in
conjunction with and during the renewal period, then an additional application
fee is not charged unless payment is delinquent.
   (C)   Change of location. Whenever a business required to be licensed
pursuant to this chapter changes its business location, a new business license
application is required, along with the payment of an application fee pursuant
to §
3-1.112. The tax imposed under Article 2 of this chapter shall not be imposed
with respect to the issuance of such a new license. If the changes are in
conjunction with and during the renewal period, then an additional application
fee is not charged unless payment is delinquent.
   (D)   Change in business. Whenever a business required to be licensed
pursuant to this chapter changes the nature or scope of the business a new
business license application is required, along with the payment of an
application fee pursuant to §
3-1.112. The tax imposed under Article 2 of this chapter shall not be imposed
with respect to the issuance of such a new license. If the changes are in
conjunction with and during the renewal period, then an additional application
fee is not charged unless payment is delinquent.
   (E)   Termination/closures in business. Businesses must notify the city of
the termination or closure of the business in writing and surrender the
business license certificate or all fees shall be due and retroactively
collected and subject to late penalties. Surrender of the business license
certificate terminates business tax liability except for prior amounts due.
Failure to surrender the business license certificate is prima facie evidence
that the business has been operating.
(Ord. 2082-C-S, passed 3-25-14)

   (A)   The Tax Administrator or his or her designee may suspend or revoke a

record of his or her decision that one or more of the following conditions
exist:
      (1)   For businesses involving First Amendment activities.

violated applicable law in the exercise of any rights granted by the license;

bears a substantial relationship to the conduct of the licensed business
activity;
         (c)   That the licensee has been held liable for or convicted of any

any rights permitted by the license, including but not limited to the issuance
of an administrative citation unless that citation is determined to be
unfounded by a court of competent jurisdiction;
         (d)   That the licensee, licensee's employees, agents or manager, has
violated any rule or regulation of any governmental agency relating to the
licensed business;
         (e)   That the licensee has conducted the licensed business in a

(Ord. 2082-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 3-1.124 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL. 
   (A)   Authority to condition license. The Tax Administrator or his or her
designee may condition any business license if he or she finds on the basis of
substantial evidence in the record of the decision that grounds for denial or
revocation of a business license exist including, but not limited to, a finding
that business has been conducted or operated in a manner detrimental to the
public health, safety and general welfare in that:
      (1)   The licensee, the licensee's agent, manager or employees have
failed to maintain the premises in a neat and clean condition and have allowed
the business premises to deteriorate and become blighted;
      (2)   The licensee, the licensee's agent, manager or employees have
allowed or failed to take reasonable steps to discourage unlawful activity on
or immediately adjacent to the business premises; or
      (3)   The licensee, the licensee's agent, manager or employees have
failed to provide adequate parking to serve the volume of patrons it generates
or otherwise caused traffic-related noise and disturbances.
   (B)   Application to change conditions. The Tax Administrator or his or her
designee may change, modify or eliminate conditions on a license upon written
request of the licensee if he or she finds that the reasons for the conditions
have been cured.
   (C)   Consent to right of entry. If the Tax Administrator or his or her
designee finds that unannounced inspections of the business premises are
necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter, it may impose as a
condition of the license that the applicant or licensee consent to entry of the
applicant's or licensee's place of business at all reasonable times by any city
officer or employee authorized to enforce the provisions of this Code. Upon
presentation of proper credentials by any such officer or employee, the
applicant or licensee shall comply with such inspection. Nothing in this
division is intended to limit the power of the Tax Administrator, or his or her
designee city officers, or employees to enter any place held open to the public
or otherwise to create a reasonable expectation of privacy.
   (D)   Noise abatement. Whenever the Tax Administrator or his or her designee
determines that noise from any business licensed under this chapter interferes
with the right of neighbors to the peaceful and quiet use and enjoyment of
property, or has violated
Chapter 17 of Title 5 (Disturbing the Peace) of this Code, the Tax
Administrator or his or her designee may require the licensed premises to be
soundproofed or that the licensee take other steps to reduce noise to a
reasonable level. The Tax Administrator or his or her designee shall balance
the interests of all affected parties with any hardship which will result from
the order. The Tax Administrator or his or her designee may rely on substantial
evidence, including, but not limited to that, provided by other city employees
and officers.
(Ord. 2082-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 3-1.125 PERMITS REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES.
   (A)   No license shall be issued before any land use approval under the

Municipal Code pursuant to the city's police power is granted. Such permits
include but are not limited to massage establishments, computer gaming and
internet access businesses, taxis/limousines, and card rooms.

sparring exhibition, sideshow, dance hall, skating rink, bowling lane,
amusement or recreation parlor or place of any description, or similar
enterprise until the applicant has applied for a permit to be issued by the
city. The city may deny any such application if he or she determines that the
granting of the permit will be contrary to the preservation of the public
peace, health safety, or general welfare. The city may approve such a permit on
such terms, conditions, and restrictions upon the operation, management, and
conduct of such business, not in conflict with any applicable law, as he or she
may deem necessary or expedient to protect the public peace, health, safety, or
general welfare. In addition to the permit required by this section, the
applicant shall obtain a business license authorizing such uses from the Tax
Administrator or his or her designee, and shall pay the fees and taxes required
by this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all permits
shall be issued for one year and must be renewed annually.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for the holder of any such permit or land use
entitlement to violate or permit the violation of any of the terms, conditions,
and restrictions imposed upon the issuance of such permit or entitlement.

shall otherwise violate any of the provision of this chapter, shall be
punishable pursuant to §§
1-2.01 et seq. of this Code.
   (B)   The conviction and punishment of any person having engaged in business
without a license shall not excuse or exempt the person from the payment of any
license tax due or unpaid at the time of the conviction, and nothing in this
chapter shall prevent criminal prosecution for any violation of any provision
of this chapter.
(Ord. 2082-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 3-1.127 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   (A)   The books and records of every licensee or applicant for license shall
be subject to audit and verification by the Tax Administrator, or his or her
designee or authorized employees of the city, who are hereby authorized to
examine, audit, and inspect the books and records of any licensee or applicant
for license as may be necessary in their judgment to verify or ascertain the
amount of business license tax due.
   (B)   All persons subject to the provisions of this chapter shall keep
complete records of business transactions, including sales, receipts,
purchases, and other expenditures, and shall retain all such records for
examination by the tax for at least three years. Refusal to allow authorized
representatives of the Tax Administrator or his or her designee to examine
books and records at reasonable times and places shall constitute a violation
of this Code and shall be sufficient grounds to refuse issuance, renewal or the
continuing effectiveness of a business license.
   (C)   The information furnished or secured pursuant to this chapter shall be
confidential, and any unauthorized disclosure or use of such information by any
officer or employee of the city shall be punishable pursuant to § 1-2.01 of

§ 3-1.129 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   No undue burden. None of the license taxes provided for by this
chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate
commerce or to violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the
Constitutions of the United States and the State of California.
   (B)   Exemptions as matter of law. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any business
exempt by virtue of the Constitution or applicable statutes of the United
States or of the State of California from the payment of such taxes as are
prescribed in this chapter.
   (C)   Intent. This chapter is intended to impose a tax for revenue purposes
on those engaged in business activity in the city to the full extent of the
city’s authority to do so, but not to exceed the city’s authority or to violate
the rights of taxpayers under applicable law. This chapter shall be construed
in light of this intent.
(Ord. 2092-C-S, passed 8-12-14)
§ 3-1.130 REFUNDS.
   No tax shall be refunded unless it is determined by the Tax Administrator
that a tax has been paid in error, computed incorrectly, overpaid, or collected
illegally. No refund shall be made unless a request is received by the Tax
Administrator within one year of the payment of the tax.
(Ord. 2092-C-S, passed 8-12-14)
§ 3-1.131 AUDITS AND ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Any person engaged in a business taxed under this chapter shall
maintain and preserve, for a period of at least two years, suitable records as
may be necessary to determine the amount of the tax due under this chapter and
shall, upon request of the Tax Administrator, provide the necessary records to
substantiate the tax paid or due for such business. If upon audit of such
records, the Tax Administrator determines the tax imposed by this chapter has
not been paid in full, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer of the
balance due, including any accrued penalties. Such amount shall be paid within
90 days after notice is issued by the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   If an audit reveals an overpayment, the Tax Administrator shall notify
the taxpayer of the amount overpaid. Unless the taxpayer requests a refund of
the overpayment within 30 days after notice is issued by the Tax Administrator,
the overpayment shall be applied as a credit against the next tax due.
   (C)   If an audit reveals an underpayment of $25 or less, the Tax
Administrator shall take no action to collect the underpayment.
   (D)   Rather than request information and conduct an audit, the Tax
Administrator may request an applicant to file a corrected application for tax
certificate. If such an application is filed and the Tax Administrator is
satisfied with its accuracy, the existence of any underpayment or overpayment
under this section shall be determined with reference to that corrected
application. If a taxpayer fails to file a corrected application or if the Tax
Administrator is not satisfied with a corrected application, the Tax
Administrator may conduct an audit under division (A) of this section.

address of which the Tax Administrator has been informed.

section. In the event an aggrieved person timely requests a hearing, a public
hearing will be noticed to affected property owners and the developer and
conducted by the Tax Administrator or his or her designee within 30 days of
such request, at which time any aggrieved person may present evidence to
contest the lien. The Tax Administrator or his or her designee shall determine
the developer's obligation to pay the business license tax and the amount of
the business license tax owed and give notice of that decision at least five
days before recording the lien.
   (E)   Filling notices of liens. The Tax Administrator or his or her designee
upon the determination that the business license tax is due, shall record a
notice of lien in substantially the following form:

provided by law for the failure to pay a business license tax and shall also be
cumulative, both with regard to each remedy provided by this chapter and each
remedy provided by law.
   (G)   Tax refund. If the condominium conversion project is never consummated
by sale of a unit, the person paying the business license tax shall be entitled
to a refund of tax upon the filing of a new map, reversion to acreage or other
lawful means to terminate the condominium status of the property. The city
shall make the refund within 30 days of adoption of a budget for the fiscal
year commencing the filing with the Tax Administrator or his or her designee of

Administrator or his or her designee shall annually apply the CPI factor and
calculate all fees and taxes due under this chapter and shall give notice of
those calculations in the manner required by law for ordinances of the City
Council. The City Council may, but need not, direct the Tax Administrator or
his or her designee to forebear from collecting the entire amount of fees and
taxes as adjusted for inflation under this section in one or more fiscal years,
but any such forbearance may terminate when the Council directs without

3-4.02.

contractors and consultants in a fair manner; to eliminate favoritism, fraud
and corruption in the awarding of public contracts; and to comply with

sources for the procurement. In unique situations, the City Manager and City
Attorney may determine in writing that these goals would not be met by engaging
in the bidding procedures outlined in this chapter.

may re-evaluate its cost estimates of the project and take such actions allowed
by law including:
      (1)   Abandon the project;
      (2)   Re-advertise for bids; or
      (3)   Have the project done by force account without further complying
with this chapter. In electing this option, the City Council shall first adopt
a resolution by a four-fifths vote, declaring that the project can be performed
more economically by the employees of the city.

adopting plans, specifications, strain sheets, or working details, or giving
notice for bids to let contracts. The work may be done by day labor under the
direction of the Director, by contractor, or by a combination of the two. In

with the procedures in Cal. Pub. Cont. Code § 22050 (Emergency Contracting
Procedures).
   (B)   (1)   The City Council delegates its authority under Cal. Pub. Cont.
Code § 22050 to the City Manager, so that before any emergency action is taken,
that the City Manager will make a finding based on substantial evidence that:

competitive solicitation for bids; and
         (b)   The action is necessary to respond to the emergency.
      (2)   The City Manager shall report to the City Council at its next

   The Council hereby declares that the provisions of this article are adopted

of this article be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   (A)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which complies with the requirements
and limitations contained in Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code Part 1.5 of Division 2;
   (B)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code Part 1.5 of Division 2;
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which imposes a tax and provides a
measure therefor which can be administered and collected by the State Board of
Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the sales and use taxes of the state; and
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which can be administered in a manner
that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Cal. Rev.
and Tax. Code Part 1.5 of Division 2, minimize the cost of collecting city
sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping
upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this article.
('66 Code, § 3-5.204) (Ord. 232-C-S, passed 11-8-73)
§ 3-5.205 CONTRACT WITH STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.
   Prior to the operative date of this article, the city shall contract with
the State Board of Equalization to perform all the functions incident to the
administra-tion and operation of this sales and use tax law. If the city shall
not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to such
operative date, the city shall nevertheless so contract and, in such a case,
the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter
following the execution of such contract rather than the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the adoption of this article.
('66 Code, § 3-5.205) (Ord. 232-C-S, passed 11-8-73)
§ 3-5.206 SALES TAXES.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate set forth in §
3-5.202 of this article of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of
all tangible personal property sold at retail in the city on and after the
operative date of this article.
('66 Code, § 3-5.206) (Ord. 232-C-S, passed 11-8-73)
§ 3-5.207 PLACE OF SALE.
   For the purposes of this article, all retail sales are consummated at the
place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out of state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out of state destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is
made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state
or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail
sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be
prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
('66 Code, § 3-5.207) (Ord. 232-C-S, passed 11-8-73)
§ 3-5.208 USE TAXES.
   An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in
the city of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after
the operative date of this chapter for storage, use or other consumption in the
city at the rate set forth in §
3-5.202 of this article of the sales price of the property. The sales price
shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or
use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.
('66 Code, § 3-5.208) (Ord. 232-C-S, passed 11-8-73)
§ 3-5.209 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW PROVISIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in this article, and except insofar as they are
inconsistent with the provisions of Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code Part 1.5 of
Division 2, all of the provisions of Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code Part 1 of Division
2 are hereby adopted and made a part of this article as though fully set forth
in this article.
('66 Code, § 3-5.209) (Ord. 232-C-S, passed 11-8-73)
§ 3-5.210 LIMITATIONS ON ADOPTION OF STATE LAW PROVISIONS.
   In adopting the provisions of Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code Part 1 of Division 2,
wherever the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of
the city shall be substituted therefor. Such substitution, however, shall not
be made when the word “state” is used as part of the title of the State
Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of
Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State. Such
substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would
require action to be taken by or against the city, or any agency thereof,
rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the
functions incident to the administra-tion or operation of the provisions of
this article. Such substitution shall not be made in those sections, including,
but not necessarily limited to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of
the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an
exemption from the tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use, or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt
from this tax while such sales, storage, use, or other consumption remains

   For the purpose of this article, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, or
intended or designed for occupancy, by transients for dwelling, lodging, or
sleeping purposes and shall include any hotel, inn, tourist home or house,
motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment
house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a
fixed location, or other similar structure, or portion thereof.

any room, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping
purposes.
   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this article and shall have the
same duties and  liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions
of this article by either the principal or the managing agent, however, shall
be considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.

of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, property, and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR. The Director of Finance of the city.
   TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for
a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar
days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be
deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there
is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for
a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date of the provisions of this article may be considered.

§ 3-5.303 TAX IMPOSED.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel or motel, each person shall be
subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the
operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed to the city, which debt shall
be extinguished only by payment to the operator and thence to the city. The
occupant shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or motel at the time
the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of
the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon
the occupant's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel or motel.

pastries, cereals, fruit, and beverages, an amount of five dollars per room per
night may be so deducted.
      (3)   When a made-to-order hot breakfast is provided, an amount of ten
dollars per room per night may be so deducted.
   (B)   The operator may apply for permission from the Tax Administrator to
deduct higher amounts for food and/or beverages provided, and the Administrator
shall approve such deductions, upon a showing that the operator's reasonably
imputed value for the food and/or beverage is higher than the amounts specified
in this section for flat deductions. The reasonableness of the imputed value
may be determined by the operator's actual costs, reasonable overhead and
profit.

§ 3-5.309 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION BY TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within
the time provided in this article, any report and remittance of such tax, or
any portion thereof, required by the provisions of this article, the Tax
Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain the
facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as
the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to
obtain upon which to base the assessment of any such tax imposed by the
provisions of this article and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Tax
Administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest, and penalties provided for by the provisions of this article. In
the event such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give notice
of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States Mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
his last known place of address. Such operator may, within 10 days after the
service or mailing of such notice, make an application in writing to the Tax
Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such an
application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five days'
written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show
cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein
should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing the
operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and
penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator
shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such
determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is filed
as provided in §
3-5.310 of this article.

   The tax established by this article shall run with the business and any
successor operator shall be responsible and liable for payment of any unpaid
transient occupancy taxes attributable to the business prior to transfer of
ownership, unless the successor operator has applied to the Tax Administrator
for a tax clearance certificate pursuant to Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code § 7283.5
and has received from the Administrator a certificate indicating that no tax is
due, owing, delinquent or attributable to the business prior to transfer of
ownership.

to the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days after
the service or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Council shall
fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give
notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The
findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed in this article for the service of a
notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.

to the city of any tax imposed by the provisions of this article to keep and
preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to
determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection

overpaid, or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city pursuant to the provisions of this article, such amount
may be refunded as provided in divisions (B) and (C) of this section provided a
claim in writing, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon
which the claim is founded, is filed in accordance with
Chapter 13 of Title 3 of the Antioch Municipal Code with the exception that the
claim is filed with the Tax Administrator instead of the City Clerk.
   (B)   Any operator may claim a refund when it has established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however that a refund shall not be
allowed unless the amount of the tax has been refunded to the transient or
credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than
once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in division (A) of this section but only when the
tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator or when the
transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid pursuant to the provisions in this section
unless the claimant establishes his or her right by written records.
   (E)   No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for recovery of
any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally determined or
collected unless a claim for each refund has been filed pursuant to this
section.

shall issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against the city or
any officer of the city, to prevent or enjoin collection of taxes sought to be

penalties shall be required as a condition precedent to seeking judicial review
of any tax liability.

§ 3-8.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “New Area Development Tax Law” of the
city.
('66 Code, § 3-8.01) (Ord. 542-C-S, passed 2-24-83)
§ 3-8.02 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The Council finds that a number of municipal services are required when
property is annexed to the city for residential development. Frequently, a full
level of service is required before the city realizes the full benefit of
property taxes from the area. This is because a substantial period of time
usually elapses between the construction of infrastructure and eventual sale of
homes to consumers and before the receipt of taxes on the full value of the
homes. During this time the city must provide the full range of municipal
services to the area, and the level of property taxes received during this time
is insufficient to fund such services. The new area development tax is
therefore imposed to avoid a drain on the city's finances during such
circumstances. The Council finds that failure to impose such tax would place
the residents of the subdivisions in question, or of the immediate community,
or both, in a condition perilous to their health and safety.
('66 Code, § 3-8.02) (Ord. 542-C-S, passed 2-24-83)
§ 3-8.03 ALTERNATIVE TO ANNEXATION FEES.
   The new area development tax shall be an alternative to the annexation fees
established by Resolution No. 82/43. A developer, at his option, may pay either
the annexation fee as established by said resolution or the new area
development tax. However, it is mandatory that either said tax or said
annexation fee be paid. If the developer pays said tax, he shall receive a
credit for moneys paid pursuant to Resolution No. 82/43.
('66 Code, § 3-8.03) (Ord. 542-C-S, passed 2-24-83)
§ 3-8.04 APPLICABILITY.
   The new area development tax shall be applicable to property which had not
been recorded for annexa-tion on or before August 5, 1982. Recognizing that
commercial and industrial development generates revenue to the city in addition
to property taxes, such as the sales tax and other levies, the new area
development tax shall be applicable only to residential development.
('66 Code, § 3-8.04) (Ord. 542-C-S, passed 2-24-83)
§ 3-8.05 AMOUNT OF TAX.
   (A)   The new area development tax shall be paid as follows:
      (1)   Per gross acre prior to the recordation of annexation, $100; and
      (2)   Per dwelling unit prior to the city approval of final subdivision
maps, use permits, or any other land entitlement, $120.
   (B)   The amount of tax shall escalate each July 1, beginning the first full
year after the adoption of this chapter, at the rate of the Consumers Price
Index for the San Francisco Bay Area, as calculated by the Finance Department.
('66 Code, § 3-8.05) (Ord. 542-C-S, passed 2-24-83)
§ 3-8.06 COLLECTION.
   If for any reason a court of competent juris-diction finds the point of
collection to be invalid or unenforceable, the new area development tax shall
be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit or at such other point which
is approved by the court. If for any reason the portion of the tax based upon
acreage is found invalid or unenforceable, the base rate of the tax shall be
$140 per dwelling unit.
('66 Code, § 3-8.06) (Ord. 542-C-S, passed 2-24-83)
§ 3-8.07 USE OF PROCEEDS.
   The new area development tax is imposed for revenue-raising purposes. The
proceeds shall be placed into the General Fund for general govern-mental
purposes and operations.

§ 3-9.01 FINDINGS.
   The City Council of the city hereby finds the following to be true and
correct:
   (A)   Effective August 9, 1994, the Cities of Antioch, Brentwood, and
Pittsburg, together with the County of Contra Costa, entered into an Agreement
pursuant to California Government Code Section 6500 et seq., entitled "East
Contra Costa Regional Fee and Financing Authority Joint Exercise of Powers
Agreement" (referred to as the "Agreement"), which provided for the creation of
a separate Joint Powers Agency ("ECCRFFA" or "Authority"), to assist in the
establishment of a Uniform Regional Development Fee Program and the funding and
implementation of transportation improvement projects in the East County area.
The ECCRFFA area of jurisdiction is defined as "Region" in the Agreement. With
the incorporation of the City of Oakley, effective July 1, 1999, the Parties
amended the Agreement to add Oakley as an additional member of the ECCRFFA,
pursuant to Sections 3C and 16 of the Agreement, effective October 4, 1999. The
four cities listed above and the County are the "Member Agencies" of ECCRFFA.
   (B)   Pursuant to the Agreement, ECCRFFA has established its
purposes—namely:
      (1)   To establish a Uniform Regional Development Fee Program ("Fee
Program") within the region, and to coordinate planning and implementation of
the Fee Program within a single public agency.
      (2)   To identify projects to be funded by the fee program solely or in
conjunction with other funding sources.
      (3)   To establish funding goals for identified projects, and to seek
commitments from the parties to this agreement regarding funding for the
projects.
      (4)   To establish an implementation schedule for projects.
      (5)   To establish fee collection, financing, and management mechanisms,
and to formalize institutional arrangements for the implementation of the fee
program.
   (C)    Pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, California Government Code
Section 66000, et seq., a local agency is authorized to charge a fee to
development applicants in connection with approval of a development project for
the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the costs of public facilities
related to the development project.
   (D)    In furtherance of the its purposes and goals, ECCRFFA undertook the
conduct of studies and the preparation and approval of reports, commencing with
the "Development Program Report for the Eastern Contra Costa Sub Regional
Transportation Mitigation Fee", prepared by and for the Contra Costa Public
Works Department dated March 8, 1994.
   (E)   In 2001, ECCRFFA initiated a comprehensive update of the Program to
help fund additional regional transportation improvements. That update, which
was documented in a report entitled "East Contra Costa Fee Program Update",
prepared by ECCRFFA's consultants (Fehr and Peers), dated May, 2001, included a
list of capital improvement projects and an updated fee structure for new
development. The update was not formally approved by ECCRFFA, but a modified
report, the "East County Transportation Improvement Authority Fee Study",
addressing similar transportation needs, facilities, costs, and fees, was
approved by each of the four members (Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, and the
County) pursuant to a new and separate Joint Powers Authority known as the East
County Transportation Improvement Authority ("ECTIA"), in January 2002.
   (F)   From 1994 to date, ECCRFFA and its member agencies have used several
different, but synonymous names to refer to the ECCRFFA developer fees for
mitigation of transportation congestion and related impacts.
   (G)   In recognition of continuing growth and development in the areas of
each of the member agencies, the ECCRFFA staff and Board of Directors
determined that a further updating of all relevant data was appropriate,
including the adoption, if necessary, of a revised and increased capital
improvement plan and including Regional Transportation-Development Impact
Mitigation Fees, hereinafter referred to as "RTDIM Fees", by each of the
ECCRFFA Member Agencies.
   (H)   The initiative to update the fee program was discussed at public
meetings of the ECCRFFA Board in the fall of 2003, and ECCRFFA contracted with
Fehr & Peers, Transportation Consultants, on November 1, 2003, to prepare a
detailed "East Contra Costa Regional Fee Program Update Report" ("Report"). The
draft of the report dated June, 2005, has been completed and submitted to the
Board of Directors for review and consideration.
   (I)   In the course of the study process and preparing the report,
information and input was obtained from the Transplan technical Advisory
Committee, the lead engineers from each Member City and the County of Contra
Costa, the Executive Committee comprised of the City Managers of each Member
City and the Chief Administrative Office of the County, as well as the County
Counsel's office.
   (J)   In the course of the study, in discussions with the Advisory Committee
and staff, and in the preparation of the Report, the contract Consultants
referred to and utilized numerous professional and industry related
publications, including but not limited to:
      (1)   Response to Proposed Route 4 Bypass Authority Development Fee
Program, Korve Engineering, April 1993.
      (2)   Brief Guide of Vehicular Traffic Generation rates, San Diego
Association of Governments, July 1998.
      (3)   Route 4 East Corridor Major Investment Study, Contra Costa
Transportation Authority, May 1999.
      (4)   Projections 2000, Association of Bay Area Governments, 2000.
      (5)   East County Transportation Improvement Authority Fee Study, Final
Report Fehr & Peers Associates, January 2002.
      (6)   SR 4 East Corridor Transit Study, Contra Costa Transportation
Authority, December 2002.
      (7)   Trip Generation, 7th Edition, Institute of Transportation
Engineers, 2003.
      (8)   Traffic Service Objectives Monitoring Report, Contra Costa
Transportation Authority, December 2004.
      (9)   Action Plans for the Routes of Regional Significance,
Transportation Planning Committee for East County.
      (10)   East County Travel Demand Model, a computer program of the Contra
Costa Transportation Authority.
      (11)   These documents have been presented to the city and were available
to all interested persons.
   (K)   In the course of the study and as one basis for the findings,
conclusions, and recommendations in the report, the contract consultants
reviewed regional land use forecasts provided by the Association of Bay Area
Governments ("ABAG"), and the General Plans of each of the ECCRFFA Member
Agencies reflecting land use projections, including future population and
employment growth.
   (L)   The report establishes that projected new development in the Cities of
Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, and Pittsburg and the unincorporated eastern
portion of the County of Contra Costa will further congest the freeways and
arterial roadways and place additional demand on the regional transportation
system.
   (M)   Future development in the service area of ECCRFFA will generate the
need for the additional regional traffic improvements specified in the report,
and that these regional traffic improvements are consistent with the general
plans of the member agencies.
   (N)   Travelers on some of the regional transportation facilities described
in Table 3 of the report, currently experience congestion and delays which are
expected to increase in severity as the result of projected development.
Expansion and construction of related improvements to the identified
transportation facilities will increase the flow of traffic, reduce congestion
and noise, and improve safety and air quality throughout the regional area.
Based upon this data, the City Council finds that there is a reasonable
relationship between the need for the expansion and other transportation
improvements to the identified transportation facilities projects and to the
types of development on which the fee is imposed.
   (O)   The report finds that a total of 26 regional traffic/transportation
projects are necessary to accommodate future growth and its associated traffic
demand. The specific transportation improvements to be financed by the fees are
described in Table 3 of the Report which is deemed to be the capital
improvement plan of ECCRFFA.
   (P)   The estimated costs of the capital improvements, the continued need
for those improvements, and the reasonable relationship between such need and
the impacts of the various types of development pending or anticipated and for
which the fee is charged, were studied and reviewed as a part of the report
project.
   (Q)   The regional traffic/transportation projects are necessary for the
safety and capacity of the transportation system as determined by planned
growth forecasted by ABAG for the agencies participating in the agreement
relating to the ECCRFFA.
   (R)   The projects will be funded by RTDIM Fees uniformly assessed over the
entire east county region on a per dwelling unit or per square foot of gross
floor area basis. The fee-funded portion of the cost of the projects has been
distributed between the individual land use categories based on a peak hour
trip generation factor, all as specified in the report. The fees are also
calculated in the report.
   (S)   The purpose of this fee program is to generate monies that will fund
the projects. The projects will improve safety and provide additional
transportation capacity. In this way, the transportation system can keep pace
with the planned growth in the areas of each of the member agencies by
providing assistance for the transportation needs and improved infrastructure
contained in the general plans of the member agencies.
   (T)   The RTDIM Fees will enable the ECCRFFA to construct and to provide
regional traffic improvements and to provide road and transportation facilities
to meet the needs of new residents and employees in the communities served by
the ECCRFFA.
   (U)   Adoption of increased RTDIM fees, together with other sources of
revenue, will provide for the implementation of a transportation system that
provides access to the major developed areas of East County and maintains
acceptable travel conditions on the regional roadway and freeway system.
   (V)   The RTDIM fees will be used to pay for administration of the fee area
and for the planning, environmental documentation, design, acquisition of
right-of-way, and construction of the projects.
   (W)   Revenues received from RTDIM fees imposed by the member agencies and
transmitted to ECCRFFA at the current rates are not sufficient to meet the
funding needs for the regional traffic/transportation projects identified in
the project list, Table 3 of the report.
   (X)   That the cost estimates set forth in Table 3 of the Report are
reasonable cost estimates for constructing the projects, and the fees expected
to be generated by future developments will not exceed the total costs of
constructing the regional traffic improvements. There is a reasonable
relationship between the amount of the RTDIM Fees set forth in Exhibit "A" and
the cost of the public facility or portion of the public facility attributable
to the development on which the fee is imposed.
   (Y)   The report establishes, by use of a six-step technical analysis, that
ECCRFFA-wide uniform RTDIM Fees are justified as being reasonably related to
the types of development on which the fees are to be imposed, and that there is
a reasonable relationship between the need for the facilities described in
Table 3 of the report and the types of development on which the fees are
imposed, i.e., single family, multiple family, commercial, office, industrial,
and other uses. The method of allocation of the fee schedule in Exhibit "A" to
a particular development within a class, bears a fair and reasonable
relationship to each development's burden on, and benefit from the regional
transportation improvements to be funded by the fees.
   (Z)   There is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the type
of development projects on which the fees are imposed, in that the types of
development subject to the fees will generate additional traffic which will
place additional demand on the regional transportation system. The additional
traffic generated by the development projects will result in a need to expand,
extend, or improve existing transportation facilities and a need to construct
new facilities to mitigate the adverse traffic effects that would otherwise
result from such development. Construction of the improvements specified in the
report will result in improved traffic flow, reduced congestion and noise, and
improved safety and air quality in the study area.
   (AA)   The fees collected pursuant to the adopted ordinances or resolutions
of the member agencies will be used for transportation improvements that will
mitigate impacts and reduce traffic congestion and delays, and improve noise,
safety and air quality through the regional area, and the City Council finds
that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the RTDIM Fees
(transportation improvements) and the type of development projects upon which
the fees are imposed.
   (BB)   The City Council determines that the adoption of the RTDIM Fees
resolution is statutorily exempt from the requirements of the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to Section 21080(b)(8) of the
Public Resources Code and Section 15273(a)(4) of the CEQA Guidelines because
the fees collected from this action will be used for transportation
infrastructure necessary to maintain an acceptable level of service within
existing service areas. Once sufficient funds are collected and prior to
approval of the final alignment and configuration of the individual
transportation improvement projects, ECCRFFA or the affected member agencies
must comply with CEQA.
(Ord. 1054-C-S, passed 8-9-05)
§ 3-9.02 ADOPTION OF FEE.
   (A)   The report and the referenced publications contain sufficient
information for the Council to make the above findings, and the Council
declares that it has relied thereon in reaching its conclusions and
recommendations set forth herein.
   (B)   After considering the studies and analyses prepared by ECCRFFA's
consultants and staff as reflected in the report, together with the testimony
received at the public hearing, the City Council approves and adopts said
report as the final report, and incorporates the report by reference and makes
it a part of this chapter. The final report is ordered to be kept on file with
the City Clerk.
   (C)   The RTDIM fees collected shall be used exclusively for the projects
listed in Table 3 of the Report.
   (D)   If any developer pays transportation impact mitigation fees to a
member agency for the ECTIA program or other regional projects identified in
the
report for a development project in the city there shall be a credit, so long
as the member agency transfers the collected fees to the Treasurer of ECCRFFA
or ECTIA. The credit shall be an amount equal to the fees paid for the ECTIA
program or other project covered by the report.
   (E)   The RTDIM Fees are fees imposed upon new development projects, as
defined and authorized by the Mitigation Fee Act, California Government Code
Sections 66000 et seq., and accordingly are not governed by the provisions of
California Constitution Article XIIID. The fees are as established in the
following table.

('66 Code, § 3-11.01) (Ord. 757-C-S, passed 9-21-89)
§ 3-11.02 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city has a present allocation of 5.34 million gallons per day
(MGD) of sewer treatment capacity with the Delta Diablo Sanitation District.
The city is presently near or at its maximum allocation. The growth demands in
the city require the city to increase its allocation. The City of Pittsburg
presently has available two million MGD of capacity that is excess to its
needs. Pittsburg is willing to transfer such two MGD to the city pursuant to an
agreement between Pittsburg, Antioch and the Delta Diablo District.
   (B)   The draft agreement calls for the city to pay $2.5 million for the
acquisition of the allocation. Pursuant to the agreement, Delta Diablo would
advance these funds to Pittsburg, and Antioch would reimburse Delta Diablo
through the imposition of a sewer capacity acquisition fee of at least $215 per
sewer connection.
   (C)   The City Council finds that the adoption of this chapter will enable
the growth anticipated in the Antioch area to continue without being delayed or
hampered by lack of sewer capacity, and that the ordinance codified in this
chapter is necessary to preserve the public health, safety and general welfare.
('66 Code, § 3-11.02) (Ord. 757-C-S, passed 9-21-89)

('66 Code, § 3-11.03) (Ord. 757-C-S, passed 9-21-89)
§ 3-11.04 COLLECTION.
   This fee shall be collected at the time that a building permit is issued, or
if no building permit is required for the type of development, at the time of
utility hook-up.
('66 Code, § 3-11.04) (Ord. 757-C-S, passed 9-21-89)
§ 3-11.05 USE OF FEES.
   Fees shall be placed into an interest-bearing account and shall be used only
for meeting the obligations of the reallocation from Pittsburg treatment plant
capacity to Antioch agreement. Such fees shall not be considered to be proceeds
of taxes pursuant to the California Constitution.
('66 Code, § 3-11.05) (Ord. 757-C-S, passed 9-21-89)
§ 3-11.06 ANNUAL REVIEW.
   The fee shall be reviewed and adjusted as necessary annually to meet the

4-4.108   Enforcement
§ 4-4.101 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The streets within the city have been the site of continuing illegal
sideshows, speed contests, and exhibitions of speed over several years despite
law enforcement efforts to prevent and abate these illegal events through the
enforcement of existing traffic laws. Illegal motor vehicle sideshows, speed
contests and exhibitions of speed are fueled by the activities of organizers,
advertisers, and spectators. Often, such events generate profit for their
organizers and advertisers. The events are a public nuisance emitting air
pollution, including noxious odors, and noise pollution. The events also create
an environment in which illegal activities can fester. Therefore, the intent
and purpose of this chapter is to discourage organization and advertising of
illegal motor vehicle sideshows, speed contests, and exhibitions of speed in
the city. It also aims to discourage the presence of spectators at these
events.
   (B)   This chapter targets a clear, limited population and gives proper
notice to individuals as to which activities are lawful and which activities
are unlawful. The quantity of people exposed to the dangers associated with
participating in and being a spectator at illegal sideshows, street races, and
exhibitions of speed is likely to be decreased by discouraging organizers,
advertisers, and spectators from being involved with such events in the city.
   (C)   This chapter is not intended to interfere with or inhibit any exercise
of constitutionally protected rights of freedom of press and freedom of speech
such as (but not limited to) peaceful expressions of political or religious
opinions, not involving offensive personal conduct. The City Council finds and
declares that advertisements for illegal events such as street racing, motor
vehicle sideshows, speed contests, and exhibitions of speed are not legally
protected speech.
   (D)   This chapter is intended to complement state laws governing the
regulation of speed contests, exhibitions of speed, and sideshows. This chapter
is not intended to preempt state laws governing the regulation of illegal motor
vehicle sideshows, speed contests, and exhibitions of speed events.

   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall park any
motorized vehicle from which goods, wares, merchandise, fruits, vegetables, or
foodstuffs are sold, displayed, solicited, or offered for sale or bartered or
exchanged, or any motorized lunch wagon or eating cart on any portion of any

§ 4-5.1217.1 UNLAWFUL PEDDLING AND VENDING NEAR SCHOOL SITES.
   (A)   Findings.  The City Council finds that public and private school sites
experience significant traffic congestion at opening and closing times as
parents drop off and pick up children for school. The City Council further
finds that the parking of motorized vending trucks on public streets when
schools are opening and closing further exacerbates traffic problems and create
safety issues for children trying to access the peddlers and vendors. This
section is therefore necessary to protect health and safety.
   (B)   Prohibited. No person shall stop, stand, or park a motorized vehicle
trailer or stand, or other device, on any street, alley, or parkway for the
purpose of distributing or selling food, services, or merchandise within 300
feet of the property line of any public or private school within the 30 minutes
prior to classes convening and within 30 minutes after classes end for the day.
   (C)   Exception. The above prohibition shall not apply to any vendor or
peddler who has received written consent of the school principal or other
authorized school official to park, stop or stand for the purpose of vending
when such authorization does not interfere with public vehicle traffic or pose
a traffic safety hazard to school children. Any such written authorization
shall be kept and maintained with the vendor at all times for inspection.

Engineer shall have power and authority to order temporary signs to be erected
or posted indicating that the operation, parking, or standing of vehicles is
prohibited on such streets and alleys as the City Traffic Engineer shall direct

shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. Any boat, camp trailer, fifth wheel trailer, tent
trailer, travel trailer, utility trailer, camper, motorhome, camper van, travel
coach, bus, pickup truck with cabover camper, dismounted camper body, personal
watercraft, or any empty trailer intended for or capable of carrying any of the
above.
   (B)   Findings. This code, in the preceding section, already prohibits the
parking of certain oversized vehicles in residential zoning districts. This
section is intended to apply to other vehicles of similar character, which the
Council finds are creating similar adverse impacts in residential
neighborhoods, including sight distance when backing from driveways, obscuring
children and pets moving into the street area, reducing property values and
aesthetic concerns.
   (C)   Location. When on-street parking of a recreational vehicle is
authorized by this section, the parking shall occur only where contiguous with
property owned or occupied by the recreational vehicle owner or operator.
   (D)   Prohibition. No person shall park any recreational vehicle, as
defined, on any street in any residential district except when such
recreational vehicle is being actively loaded, unloaded, cleaned or repaired,
and then for a period not to exceed 24 hours.
   (E)   Exception; permit. An exception to the prohibition in this section may
be made when and if the recreational vehicle owner or operator obtains from the
Police Department a permit for temporary parking. The permits shall be issued
at no cost upon request during regular business hours and shall authorize the
parking of the recreational vehicle for a period not to exceed 72 hours from
the time indicated on the permit. The permit shall be displayed prominently on
the recreational vehicle. The Police Department may issue up to four such
temporary parking permits per residential address in any calendar year, but the
permits shall not be issued for concurrent hours of parking. At least 72 hours
shall elapse between the issuance of permits.
   (F)   Warning notice. Prior to the issuance of the first citation to a
recreational vehicle or its owner or operator for violation of this section, an
advisory notice shall be issued which notifies of the provisions of this
section.
   (G)   Penalty. The penalties, fines and methods of enforcement for this
section shall be as authorized by this code.

at any time between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on any day, except Sundays and
holidays.
      (5)   Blue shall mean no stopping, standing, or parking at any time of
any day by any vehicle other than those vehicles displaying a distinguishing

pertinent. Such facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of
the vehicle, or parts thereof, and the circumstances concerning its location on
private property or public property. The Council shall not be limited by the

thereof, if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of
the public hearing, the Council may find that a vehicle, or parts thereof, has
been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public
property, order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and
disposed of as provided in this chapter, and determine the administrative costs
and the costs of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order
requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle, or parts thereof,
and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if
available at the site.
   (C)   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he has not sub-
sequently acquiesced in its presence, the Council shall not assess the costs of
administration for removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the
vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such owner
of the land.
   (D)   If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land but does not appear,
or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the Council but does
not appear, he shall be notified in writing of the decision.

§ 4-14.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The City of Antioch Council finds and declares as follows:
   (A)   The vast majority of alarms to which the Police Department responds
are false alarms and are reported to the police by alarm companies.
   (B)   Most false alarms are the result of improper maintenance or improper
or careless use of an alarm system.
   (C)   The public and police officers are subjected to needless danger when
the officers are called to respond to false alarms.
   (D)   Officers responding to false alarms are not available to carry out
other police duties.
   (E)   In the interest of using limited police resources most effectively and
efficiently, the number of false alarms can and must be reduced.
   (F)   The purpose of this chapter is to reduce the dangers and
inefficiencies associated with false alarms and to encourage alarm companies
and property owners to maintain the operational reliability, properly use alarm
systems, and to reduce or eliminate false alarm dispatch requests.
   (G)   This chapter governs systems intended to summon a police response,
establishes fees and fines, establishes a system of administration, sets
conditions for the suspension of a police response and establishes a public
education and training program.

attachment to automatically dial a telephone line leading into the Police
Department or the city and then transmit any pre-recorded message or signal.
      (6)   Ensure that alarm users of alarm systems equipped with a duress,
robbery, holdup or panic alarm have been provided adequate training as to the
proper use of the alarm system’s operation and function.
      (7)   All alarm systems shall be supplied with an uninterrupted power
supply in such a manner that the failure or interruption of the normal electric

other electronic means and spoken to a person who believes the alarm signal is
not a false alarm and is requesting a police response; or
         (b)   The alarm site is equipped with an interior or exterior video or
audio monitored remotely by the monitoring company or the alarm user, and it
can be seen or heard that a criminal act has occurred or is occurring,
requiring a police response; or
         (c)   The alarm site is equipped with a control panel which has
confirmed that a glass break sensor has been triggered or at least two
independent zones, (e.g., an exterior perimeter and an interior zone) have been
triggered and the monitoring company has completed enhanced call confirmation
(ECC) to the alarm user; or
         (d)   The alarm is an older system and not in compliance with the two
independent zone standards, therefore, the monitoring company has received two
or more alarm signals during the same alarm event period and has completed the

as part of an alarm dispatch request.
      (8)   Communicate the type of alarm activation (silent or audible,
interior or perimeter), if available, on any alarm dispatch request.
      (9)   Notify communications (dispatch) of any alarm site that it knows,

one year after the date of an alarm dispatch request, all records relating to
the alarm dispatch request. Records must include the name, address and
telephone number of the alarm user, each alarm system zone activated, the time
of alarm dispatch request and evidence of all attempts to verify. The Alarm
Administrator may request copies of such records for any individual alarm user.
If the request is made within 60 days after an alarm dispatch request, the
monitoring company shall furnish requested records within three business days
after receiving the request. If the records are requested between 60 days and
one year after an alarm dispatch request, the monitoring company shall furnish
the requested records within 30 days after receiving the request.
      (12)   Each monitoring company shall, upon request, immediately provide
the Police Department with the names and phone numbers of the alarm user’s
emergency contacts at the time of each alarm dispatch request.

arrival at the alarm site, the response is not considered a false alarm and no
false alarm fine will be assessed.
   (E)   The alarm installation company shall be assessed a fine in an amount
established by resolution of the City Council if the police respond to a false
alarm and determine that an on-site employee of the alarm installation company
directly caused the false alarm. Such false alarms are not included in the
total number of false alarms for the alarm user, nor is the alarm user to be
held liable for any false alarm fine resulting from such alarm activation.
   (F)   A fine in an amount established by resolution of the City Council
shall be imposed against any monitoring company that fails to verify alarm

      (3)   The alarm user fails or refuses to pay an alarm registration or
alarm registration renewal fee, false alarm fine, late charge, or any other
fee, fine, or charge assessed under this section.
   (B)   It is a violation of this section for a person to operate an alarm
system during the period in which the alarm registration is suspended. It is a
violation of this chapter for a monitoring company to make an alarm dispatch
request to an alarm site after the monitoring company’s alarm response manager
(ARM) has been notified by electronic mail by the Alarm Administrator that the
registration for that alarm site has been suspended. A grace period of five
business days after the ARM’s notification shall be granted the monitoring
company to comply. The alarm monitoring company shall be assessed a fine in an

§ 4-14.14 APPEALS OF DETERMINATIONS REGARDING ALARM REGISTRATIONS, FEES AND
FINES.
   (A)   If the Alarm Administrator assesses a fee or fine, suspends an alarm
registration or denies the issuance, renewal or reinstatement of an alarm
registration, the Alarm Administrator shall send notice of the action and a
statement of the right to appeal to the affected applicant, alarm user, alarm
installation company or alarm monitoring company.
   (B)   The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm
monitoring company may appeal any action described in division (A) above to the
Police Chief by setting forth in writing the reasons for the appeal and
delivering the appeal to the Police Chief within 30 days after receipt of
notice of the action. Failure to deliver the appeal within that time period is
a waiver of the right to appeal.
   (C)   The procedure for an appeal to the Police Chief is as follows:
      (1)   The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring
company may file a written request for appeal by setting forth the reasons for

the Alarm Administrator. The Police Chief must base the decision on the
preponderance of evidence presented and the decision shall affirm or reverse
the decision or action taken by the Alarm Administrator.
      (3)   Filing of an appeal stays any action by the Alarm Administrator to
suspend an alarm registration or require the payment of a fee or fine until the
appeal process has been exhausted. This provision applies only to the action of
the Alarm Administrator that is the subject of the appeal. This provision does
not operate as a bar to enforcement action on violations of this section that
occur thereafter.
   (D)   The Alarm Administrator or the Police Chief, may adjust the count of
false alarms or assessed fees based on:
      (1)   Evidence that a false alarm was caused by action of a
communications service’s provider (i.e. telephone, cellular, cable company);
      (2)   Evidence that a false alarm was caused by a power outage of more
than four hours or severe weather such as an earthquake, flooding, or excessive
winds.
      (3)   Evidence that an alarm dispatch request was not a false alarm; or
      (4)   The occurrence of multiple alarms within a 24-hour period, which
may be considered as one false alarm if the alarm user has taken corrective
action, unless the false alarms are directly caused by the alarm user.
   (E)   The Alarm Administrator may waive all or part of a false alarm fine
due to extenuating circumstances or to encourage corrective action with
supervisor approval.
(Ord. 2161-C-S, passed 2-26-19)

      (1)   Pays, or otherwise resolves, all outstanding fees, fines, and other
charges;
      (2)   Submits a written notice from an alarm installation company stating
that the alarm system has been inspected and repaired (if necessary) by the
alarm installation company;
      (3)   The alarm user successfully completes an alarm user awareness class
and test.
   (B)   The Police Department shall reinstate its response to an alarm site as
soon as is practicable after receiving notice of reinstatement from the Alarm
Administrator. The alarm user and monitoring company shall take notice that the
alarm site has been officially reinstated only after receiving notice from the
Alarm Administrator of that fact. It shall be the responsibility of the alarm
user to verify that his, her, or its registration status and future police
response has been properly restored.

§ 4-14.16 SUSPENSION OF POLICE RESPONSE TO DISPATCH REQUESTS FROM CERTAIN ALARM
INSTALLATION COMPANIES AND MONITORING COMPANIES.
   (A)   The Police Chief may suspend police response to an alarm dispatch
request from an alarm installation company or monitoring company if it is
determined that:
      (1)   There is a violation of this chapter by the alarm installation
company or monitoring company and the condition causing the violation has not
been corrected; and/or
      (2)   The alarm installation company or monitoring company has failed to
pay any fee, fine, or other charge assessed under this section, more than 60
days after the fee, fine, or other charge is due.

where the alarm installation company or monitoring company who installed or
monitors that alarm has failed to comply with California licensing requirements
or failed to maintain a valid copy of the State of California Department of
Consumer Affairs alarm company operators license.
   (C)   A suspension of police response made pursuant to this division is
subject to the appeal process provided for within this chapter. In addition,

affected party prior to an appeal. The affected party has 60 days after the
written notice of suspension before police response is suspended to its alarm
customers.
   (D)   The Alarm Administrator shall notify all known alarm users subscribing
to an alarm installation company or an alarm monitoring company that the Police

discretion, cancel a police response to any or all alarms based on weather or
other factors affecting police service needs.
   (B)   The Police Chief may re-prioritize assignment of burglar alarms and
response time at any time during a 24-hour period as may be necessary due to
the service needs of the community.

Alarm Administrator and city. Such information is proprietary and is hereby
declared confidential and not a public record. Absent special circumstances,

(Ord. 2161-C-S, passed 2-26-19)
§ 4-14.19 SCOPE OF POLICE DUTY; IMMUNITIES PRESERVED.
   The issuance of alarm registrations does not create a contract between the
Police Department and/or the city and any alarm user, alarm installation
company or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or obligation, either
expressed or implied, on the Police Department to respond to any alarm. Any and
all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure of the Police
Department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is hereby disclaimed and
full governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an
alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges that the Police Department
response is influenced by the availability of officers, priority of calls,
traffic conditions, weather conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels,
prior response history and administrative actions.

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

in the buying or selling of new or used furniture or usable household

('66 Code, § 5-1.101) (Ord. 118-C-S, passed 6-10-70; Am. Ord. 931-C-S, passed
9-30-97; Am. Ord. 957-C-S, passed 7-13-99; Am. Ord. 2010-C-S, passed 2-26-08)
§ 5-1.102 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the intent of the City Council in adopting this chapter to
provide a comprehensive method for the identification and abatement of public
nuisances within the city to protect the health, welfare and safety of
residents and to promote the maintenance of real property to improve the
livability, appearance and social and economic conditions of the city. Public
nuisances can create visual blight or lead to neighborhood decline, causing
detriment to surrounding properties and depreciating the value of those
properties. In addition, as to abandoned, unsecured or partially constructed
buildings, the City Council finds that such buildings represent threats to
public health, safety and welfare because they invite trespassers, represent
fire hazards because a fire can begin unobserved, can become harborages for
vectors and rodents, can become littered or dumping ground or can encourage
criminal activity because the property is unsupervised.
   (B)   Provisions of this chapter are supplementary and complementary to all
other provisions of the Antioch Municipal Code, state law, and any law
cognizable at common law or in equity, and nothing herein shall be read,
interpreted or construed in any manner so as to limit any existing right or
power of the city to abate any nuisance or initiate any action provided for by
law.
(Ord. 2010-C-S, passed 2-26-08)
§ 5-1.103 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROPER PROPERTY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Every property owner is required to maintain such property in a manner
so as not to violate the provisions of this chapter and such owner remains
strictly liable for violations, such property regardless of any contract or
agreement with any third party regarding such property or of the identity or
relationship of any party responsible for creating the violation. Every
successive property owner who fails to abate a continuing nuisance is liable in
the same manner as the property owner who created the nuisance.
   (B)   Every occupant, lessee, tenant, or holder of any interest in property,
other than as owner, is required to maintain such property in the same manner
as is required of the owner, and the duty imposed by this section on the owner
thereof shall in no instance relieve those persons referenced from the similar
duty.
(Ord. 2010-C-S, passed 2-26-08)
ARTICLE 2: SPECIFICATION OF NUISANCES
§ 5-1.201 GENERAL NUISANCES PROHIBITED.

deletions made thereto;
   (C)   Any condition in violation of any section or division of the Antioch

   (F)   Any condition that is injurious to health, or is indecent or offensive
to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to
interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by an entire

fence is required, fails to erect such fence within 30 days of date of the
written notice, the city may apply for an abatement warrant to erect such
fence, and upon obtaining the warrant may erect the fence. All costs of
obtaining the warrant (including attorneys' fees) and erecting the fence shall,
at the city's sole election, be placed on the property as a special assessment
lien or collected as a debt against the property owner.
         (d)   It is unlawful for any person or entity to remove, damage,
breach or in any way interfere with a fence erected under this section. The
property owner shall at all times properly maintain such fence, including
repair or replacement, in the event of damage or deterioration.
         (e)   The property owner may apply in writing to the City Manager to
remove a fence erected under this section in the event the lot is being
developed and all necessary grading or building permits have been obtained.
Such permission shall not be withheld if such permits have been issued or if
the lot or parcel is no longer vacant.
   (B)   Buildings or structures in a state of disrepair.
      (1)   Any building or other structure, including, but not limited to,
walls, fences, signs or retaining walls, which are broken, deteriorated, or
substantially defaced (including defacement by markings commonly referred to as
"graffiti") so that the disrepair poses a risk of harm to the public, or
constitutes visual blight or reduces the aesthetic appearance of the
neighborhood, or is offensive to the senses, or is detrimental to the use and
enjoyment of nearby properties, or reduces nearby property values due to its
visibility from the public right-of-way;
      (2)   Any building or structure having dry rot, warping or termite
infestation or any building or structure on which the condition of the exterior
finish has become so deteriorated as to permit decay, excessive checking,
cracking, peeling, chalking, dry rot, warping or termite infestation so that
the disrepair poses a risk of harm to the public, or constitutes visual blight
or reduces the aesthetic appearance of the neighborhood, or is offensive to the
senses, or is detrimental to the use and enjoyment of nearby properties, or
reduces nearby property values.
   (C)   Abandoned, unsecured or partially constructed buildings.
      (1)   Any vacant building, structure or other property that is unlocked
or unsecured or has broken or missing doors or windows or other unsecured
openings allowing unauthorized access by trespassers, or constituting a
potential attraction to children or a harbor for vagrants, criminals, or other
unauthorized persons, or so as to enable persons to resort to committing
nuisance or other criminal activities:
         (a)   Except as provided below in division (b), no building or
structure shall be left in a boarded up and/or vacant condition in excess of
six months unless a valid building permit has been issued and work under that
permit is taking place to facilitate reoccupation of the building or to
demolish it. In any event, the vacant structure must be maintained in
compliance with this Code to prevent a blighted appearance of the premises.
         (b)   The City Council hereby finds that economic conditions can
reasonably cause commercial buildings to remain vacant in excess of six months.
However, the vacant commercial structure shall be maintained in such a manner
so as to not create a public nuisance. This shall include, but is not limited
to, maintaining the exterior of the structure in good repair, maintaining the
landscaping, keeping the property free of litter, trash and graffiti, and in
securing the property in compliance with division (a) above. Due to the demand
for housing, the Council finds that there generally is not a similar real
estate justification for residential dwellings to remain vacant in excess of
six months.
      (2)   Any building or structure permitted to remain in a state of partial
construction, reconstruction or demolition, whether the partial demolition is
due to manmade or natural causes such as fire or earthquake, so that it poses a
risk of harm to the public, or constitutes visual blight or reduces the
aesthetic appearance of the neighborhood, or is offensive to the senses, or is
detrimental to the use and enjoyment of nearby properties, or reduces nearby
property values;
         (a)   No partially constructed, reconstructed or demolished structure
shall be considered in a state of partial construction if there exists a valid
and current building or demolition permit and substantial work has been done
pursuant to such permit within the immediately preceding 90 days.
         (b)   No building permit shall be extended or renewed beyond one year
of the date of the issuance of the original permit, unless the Building
Official has made a good cause determination that additional time is necessary
due to the scope of the construction and the delay is due to circumstances
beyond the control of the owner or contractor, not including financial
considerations. In no event shall any structure be permitted to remain in a
partial state of construction in excess of two years.
   (D)   Parking and storage of equipment. Parking or storage of construction
equipment or machinery or other industrial or commercial equipment or machinery
in any area zoned for residential uses so that it is within the view from the
public right-of-way except while excavation, construction or demolition
operations covered by an active building or demolition permit are in progress
on the property.
   (E)   Hazardous and attractive nuisances.
      (1)   Any building, object or condition, whether natural or man-made,
which due to its accessibility to the public or potential attraction to
children poses a hazard, including, but not limited to, abandoned, unsecured,
unused or neglected motor vehicles, machinery, appliances or equipment,
abandoned or unprotected wells, shafts, foundations, or basements, hazardous or
unprotected pools, ponds, construction sites, or excavations, and stored
chemicals, gas, oil, or toxic or flammable substances;
      (2)   Erosion, subsidence, or surface water drainage problems which are
hazardous or injurious to the public or to adjacent properties whether caused
by grading operations, excavations or fill or as a result of the topography,
geology or configuration of the land in its natural state;
      (3)   Any unlawful storage or release of hazardous materials or wastes.
   (F)   Control of vectors including insects and rodents.
      (1)   Any artificial alteration of premises, excluding water, from its
natural condition, resulting in it supporting the development, attraction, or
harborage of vectors, with the presence of vectors in their developmental
stages on premises being prima facie evidence that the premises is a public
nuisance;
      (2)   Any water that is a breeding place for vectors, with the presence
of vectors in their developmental stages in the water being prima facie
evidence that the water is a public nuisance;
      (3)   Any activity or condition that supports the development,
attraction, or harborage of vectors, or that facilitates the introduction or
spread of vectors.
   (G)   Paint, paintings or signs. Any condition or maintenance of property in
a manner that is unreasonably offensive to the senses or that substantially
detracts from the aesthetic or economic values of neighboring properties,
including but not limited to painting in a garish manner or obscene paintings
or signs.

§ 5-1.203 ELECTRIFIED FENCES.
   (A)   An ELECTRIFIED FENCE for the purpose of this section means any fence
and appurtenant devices, including, but not limited to, fences and devices used
in animal control, and including, but not limited to, a fence consisting of a
single strand of wire supported by posts or other fixtures, which has an
electrical charge or is connected to a source of electrical current, and which
is so designed or placed that a person or animal coming into contact with the
conductive element of the fence receives an electrical shock.
   (B)   No person shall install or maintain within the city limits an
electrified fence.
   (C)   The Legislature has founds, at Cal. Food & Agric. Code § 17150, that
electrified fences have caused injuries and deaths to persons, particularly
children, coming into contact with such fences. TheCity Council adopts and
incorporates those legislative findings. Additionally, the City Council finds
that such fences pose threats to police officers, who may be required to climb
or go under fences during darkness of night in the performance of their duties,
and who may inadvertently come into contact with electrified fences,
potentially causing injury or death to such officers.

§ 5-1.204 COMMERCIAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)    For the purposes of this chapter, COMMERCIAL PROPERTY means non-
residential retail or office projects, or non-residential condominiums, whether
occupied or vacant, which have separate parcels within the project.
   (B)   The City Council finds that commercial projects, and commercial
condominiums, can constitute public nuisances when the maintenance of
improvements is not performed in a coordinated and uniform manner. The
requirements and standards specified in this section are designed to prevent
such projects from becoming public nuisances due to visual blight, safety
hazards and other blighting conditions.
   (C)   Commercial property as defined herein shall be required to use a
property management firm, or such other arrangement as may be approved by the
Community Development Director, for the collection of service fees and charges
and property maintenance providers.
   (D)   Landscape maintenance and litter control shall be provided for all
portions of the project in a uniform and consistent manner, including regular
weed abatement and litter control on developed and undeveloped parcels or
portions of the projects. Maintenance standards are as specified in division
(G) of this section.
   (E)   Maintenance for common areas and parking lots shall also be provided
in a uniform and consistent manner to ensure that parking lot surfaces and
striping
are maintained without holes and surface defects, all lights are functioning,
shopping carts are properly stored, exterior signage (i.e. building and
monument signage) is maintained and building exteriors (i.e. awnings and
canopies) are maintained and painted to present a good appearance, free of
graffiti. All trash and recycling enclosures and receptacles shall be
maintained at all times in a clean condition with lids or tops in place at all
times.
   (F)   An occupant or tenant of the premises shall be responsible, in the
same manner as the property owner, for compliance with this section regarding
exterior maintenance of the occupied premises and any landscaping, stormwater/
erosion control measures, signs, trash enclosures, parking facilities,
temporary fencing, and other appurtenances directly attributed or allocated to
the subject premises.
   (G)   The following criteria shall be the minimum landscape and litter
control criteria and standards for properties subject to this section:
      (1)   Regular mowing of turf areas during growing season;
      (2)   Weeds over three inches tall will be removed;
      (3)   Plant material not to cover any part of sidewalks or walkways;
      (4)   All plant material maintained in a healthy, growing condition, in
compliance with approved landscape plan for the project where applicable;

   (A)   The city shall give at least ten days written notice of the abatement
hearing to the owner of the affected property by regular first class mail,
postage fully prepaid and by certified mail, return receipt requested. The
notice shall be mailed to each property owner at the last known address of the

Panel or a Hearing Officer, as determined by the City Manager, shall hear and
consider all relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, applicable staff
reports, objections, or protests relative to the existence of the alleged
public nuisance and/or the manner proposed for abatement thereof. The owner may
present relevant evidence to show cause why the alleged public nuisance should
not be abated and why any costs incurred by the city for the abatement thereof
should not constitute a special assessment against the premises. The hearing
may be continued from time to time, without further written notice. The hearing
shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence.
   (B)   Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the Administrative Review Panel or
Hearing Officer shall, based upon the evidence presented, determine whether the
premises, or any part thereof, as maintained, constitutes a public nuisance. If
the Hearing Officer, or Administrative Review Panel by a majority vote of the
members present, finds that a public nuisance exists, then the Administrative
Review Panel or Hearing Officer shall issue an order of abatement, which shall
direct and order the nuisance abated within the time, and in the manner, set
forth in the order, and that all abatement costs that may be incurred by the
city to abate the nuisance, if necessary, shall constitute a special assessment
against said premises. This determination shall be final.

§ 5-1.314 SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   (A)   If, in the opinion of the City Manager, or in the case of a structure
or building, in the opinion of the Building Official, there exists any
condition on any premises within the city which is of such a nature as to be
immediately dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare, or that
constitutes an immediate threat of injury to any person or damage to property
which, if not abated, would, during the pendency of the abatement procedures
set forth in this chapter, subject the public or property to potential injury
or harm of a serious nature, the condition may be abated by the city
immediately without compliance with the provisions of this code.
   (B)   No summary abatement shall be undertaken unless the City Attorney or
his or her authorized representative first approves it.
   (C)   The owner of the property that was the subject of the summary
abatement shall be served with written notice, within two business days
following the summary abatement action, of the right to request a post-
deprivation hearing before the Board of Administrative Appeals or hearing
officer as determined by the city provided such request is made within ten
calendar days of the date of the notice of the summary abatement action. The
notice of the summary abatement action and right to request a post- deprivation
hearing within ten calendar days shall be served by one or more of the
following means: by personal service or by regular first class mail, postage
fully prepaid, to each property owner at the last known address of the property
owner; or if, after diligent search, the owner of the property cannot be found,
the notice shall be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous location
upon the property. Failure of the property owner to receive “actual” notice
shall not affect the validity of the proceedings.
   (D)   The cost of the summary abatement, including all administrative costs
of any action taken hereunder and reasonable attorneys’ fees, may be assessed
against the subject premises as a special assessment lien or made a personal
obligation of the owner as provided in this code.

ARTICLE 4: GRAFFITI
§ 5-1.401 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that the increase of graffiti on both public and
private buildings, structures, and other places creates a condition of blight
within the city that can result in the deterioration of property values,
business opportunities, and enjoyment of life for persons using adjacent and
surrounding properties. The City Council further finds that the presence of
graffiti is inconsistent with the city's goals of maintaining property,
preventing crime, and preserving aesthetic standards. Unless graffiti is
quickly removed, it encourages the creation of additional graffiti on nearby
buildings and structures.
(Ord. 931-C-S, passed 9-30-97)
§ 5-1.402 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   The City Council declares graffiti is a public nuisance, subject to
abatement as prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 931-C-S, passed 9-30-97)
§ 5-1.403 PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PROPERTY OWNER.
   (A)   Notice of violation. A property owner shall not permit property that
has been defaced with graffiti to remain so defaced for a period of 10 calendar
days after Neighborhood Improvement Services has by first class mail served the
property owner with notice of the existence of the graffiti nuisance. The
notice of violation shall inform the property owner of his or her right to
request a hearing.
   (B)   Notice of hearing. If a hearing is requested by the property owner,
Neighborhood Improvement Services shall give the property owner not less than
48 hours notice of a hearing to be held by the hearing officer for the purpose
of showing cause why the public nuisance should not be abated by the city. The
notice shall contain:
      (1)   The street address and such other description as is required to
identify the premises.
      (2)   A statement specifying the conditions that constitute the nuisance.
      (3)   An order to the property owner to appear before a hearing officer
at a stated time, but in no event less than 48 hours after having mailed such
notice, to show cause why the premises should not be declared a public nuisance
and abated in accordance with this chapter.
      (4)   A statement advising the property owner that he or she has the
option of voluntarily abating the nuisance prior to the date set for the
hearing. If the property owner chooses voluntary abatement, such abatement must
be completed prior to the hearing date. The property owner must advise
Neighborhood Improvement Services in writing that he or she will abate the
nuisance, and the date of completion. Neighborhood Improvement Services will
inspect the premises on the completion date, and if the nuisance has been
abated, the hearing will be taken off the calendar and administrative fee
refunded. The property owner may request a continuance of the hearing pursuant
to §
5-1.403 (F).
   (C)   Service of hearing notice. The hearing notice, and any amended or
supplemental notice, shall be served upon the property owner in the same manner
as a summons in a civil action.
   (D)   Hearings - generally. At the time set for hearing, the hearing officer
shall proceed to hear testimony of investigators of Neighborhood Improvement
Services, witnesses, the property owner, and any other competent person
regarding the condition of the premises, and other relevant facts concerning
the matter.
   (E)   Record or oral evidence at hearing. The proceedings at the hearing
shall be recorded by a tape recorder. Either party may provide a certified
shorthand reporter to maintain a record of the proceedings at the party's own
expense. Preparation of a record of the proceeding shall be governed by Cal.
Civ. Proc. Code § 1094.6, as presently written or subsequently amended.
   (F)   Continuances. The hearing officer may, upon request of the property
owner or upon request of the Coordinator of Neighborhood Improvement Services,
grant continuances from time to time for good cause shown, or upon his or her
own motion. However, continuances shall be disfavored due to the legislative
finding that graffiti tends to encourage additional graffiti.
   (G)   Evidence rules. Cal. Gov't Code § 11513 (a)-(c), as presently written
or subsequently amended, shall apply to hearings under Title 5 of the Antioch

§ 5-4.02 NUMBER OF LOCATION AND LICENSES LIMITED.
   (A)   It is hereby found and determined that the public health, safety, and
welfare require that the number and location of licensed card rooms in the city
be limited, and the following regulations are required to fulfill such
objectives:
      (1)   The total number of licensed card rooms permitted in the city shall
be no more than those in operation as of September 1, 2015 and licensed by the
city on that date, unless otherwise limited by the Act or subsequent state law.
      (2)   When, pursuant to the provisions of this section, a card room
license can be granted, it shall be granted or denied in the numerical order in
which the application was made, all applications being subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   No card room license shall be granted, nor shall the transfer of
the location of an existing card room license be authorized, until a use permit
and the approval of the Council has first been obtained. A use permit may be
granted if the proposed location will be desirable to the public convenience or
welfare and will be in harmony with the zoning provisions, the General Plan,
this subchapter and any specific plan and if the location is proper in relation
to adjacent uses.
      (4)   No more than one card room license shall be issued for the downtown
area. The downtown area is described as that territory bounded by the San
Joaquin River to Sixth Street and L to A Streets. The Council finds that in the
past an undue concentration of card rooms in the downtown area has helped lead
to blighting conditions.
      (5)   A card room shall not be located within 1,000 feet of a public or
private pre-school or K-12 school, a licensed hospital, medical clinic, alcohol
or other drug abuse recovery or treatment center, or community care residential
facility providing mental and/or social rehabilitation service, a public park
or playground, a public library, a church or place of worship, or another card
room or place where gambling is permitted. The footage distance shall be
measured from the closest point on the exterior property lines of the card room
establishment to the closest point on the exterior property lines of the other
property. The location of a card room that was licensed and operating at that
location as of September 1, 2015 is exempt from this subsection.

Initiative, adopted 6-7-16)
§ 5-4.03 LICENSE APPLICATION.
   (A)   Application to Commission; requirements. Every person making an
application for a card room license shall submit an application under oath to
the Commission for review and consideration, pursuant to the procedures and fee
schedule in the Act and regulations set by the Commission. The City Council
shall not consider an application for a city Card Room License until the
Commission has granted a card room license to the applicant for the requested
location.
   (B)   Application to city; requirements. Every person making an application
for a card room license shall submit an application, under oath, to the Chief
of Police, which shall include the following:
      (1)   The true names and addresses of the applicant and of all persons
financially interested in the business. PERSONS FINANCIALLY INTERESTED shall
include all persons who share in the profits of the business in any form;
      (2)   The criminal record, if any, of any of the persons named in the
application;
      (3)   The fingerprints and photographs of the applicant and of all
persons financially interested in the business;
      (4)   Any other information required by the Chief of Police; and
      (5)   Any application fee and/or deposit required under the Master Fee
Schedule.
(Ord. 2051-C-S, passed 10-25-11; Am. Ord. 2095-C-S, passed 2-24-15)
§ 5-4.04 LICENSE; DENIAL.
   (A)   Denial by Commission; grounds. The Commission, upon the receipt of the
application, shall either grant or deny the application. Denial may be upon one
or more of the grounds in the act and/or regulations set by the Commission.
   (B)   Denial by the Council; grounds. The Council, upon the receipt of the
report of the Chief of Police, shall either grant or deny the application. A
license application for a new license or the transfer of an existing license
shall be denied if the Council finds one or more of the following:
      (1)   That the applicant or any person financially interested in the
applicant or business has been convicted of a felony;
      (2)   That, in the opinion of the Council, the applicant or any person
financially interested in the applicant or business is not of good moral
character;
      (3)   That any of the information furnished or required in the
application or submitted in connection with the application was false or
misleading, or material information was omitted with the probable intent to
conceal the facts; and
      (4)   That, in the opinion of the Council, the proposed location for the
card room would be incompatible with the uses being made of the property in the
immediate vicinity or injurious to the health, safety, or morals of the people
of the city.
      (5)   That the applicant or a person financially interested in the
applicant or business, does not have a state gambling license or license
endorsement for the card room in good standing. For the purposes of this
subsection, a license or owner’s license endorsement is not in good standing if
the state license or endorsement expired without a new license or endorsement
being issued prior to its expiration, the license has been suspended or revoked
by the Commission, or the applicant is subject to a pending disciplinary
accusation before the Commission which seeks revocation of the applicant’s
state gambling license.
   (C)   Denial; effect. Denial of the application shall cause the applicant to
lose his place on the numerical ranking list. If the applicant desires future
consideration, he shall file a new application, which shall be placed at the
bottom of the numerical ranking of applicants.

Initiative, adopted 6-7-16)
§ 5-4.05 LICENSE; ISSUANCE TO ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES ONLY.
In addition to the other requirements contained in this chapter, no new license
shall be issued for a card room other than in an established place of business
of sufficient size and volume that the already established business is the
major business of the place rather than the business of operating such card
room. This section does not apply to licenses issued under §
5-4.08.

§ 5-4.06 LICENSE FEE.
   (A)   Every person conducting, using, and/or maintaining on premises owned,
used, or leased by him any card room or card tables which may be used by
patrons of the premises shall pay a license fee in the amount established in
the Master Fee Resolution and the fee schedule in the Act and regulations set
forth by the Commission.
   (B)   The license fees for card tables shall be in addition to any other
license fees or taxes imposed upon the established business therein.
(Ord. 2051-C-S, passed 10-25-11; Am. Ord. 2095-C-S, passed 2-24-15)
§ 5-4.07 FAILURE TO PAY FEES; REVOCATION OF LICENSES.
   If any person conducting a card room shall fail to pay the fees specified by
§
5-4.06 of this article or other fees, rates or taxes pursuant to the Antioch
Municipal Code or Master Fee Schedule following notice from the Finance
Department that such fees are delinquent, the Director of Financial Services
shall so notify the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police shall notify the
licensee of the intention of the Chief of Police to revoke the card room
license for failure to pay the fees, rates or taxes. If such fees, rates or
taxes are not then paid within ten calendar days after such notice, the Chief
of Police shall revoke such license. During the ten calendar day time period,
the licensee may have the opportunity to present to the Chief of Police
evidence that the amount of fees, rates or taxes being assessed is incorrect.
The Chief of Police may order the adjustment of the fees, rates or taxes being
imposed. If payment is made prior to revocation, a 50% penalty shall be added
to the fees, rates and taxes due and owing. The remedy of revocation shall be
in addition to the civil or criminal remedies available to the city.
(Ord. 2051-C-S, passed 10-25-11; Am. Ord. 2095-C-S, passed 2-24-15)
§ 5-4.08 LICENSE NONTRANSFERABLE; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Except as provided in §
5-4.08 of this chapter, no card room license shall be assignable or
transferable, except that a city gambling license that was in effect on
September 1, 2015 for a card room in operation on that date may be transferable
to the purchaser, heir or other successor in interest of that established
business where the license is used and operated; however, the transferee,
before operating the card room, shall obtain permission for the card room
license transfer from the Council in the same manner as for an original
issuance under §
5-4.04, the Chief of Police forwarding his report and recommendation to the
Council prior to action being taken. The approval or disapproval of any card
room license transfer permitted by this section shall be within the sole
discretion of the Council based on the criteria established by this chapter and
in compliance with §
5-4.04. If a request for a license transfer has not been made within 60 days
after the business sale takes place, the card room license shall expire.
   (B)   For a license that was in effect for a card room operating on
September 1, 2015, in the event the existing business to which the card room
license is necessarily attached reverts to the former card room license holder
because of the nonpayment of the purchase price or by reason of contract,
operation of law, or otherwise, the card room license may be transferred to the
former card room license holder subject to Council approval under §
5-4.04. In all other cases, the license shall automatically expire.
(Ord. 2051-C-S, passed 10-25-11; Am. Ord. 2095-C-S, passed 2-24-15; Measure E
Initiative, adopted 6-7-16)
§ 5-4.09 SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION OF LICENSE.
   (A)   The Council may suspend or revoke a card room license on any of the
grounds set forth in §
5-4.04 of this chapter, on the ground that the card room business has become
the main business of the establishment, or on the ground that the licensee has
violated a provision of this chapter. If a card room license is not used by the
operation of card tables on the premises to which the card room license is
attached for a period of six consecutive months, the card room license shall
automatically expire.
   (B)   However, a card room license may be moved from one established
business location to another by the licensee provided the new location has been
first approved by the Council within six months after card room activity has
ceased at the premises to which the card room license was last attached. The
Council may grant an additional six months for a business relocation upon a
showing of hardship by the licensee.

('66 Code, § 5-5.02) (Ord. 590-C-S, passed 9-11-84)
§ 5-5.03 NATURE AND EXTENT OF GRANT.
   (A)   Any nonexclusive franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall authorize and permit the grantee to engage in the business of
constructing, operating, and maintaining a CATV system in the city and for that
purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain,
and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across, and along any public street or

its equivalent.
('66 Code, § 5-5.04) (Ord. 590-C-S, passed 9-11-84)
§ 5-5.05 DURATION OF FRANCHISES.
   (A)   No franchise granted by the City Council under this chapter, shall be
for a term longer than 15 years following the date of acceptance of such
franchise by the grantee or the renewal thereof; provided, however, the City
Council may extend the term of any franchise then in effect for an additional
term of no more than 10 years.
   (B)   (1)   Any such franchise may be terminated prior to its date of
expiration by the Council in the event the grantee fails or refuses to
substantially comply with the city's demand that a violation be corrected of
any material provision, term, or condition of this chapter or any franchise or
permit issued under this chapter. If the city deems the grantee to be in
violation of any provision, term, or condition of this chapter or any franchise
issued under this chapter, the city shall make a written demand that the
grantee take corrective action. If the alleged violation by the grantee
continues for a period of 120 calendar days following such written demand
without a response from the grantee that the corrective action has been taken,
that corrective action is being actively and expeditiously pursued, or that the
grantee is otherwise not in violation of this chapter, the city may place the
issue of the termination of the franchise before the Council. The Council shall
cause to be served upon the grantee, at least 20 calendar days prior to the
date of the Council meeting, a written notice of intent to consider such
termination for failure to correct the alleged violation, a statement of the
nature and scope of the alleged violation, and the time and place of the
meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and the issue which the
Council is to consider. The Council shall hear and consider the issue, shall
hear any person interested on the issue, and shall determine whether or not the
alleged violation has occurred. If the Council determines that the alleged
violation by the grantee has occurred, the Council shall also determine whether
the violation is the fault of the grantee and was within the grantee's
reasonable control to correct. If the violation is the fault of the grantee and
was within the grantee's reasonable control to correct, the Council may declare
that the franchise of the grantee be terminated. All factual and legal issues
raised by the Council's decision to terminate the franchise may be determined
by a court having jurisdiction provided such action is commenced within 90
calendar days after the grantee receives written notice of the decision to
terminate. All factual and legal issues raised by the Council's decision to
terminate the franchise may be determined de novo by a court having
jurisdiction in accordance with the rules of civil procedure and evidence
applicable to breach of contract actions between private parties.
      (2)   If any provision of this chapter becomes invalid or unenforceable
because of a superseding law, regulation, or court decision, and if such
provision constitutes a consideration material to the grant of such franchise,
then the parties shall have the opportunity to open up the franchise ordinance
and agreement for amendments mutually agreeable to the parties; provided,
however, any such amendment shall conform to and, if appropriate, incorporate
relevant provisions of state or federal laws.

   (A)   No privileges or exemptions are granted or conferred by this chapter,
except those specifically prescribed in it. The franchise granted by this
chapter shall be subordinate to any existing lawful public use or any existing
franchise or lawful occupancy of any public highway, street, road, or other
public property for the purpose of erecting, operating, and maintaining poles,
lines, conduits, cables, gas pipelines, and other necessary fixtures used in
connection with the purpose of existing franchises or any extension of them if
such use, franchise, or occupancy would be frustrated by the grantee's proposed
exercise of the rights granted to it by the franchise.
   (B)   No franchise granted by this chapter may be sold, transferred, leased,
assigned, or disposed of as a whole, or in part, or otherwise without the prior
consent of the city expressed in writing, and then only under such conditions
as may be prescribed in the consenting agreement; provided, however, the city
shall not unreasonably withhold consent; and provided, further, no such consent
shall be required for any transfer in trust, mortgage, or other hypothecation,
as a whole, to secure an indebtedness.
   (C)   In the event the grantee is a corporation, prior approval of the
Council, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall be required where the
ownership or control of more than 30% of the voting stock of the grantee is
proposed to be acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none
of whom already own or control 30% or more of the voting stock, singularly or
collectively. Further, any acquisition of stock or equity to increase total
ownership to an amount of 30% or greater by a person or group of persons acting
in concert shall similarly require Council approval. Any such acquisition
occurring without the prior approval of the Council shall constitute a failure
to comply with a provision of this chapter.

other public facilities damaged by the grantee's work. The city shall have the
right to withdraw sufficient funds for such repairs following 15 calendar days'
written notice to the grantee that such repairs are necessary and the grantee
fails to perform the necessary repair, replacement, or restoration. Upon such

distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone service and
those of the utility providing electric service are underground or hereafter
may be placed underground, then the grantee shall likewise construct, operate,

of transmitting signals underground to the extent that the transmission or
distribution facilities of such utilities are underground. For the purposes of
this section, UNDERGROUND shall include a partial under-ground system. The city

placing the grantee's facilities underground.
   (G)   The entire distribution system of the grantee, including poles, posts,

substantially complying with the requirements of this chapter; or the franchise
has been terminated or has expired, the grantee, at its sole expense, shall
remove promptly from the street, dedicated public right-of-way, or other city

other evidence which, in the judgment of the City Manager, casts doubt on the
reliability or quality of cable service, the City Manager shall have the right
and authority to compel the grantee to test, analyze, and report on the
performance of that part of the system involved in the problem. Such test or
tests shall be made, and the reports of such test or tests shall be delivered

makes such a request to the grantee. Such report shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaint which precipitated the special tests;
what system component was tested; and the equipment used and procedures
employed if complaints were resolved. Any other information pertinent to the
special test shall also be recorded.
   (D)   The city's right under this division shall be limited to requiring
tests, analyses, and reports, covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on such complaints or other evidence, when and under such circumstances
as the city has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other
evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against
substandard cable service.

issue a verbal and written warning, or charge the person with a violation of
the section and issue a summons directing the person to appear in court.

ARTICLE 3: SOLICITATION OF MOTORISTS
§ 5-10.301 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds that solicitors, as defined herein, create the
following traffic safety issues when they are present in the center median or
in the middle location of streets:
   (A)   Seatbelted drivers, when reaching for their wallets or money, or when
lowering windows, can ease up on their brake pedals, causing their vehicle to
roll past the limit line and into an intersection;
   (B)   Drivers who may feel intimated by the close proximity of the solicitor
may stop well behind or well beyond the limit line, thus either confusing
drivers behind or not triggering a traffic signal device or entering into
opposing traffic;
   (C)   Drivers who wish to give the solicitor money, while reaching for
monies or rolling down a window, may not observe that their traffic signal has
turned green, creating the potential for delays and possible accidents from
vehicles behind;
   (D)   With the solicitor in close proximity to the driver, drivers can
become distracted by the solicitor and may not observe other traffic hazards
such as signals, pedestrians or other vehicles;
   (E)   By remaining for long periods of time in the center of the street,
solicitors increase the danger to themselves that they may be struck by an
errant vehicle.
   (F)   Solicitors who are holding or wearing advertising or directional signs
are distracting to drivers when they stand and move about with their signs in
the median or center areas of streets;
   (G)   The Council, in enacting this article, does so pursuant to its police
power as stated in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution, in
addition to the power set forth in Cal. Penal Code § 647(f). This article is
timely and appropriate because current state laws and city ordinances are
insufficient to address the stated problems.
   (H)   This article is not intended to limit any person from exercising their
constitutional right to solicit funds, protest or engage in other
constitutionally protected activity. Rather, its goal is to protect citizens
and solicitors themselves from various traffic safety concerns as expressed
herein.
(Ord. 1066-C-S, passed 1-24-06)
§ 5-10.302 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this article:
   SOLICIT means to request an immediate donation of money or other thing of
value from another person, regardless of the solicitor's purpose or intended
use of the money or other thing of value. The solicitation may be, without
limitation, by the spoken, written, or printed word, or by other means of
communication such as by merely standing or sitting in the designated area for
an extended period of time. SOLICIT also means to hold or wear a sign
advertising or providing direction for commercial purposes.
   SOLICITOR means any person who stands, sits or remains at or near the center
of a street or highway, either in a median strip or otherwise, to solicit.
(Ord. 1066-C-S, passed 1-24-06)
§ 5-10.303 PROHIBITED ACTS.
   It is unlawful for any person to solicit money or other things of value, or
to solicit the sale of goods or services, or to hold or wear an advertising or
directional sign:
   (A)   From at or near the center of a street or highway, in a median strip
or otherwise;
   (B)   From at or near the center of a privately-owned driveway which
intersects with a public street where the solicitor is located within the
public right-of-way;
   (C)   From at or near the center of a privately-owned driveway which
intersects with a public street when the agent in charge of such property has
filed a written request for enforcement of this article with the Chief of
Police and where such private property is signed and designated for public
enforcement pursuant to §
4-5.411 of this code.

§ 5-11.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate computer gaming and
internet access businesses to promote the protection of the public from the
dangers of fire and hazards to health, to ensure the full protection of minors,
and for the general preservation of the peace and welfare of the community. It
is the intent of the city to establish minimally intrusive protocols to provide
reasonable accountability for computer gaming and internet access and use at
computer gaming and internet access businesses. The city finds such
accountability to be reasonably necessary to minimize the risk of use of the
computer and/or internet by persons at computer gaming and internet access
businesses for criminal purposes and to increase the opportunities for the safe
apprehension of such persons patronizing computer gaming and internet
businesses for criminal purposes, while recognizing rights of individuals to
use the internet and computer gaming and internet access businesses for
legitimate purposes.

web, internet, e-mail, video games, or computer software programs which operate
alone or are networked (via LAN, WAN or otherwise) or which function as a

COMPUTER GAMING AND INTERNET ACCESS BUSINESS  is synonymous with a personal
computer (“PC”) café, internet café, cyber café, sweepstakes gaming facilities,
business center, internet sales business, and internet center, but does not
include a Public use or internet learning center as defined herein.

shall be denied.
      (1)   In the event that an application for a license or renewal thereof

received three days after mailing.
      (2)   The decision of the Community Development Director may be appealed
by filing a written notice requesting a hearing within ten calendar days of the
decision of the Community Development Director. The appeal may be heard by a
hearing officer (for purposes of this section, the term HEARING OFFICER shall
mean the City Manager or a hearing officer appointed by the City Manager) or by

or non-renewal exist. Within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, the

written findings based on the evidence submitted and a statement of the order.
A copy of the decision shall be forwarded by certified mail, postage prepaid,

of Administrative Appeals shall become effective three days after its mailing

duly noticed meeting within 45 days from the date the written appeal was filed,
independently review the entire record, including the recording or transcript
of the hearing and any oral or written arguments which may be offered to the
City Council by the appellant. At the conclusion of the review, a majority of
the City Council members present may decide to sustain the decision, modify the
decision, or order the decision stricken and issue such order as the City
Council finds is supported by the entire record. The lack of a majority to take
action means that the decision of the hearing officer or Board of
Administrative Appeals remains in effect. The action of the City Council shall
be final and conclusive, shall be rendered in writing within ten days, and
shall be immediately mailed or delivered to the applicant.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any provisions in this chapter regarding the
occurrence of any action within a specified period of time, the applicant may
request additional time beyond that provided or may request a continuance
regarding any decision or consideration by the city of the pending appeal.
Extensions of time sought by applicants shall not be considered delay on the
part of the city or constitute failure by the city to provide for prompt
decisions on applications.
   (J)   The time for a court challenge to a decision under this section is
governed by California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.8 and notice of the
city’s decision and its findings shall include citation to California Code of
Civil Procedure § 1094.8.

following notice and a hearing.
   (B)   No revocation shall become effective until the license holder has been
notified in writing of the right to a hearing pursuant to the provisions of §
5-11.20(G) of this chapter. Notice of the pending revocation and right to

notice provided in division (B) of this section above, the city shall conduct
an appeal hearing as provided in §
5-11.20(G), (H), (I), and (J), above. The revocation shall be stayed pending
the decision, unless, in the determination of the City Manager, immediate
suspension pending the hearing is necessary due to an immediate threat to the
public health, safety, or welfare. Otherwise, the revocation shall become

CHAPTER 13: POLICE SERVICES RELATED TO UNRULY GATHERINGS AND NUISANCES

§ 5-13.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Due to inadequate supervision, some gatherings of people, such as
parties, become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to
the peace, health, safety and general welfare of the public. Examples of such
unruly conduct include: excessive noise, excessive traffic, obstruction of
public streets, public drunkenness, use of illegal drugs, the service of
alcohol to minors, assaults, fights, gunshots, disturbances of the peace and
litter.
   (B)   Gatherings where minors are present and where alcoholic beverages or
illegal drugs are in the possession of, or being consumed by, minors are
harmful to the community and the minors, and constitutes a public nuisance.
Cal. Business and Professions Code § 25658 makes it unlawful to furnish any
alcoholic beverage to a minor. Cal. Business and Professions Code § 25662 makes
it unlawful for a minor to possess an alcoholic beverage in any public place.
   (C)   At times, the city is required to make multiple responses to loud or
unruly gatherings, or gatherings where alcohol or illegal drugs are available
to minors, to restore and maintain the peace and protect public safety. Such
gatherings are a burden on scarce city resources and can result in delayed or
reduced police responses to regular and emergency calls in the rest of the
city.
   (D)   Police responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate
expenditure of the city's public safety resources, which are paid by the
general municipal taxes paid by residents and property owners.
   (E)   If people are held responsible for allowing or hosting a loud or
unruly gathering, or a gathering where alcohol or illegal drugs are available
to minors, they will be more likely to properly supervise or stop those
gatherings.
   (F)   The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, peace,
safety and quiet enjoyment of residential property, and to protect the public
health, peace and safety in and around businesses.
(Ord. 2104-C-S, passed 5-12-15)

§ 5-19.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The City Council finds and declares as follows:
   (A)   In enacting this chapter, the City Council recognizes that commercial
massage therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer the public valuable
health and therapeutic services. The Council further recognizes that, unless
properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of
massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat
to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose
and intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by
providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy
services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on
under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation,
health, and operational standards for massage businesses.
   (B)   Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to address
the negative impacts identified in the Council's findings to reduce or prevent
neighborhood blight and to protect and preserve the quality of city
neighborhoods and commercial districts and to enhance enforcement of criminal
statutes relating to the conduct of operators and employees of massage
businesses.
   (C)   It is the Council's further purpose and intent to rely upon the
uniform statewide regulations applicable to massage practitioners and
establishments that were enacted by the State Legislature in 2008 as Cal.
Business and Professions Code §§ 4600 et seq. by Senate Bill 731, and amended
in 2011 by Assembly Bill 619, and in 2014 by Assembly Bill 1147, to restrict
the commercial practice of massage in the city to those persons duly certified
to practice by the California Massage Therapy Council and to provide for the
regulation of massage businesses for health and safety purposes to the extent
allowed by law.

notified of this determination: continues the behavior described as a
potentially dangerous dog or animal; or is not kept indoors or secured on the
owner's property. Here, SECURED means contained within a fence or structure

§ 6-3.205 INFEASIBILITY EXEMPTION.
   (A)   Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique
circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the
diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time
that he or she submits the WMP. Increased costs to the applicant generally will
not be a sufficient basis for an exemption unless such costs are extraordinary.
The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the maximum amount of diversion he or
she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that
he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement.
   (B)   Meeting with WMP Compliance Official. The WMP Compliance Official
shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the
applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. Upon
request of the city, the WMP Compliance Official may request the staff from the
Solid Waste Division attend this meeting or may require the applicant to
request a separate meeting with Solid Waste Division staff. Based on the
information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, Solid Waste Division
staff, the WMP Compliance Official shall determine whether it is possible for
the applicant to meet the diversion requirement.
   (C)   Granting of Exemption. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that
it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to
unique circumstances, he or she shall establish a minimum feasible diversion
rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the WMP submitted by the
applicant. The WMP Compliance Official shall return a copy of the WMP to the
applicant marked "Approved for Infeasible Exemption."
   (D)   Denial of exemption. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that it
is feasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she
shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have 30 days to
resubmit a WMP form.

construction and demolition material type generated the actual material volume
or weight the project generated and receipts from both the disposal and
recycling facilities and/or licensed haulers and vendors that received each
material showing clearly whether the material was disposed or recycled; and
         (b)   Any additional information the applicant believes is relevant to
determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this article.
   (B)   Weighing of wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure
that all C&D debris diverted or landfilled are measured and recorded using the
most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all
construction and demolition debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales.
Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for
accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition debris for which
weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a
volumetric measurement shall be used.
   (C)   Determination of compliance and release of permit. The WMP Compliance
Official shall review the information submitted under division (A) above and
determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement, as
follows:
      (1)   Full compliance. If the WMP Compliance Officer determines that the
applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement applicable to the
project, he or she shall indicate such compliance on the WMP.
      (2)   Good faith effort to comply. If the WMP Compliance Official
determines that the diversion requirement has not been achieved, he or she
shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether the applicant has made a good
faith effort to comply with this article. In making this determination, the WMP
Compliance Official shall consider the availability of markets for the C&D
debris landfilled, the size of the project, and the documented efforts of the
applicant to divert C&D debris. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that
the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this article, he or
she shall so indicate on the WMP.
      (3)   Noncompliance. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this article, or if
the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by division (A) above
within the required time period, then the applicant shall be in violation of
this article and be liable for a civil penalty, including that authorized by §
9-5.2707.1 of this code, in addition to any other remedy provided by this

§ 6-7.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is:
   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply of the city from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within its customers'
internal distribution systems such contaminants or pollutants which could
backflow or back-siphon into the public water supply system;
   (B)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between its customers' in-plant potable water systems and
nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial piping systems; and
   (C)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
('66 Code, § 6-7.01) (Ord. 262-C-S, passed 10-10-74)
§ 6-7.02 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The City Engineer shall be responsible for the protection of the public
potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the
backflow or back-siphonage of contaminants or pollutants through the water
service connection. If, in the judgment of the City Engineer, an approved
backflow prevention device is required at the city's water service connection
to any customer's premises for the safety of the water system, the City
Engineer or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to such customer
to install such an approved backflow prevention device at each service
connection to his premises. The customer shall immediately install such
approved device, at his own expense, and failure, refusal, or inability on the
part of the customer to install such device immediately shall constitute a
ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device has
been properly installed.
('66 Code, § 6-7.02) (Ord. 262-C-S, passed 10-10-74)
§ 6-7.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AIR-GAP. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere
between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank,
plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of such vessel. An
approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe and,
in no case, less than one inch. When an air-gap is used at the service
connection to prevent the contamination or pollution of the public potable
water system, an emergency bypass shall be installed around the air-gap system,
and an approved reduced pressure principle device shall be installed in the
bypass system.
   APPROVED. Accepted by the City Engineer as meeting an applicable
specification stated or cited in this chapter, or as suitable for the proposed
use.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary
waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or
any natural source, such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, and the
like, or “used waters” or “industrial fluids.” These waters may be polluted or
contaminated or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water
source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
   BACKFLOW. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under
pressure into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any
source other than its intended source.
   BACK-SIPHONAGE. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances
into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source
other than its intended source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in
the potable water supply system.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTER. A device or means designed to prevent backflow or back-
siphonage.
   CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage,
industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds, or other materials to a degree
which creates an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or
through the spread of disease.
   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains
potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of
questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow or back-
siphonage may occur into the potable water system. A water service connection
between a public potable water distribution system and a customer's water
distribution system which is cross-connected to a contaminated fixture or
industrial fluid system or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary
water system constitutes one type of cross-connection. Other types of cross-
connections include connectors, such as swing connections, removable sections,
four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over
devices, sliding multiport tubes, solid connections, and the like.
   CROSS-CONNECTION, CONTROLLED. A connection between a potable water system
and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention device
properly installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate
with the degree of hazard.
   CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL BY CON-TAINMENT. The installation of an approved
backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's
premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and
permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections
within the customer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an
approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and
supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or
potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or
controlled at the point of cross-connection.
   CITY ENGINEER. The City Engineer of the city.
   DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY. An assembly of two independently operating
approved check valves with tightly closing shutoff valves on each side of the
check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check
valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications
and approval of a recognized and city approved testing agency for backflow
prevention devices. To be approved these devices shall be readily accessible
for in-line maintenance and testing.
   HAZARD, DEGREE OF. The elevation of the potential risk to public health and
the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system as:
      (1)    HAZARD, HEALTH. Any condition, device, or practice in the water
supply system and its operation which could create, or, in the judgment of the
City Engineer, may create, a danger to the health and well-being of the water
consumer. An example of a health hazard is a structural defect, including
cross-connections, in a water supply system.
      (2)    HAZARD, PLUMBING. A plumbing type cross-connection in a consumer's
potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker,
air-gap separation or backflow prevention device. Unprotected plumbing type
cross-connections shall be considered to be health hazards.
      (3)    HAZARD, POLLUTIONAL. An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the
consumer's potable water system but which would constitute a nuisance or be
aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its
appurtenances but would not be dangerous to health.
      (4)    HAZARD, SYSTEM. An actual or potential threat of severe damage to
the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's
potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
   INDUSTRIAL FLUIDS SYSTEM. Any system containing a fluid or solution which
may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a
form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional,
or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may
include, but not be limited to, polluted or contaminated waters; all types of
process waters and “used waters” originating from the public potable water
system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid
form; plating acids and alkalies; circulated cooling waters connected to an
open cooling tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically
treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters, such
as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals
or systems, and the like; and oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and
acid solutions, and other liquid and gaseous fluids used for industrial or
other purposes or for fire-fighting purposes.
   POLLUTION. The presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or
biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a
hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does
not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and
unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use.
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE DEVICE. An assembly of two independently
operating approved check valves with an automatically operating differential
relief valve between the two check valves, tightly closing shut-off valves on
either side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the
testing of the check and relief valves. The entire assembly shall meet the
design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and city
approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall
operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at a
level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At
the cessation of the normal flow, the pressure between the two check valves
shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device.
In case of leakage of either of the check valves, the differential relief valve
shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved these devices shall be readily
accessible for in-line maintenance and testing and be installed in a location
where no part of the device will be submerged.
   WATER, POTABLE. Any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe
for human consumption.
   WATER, NONPOTABLE. Water which is not safe for human consumption or which is
of question-able potability.
   WATER SERVICE CONNECTION. The terminal end of a service connection from the
public potable water system; i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction
and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's
water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection,
then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There
should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or
backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer's
water system. WATER SERVICE CONNECTION shall also include the water service
connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water
service connections from the public potable water system.
   WATER, USED. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable
water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point
of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.
('66 Code, § 6-7.03) (Ord. 262-C-S, passed 10-10-74)
§ 6-7.04 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Water system.
      (1)   The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts, the
city system and the customer system.
      (2)   The city system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system
under the complete control of the city, from the source of supply up to the
point where the customer's system begins. The source shall include all
components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage,
and delivery of water to the distribution system.
      (3)   The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used
for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system.
      (4)   The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities
beyond the termination of the city distribution system which are utilized in
conveying city-delivered domestic water to points of use.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as
required by state laws and the provisions of this chapter. Service of water to
any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow
prevention device required by state law or by the provisions of this chapter is
not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a back-flow
prevention device has been removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-
connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such
conditions or defects are corrected.
      (2)   The customer's system should be open for inspection at all
reasonable times to authorized representatives of the Maintenance Services
Department to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or
sanitary hazards, including violations of the provisions of this chapter,
exist. When such a condition becomes known, the Director of Maintenance
Services shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by
providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has
corrected the condition in conformance with state and city laws relating to
plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
      (3)   An approved backflow prevention device shall also be installed on
each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or
immediately outside the building being served but, in all cases, before the
first branch line leading off the service line, wherever the following
conditions exist:
         (a)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which
is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is
not acceptable as an additional source by the Director of Community
Development, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from
the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line
appropriate to the degree of hazard.
         (b)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluid or any
other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an
actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow
prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. This
shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the
city systems which have been subject to deterioration in quality.
         (c)   In the case of premises having any internal cross-connection
that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements, or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing a backflow prevention device in the service line.
      (4)   The type of protective device required pursuant to the provisions
of subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of subdivision (3) of this division shall
depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:
         (a)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply as set forth in subdivision (3)(a) of this division, which is not
otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter, the public water system
shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced
pressure principle backflow.
         (b)   In the case of any premises where there is any water or
substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced
into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an
approved double check valve assembly.
         (c)   In the case of any premises where there is any material
dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual
or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall
be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention device. Examples of premises where these
conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage plumbing
stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating
plants.
         (d)   In the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled cross-
connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention device at the service connection.
         (e)   In the case of any premises where, because of security
requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or
impracticable to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public
water system shall be protected against backflow or back-siphonage from the
premises by the installation of a backflow prevention device in the service
line. In this case, maximum protection will be required; that is, an approved
air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device shall be installed in each service to the premises.
      (5)   The following specific types of uses and other uses as designated

            University Park
            Los Angeles, California 90007
         (d)   Testing laboratories other than the laboratory listed above will
be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the City Engineer.
         (e)   Backflow preventers which may be subjected to back pressure or
back-siphonage and which have been fully tested and granted a certificate of
approval by such qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's
current list of “approved devices” may be used without further test or
qualification.
      (7)   It shall be the duty of the city at any premises where backflow
prevention devices are installed to have a certified inspection or operational
test made at least once each year. In those instances where the City Engineer
deems the hazard to be great enough, he may require certified inspections at
more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests may be at the expense of
the water user and shall be performed by the device manufacturer's representa-
tive, by the Maintenance Services Department personnel, or by a certified
tester approved by the City Engineer. It shall be the duty of the Director of
Maintenance Services to see that these timely tests are made. The customer-user
shall be notified by the Director of Maintenance Services in advance when the
tests are to be undertaken so that he or his representative may witness the
tests if it is so desired. Those devices found to be defective shall be
repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user. Records
of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept by the Maintenance Services
Department.
      (8)   All presently installed backflow prevention devices which do not
meet the require-ments of this section but were approved devices for the
purposes described in this chapter at the time of their installation and which
have been properly maintained shall, except for the inspection and maintenance
requirements of subdivision (6) of this division, be excluded from the
requirements of these rules so long as the City Engineer is assured that they
will satisfactorily protect the city system. Whenever the existing device is
moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance, or
when the Director of Maintenance Services finds that the continued maintenance
of such device constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a
backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of this section at the
expense of the customer-user.
   (C)   The City Engineer is hereby authorized and empowered to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.

§ 6-8.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds that:
      (1)   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has determined that
tobacco smoke is the major contributor of particulate indoor air pollution;
      (2)   Reliable studies have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand
smoke is a significant health hazard, in particular for elderly people,
individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway
disease;
      (3)   Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke
include heart disease, lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise
tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction, and
bronchospasm;
      (4)   Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who
suffer other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke may
experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick
leave because of adverse reactions to same;
      (5)   The smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plant, is a danger to
health;
      (6)   The health care costs and lost productivity incurred by smoking-
related disease and death represent a heavy and avoidable financial drain on
our community; and
      (7)   The free distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products is
aimed at encouraging people to begin smoking and using tobacco products and
tempts those who quit smoking to begin smoking again.
   (B)   Purpose. The compelling purpose and intent of this chapter includes,
but is not limited to, promoting the health, safety, and welfare of all people
in the community against the health hazards and harmful effects of the use of
addictive tobacco products.

reduce the threshold to projects that create or replace 10,000 square feet or
more of impervious surface.
   (C)   It is the purpose of the City Council in enacting this chapter to

undertaking the activity, operation or owning and operating the premises shall
comply with the guidelines or requirements.
   (I)   Stormwater pollution prevention plan. The Director may require any
business or utility in the city that is engaged in activities that may result
in non- stormwater discharges or runoff pollutants to develop and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan, which must include an employee training
program. Business activities which may require a stormwater pollution
prevention plan include maintenance, storage, manufacturing, assembly,
equipment operations, vehicle loading, fueling, vehicle maintenance, food
handling or processing or cleanup procedure which is carried out partially or
wholly out of doors.
   (J)   Coordination with Hazardous Material Release Response and Inventory
Plans. Any business subject to the Hazardous Material Release Response and
Inventory Plan (Cal. Health and Safety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.95, §§
25500 et seq.), shall include, in that plan, provision for compliance with this
chapter, including the prohibitions of non- stormwater discharges and the

valid operation and maintenance certificate of compliance certifying to the
inspection of and the proper operation and maintenance of the treatment
measures and other appropriate source control and site design measures. Each
responsible person subject to this requirement shall request an inspection from
the city every 12 months. Upon the filing of the request, and the payment of a
fee covering the cost of inspection, the city shall inspect the property and
shall either issue the certificate upon a determination by the inspector that
all treatment measures and other appropriate source control and site design
measures have been properly maintained and are in good condition, or shall
issue a conditional certificate noting deficiencies that must be corrected
within a time indicated on the certificate, or shall deny the certificate. A
certificate shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. The City
Council may by resolution establish the fee for the inspection and certificate.
   (B)   In lieu of a city inspection, the person may arrange for an inspection
from a private company authorized to conduct inspections by the city. The
company shall use a city-approved inspection form that shall be executed under
penalty of perjury. Should the inspection form establish that the treatment
measures and other appropriate source control and site design measures have
been properly maintained and are in good condition, the city may issue an
operation and maintenance certificate of compliance or the city may at its cost
reinspect the property and proceed as described in division (A) above. The
filing of a false inspection report shall be a misdemeanor.

§ 6-10.01 INTRODUCTION AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city purchases both raw and treated water from the Contra Costa
Water District (CCWD) which the city subsequently treats, distributes and sells
to our residential, commercial and industrial customers. In addition, the city
does have a pre-1914 “non-statutory” appropriative right that allows the city
to take raw water directly from the San Joaquin River when the quality is
determined to be suitable for municipal use. Even under the most favorable
conditions, the city obtains the largest percentage of our raw water from CCWD.
   (B)   CCWD is part of the federal water project, Central Valley Project
(CVP), controlled by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. CCWD is the
largest municipal contractor of the CVP; additionally, the CVP is CCWD's
primary source of untreated water.
   (C)   On March 24, 2009, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2009/24,
declaring a water shortage emergency and directing the preparation of a drought
emergency program ordinance, which was adopted as Ordinance No. 2026-C-S on May
26, 2009 and codified as Chapter 10 of Title 6 of the Antioch Municipal Code.
The focus of the drought management regulations and 15% water reduction goals
would be on reducing outside water use while minimizing impacts on jobs and the
economy, as well as ensuring that the city has the resources to pay any excess
use penalty imposed by CCWD.
   (D)   On June 14, 2011, the Council adopted an Urban Water Management Plan,
which includes Chapter 5.5, "Water Shortage Contingency Plan," that describes
the actions to be taken in the event of various stages of a water supply
shortage.
   (E)   On January 17, 2014, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued Proclamation
No. 1-17-204 declaring a State of Emergency to exist in California due to
severe drought conditions and calling on Californians to reduce their water
usage by 20% which was continued on April 25, 2014 and implemented by
regulations adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board (23 CCR section
863 et seq.). The City Council adopted Resolution No. 2014/79 updating the
City's Drought Management Program and reiterated prohibited activities and
established a 15% voluntary water reduction goal consistent with CCWD's Drought
Management Program established by Resolution No. 14-06.
   (F)   On April 1, 2015, Governor Brown issued Executive Order B-29-15
requiring further water conservation measures including further regulations
from the State Water Resources Control Board applicable to urban water
providers including the city and CCWD.
(Ord. 2026-C-S, passed 5-26-09; Am. Ord. 2102-C-S, passed 5-12-15)
§ 6-10.02 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE.
   By resolution and pursuant to California Water Code § 350 et seq., the City
Council may declare a water shortage and implement drought management
regulations in accordance with state laws, regulations of CCWD, the city's
Urban Water Management Plan or other regulations as needed.
(Ord. 2026-C-S, passed 5-26-09; Am. Ord. 2102-C-S, passed 5-12-15)
§ 6-10.03 ALLOCATION OF WATER.
   A declaration of water shortage may include a mandated reduction amount or
allocation of water.
(Ord. 2026-C-S, passed 5-26-09; Am. Ord. 2102-C-S, passed 5-12-15)
§ 6-10.04 NONESSENTIAL USE OF WATER PROHIBITED.
   (A)   At all times, no person shall use any water provided by the city for a
nonessential purpose.
   (B)   For the purposes of this chapter, each of the following is declared a
nonessential use of water:
      (1)   Permitting water to flow onto a sidewalk, driveway or street, or
escape down a gutter, ditch or other service drain;

with respect to the operations he performs, or the operations performed for him
by contractors or subcontractors, pursuant to the encroachment permit, he carry
public liability and property damage insurance in amounts determined by the

issued. The insurance specified in this section shall be carried by the
permittee at his sole cost and expense and shall remain in effect until all
work required to be performed under the terms of the encroachment permit is
satisfactorily completed. The City Engineer may require such certification as
he deems necessary to substantiate the insurance coverage of the permittee

findings, shall set a fee, after a recommendation from the City Engineer,
consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter, §

whole. The fact that this home is located within the Community Facilities
District does not guarantee that children residing in this home will attend a
school in this or a nearby neighborhood, nor does it guarantee that such
students will attend a school which was constructed with Community Facilities
District funds in whole or in part. The determination of school attendance
boundaries is made by the Antioch Unified School District. Children may be
assigned to any school within the Antioch Unified School District. The
determination to provide busing, and whether there is a fee imposed for such
service, is made by the Antioch Unified School District.

   (B)   This home is located within the Community Facilities District #1989-1,
which collects a special tax to repay bonds for the construction of public
schools and a community park. Located within the community park is the Antioch
WaterPark Aquatics Facility. The special taxes collected from this home are
used only to repay bonds which paid for the construction of the WaterPark.
Operational funds for the WaterPark are paid by the city from other sources,
including admission fees. The buyers of this home are not entitled to free or
reduced fee admission to the WaterPark, although the City Council may, from
time to time, establish reduced rates for property owners within the Community
Facilities District. Whether such reduced rates are offered, and the admissions
fee schedule itself, is in the sole discretion of the Antioch City Council.

   The ordinance codified in this chapter is enacted pursuant to Cal. Gov’t
Code §§ 66000 et seq.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.20 APPLICATION.
   (A)   It is intended that every person who develops or redevelops land in
the city pay development impact fees established by this chapter, as provided
herein.
   (B)   A development impact fee (DIF) is a fee charged in connection with the
issuance of a building permit to defray the cost of certain public facilities
required to serve new development within the city. Except as specifically
provided herein, this chapter does not replace subdivision map exactions or
other measures and exactions required to mitigate site-specific impacts of a
development project; other regulatory, development and processing fees; funding
required pursuant to a development agreement; funds collected pursuant to a
reimbursement agreement for amounts that may exceed a development's share of
public improvement costs; or assessment district proceedings, benefit
assessments, or property taxes.
   (C)   No developer, property owner or other person or entity shall be
eligible to receive a building permit unless such developer, property owner or
other person or entity has first complied with all applicable provisions of
this chapter. The requirements of this chapter shall be imposed prior to the
issuance of each building permit. The city may impose such additional
requirements and conditions on such approvals as are necessary or appropriate
to implement the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.30 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds and declares that:
   (A)   The city provides public services and constructs and maintains public
facilities for the benefit of residents, businesses, and employees within the
city.
   (B)   In 2003, the city adopted the current City of Antioch General Plan,
which includes a Growth Management Element intended to ensure that new
development in the city provides the financial support necessary to allow the
city to supply the desired levels of public services and facilities necessary
to achieve, sustain and continue to promote economic well-being and a high
quality of life in the community.
   (C)   In accordance with its general plan, the city intends to expand and
improve its public facilities to serve new development and to maintain and
improve existing public facilities and the public services provided by the city
that are supported by such public facilities.
   (D)   To implement the General Plan, the city intends to require every
person who develops or redevelops land in the city to mitigate the impacts of
such development or redevelopment on public facilities, by constructing public
facilities in accordance with specific capital improvement programs, or paying
fees that will be used to construct such facilities, or both.
   (E)   The city commissioned and adopted a Development Impact Fee Study ("DIF
Study" or "Study"), which identifies specific public facilities needed to
implement the city's General Plan, the estimated costs of such public
facilities, and various possible fees that, if adopted, could be used to pay
such costs. The Study may be amended from time to time to reflect changed
conditions and circumstances and update and refine the public facilities cost
estimates.
   (F)   The public facilities identified in the Study, as may be amended from
time to time, are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general
welfare, to facilitate orderly urban development, to maintain or enhance
existing levels of service, and to promote economic well-being within the city
as a whole.
   (G)   The fees developed in the Study are based upon the city's
determination that new development and redevelopment generates additional
residents, employees, and structures which in turn place additional cumulative
burdens upon the city's infrastructure, and its adopted policy that such
development and redevelopment should pay its proportionate share of the cost
for new or improved public facilities required to meet such burdens.
   (H)   The public facilities identified in the Study are part of an
integrated system serving and providing benefits to planned development within
the entire city.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)

(Ord. 2154-C-S, passed 9-25-18)
§ 9-3.50 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   General.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an applicant for a
building permit shall pay the following DIFs according and pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this chapter:
      (1)   Administrative facilities fee.
      (2)   Parks and recreation facilities fee.
      (3)   Police facilities fee.
      (4)   Public works facilities fee.
   (B)   The amount of each DIF shall be as established by resolution of the
City Council and shall be set forth in the city's current master fee schedule.
   (C)   The amount of each DIF shall be subject to adjustments based upon
changes in estimated or actual costs including, but not limited to,
construction costs, development schedules, availability of supplemental funds
and other factors. Adjustments of the DIFs may also reflect changes in the
basic infrastructure needs, in estimated revenues received pursuant to this
chapter, as well as the availability or lack thereof of other funds.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.60 CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES (DIFS).
   (A)   Calculation of DIFs. The amount of each DIF assessed on an applicant
for a building permit shall be calculated based on the city’s master fee
schedule in effect at the time of issuance of the building permit.
   (B)   Time for payment of DIFs. All DIFs assessed on an applicant shall be
paid by the applicant at the time of issuance of the building permit.
   (C)   Mixed uses. When a project will include both residential and non-
residential uses, the Director shall determine the DIF amounts by applying to
each use the applicable fee for that individual use and adding the totals of
fees applicable to all of the uses within the project. For example, and by way
of illustration only, a project that contains ten residential units and 20,000
square feet of retail commercial space would pay DIFs in a total amount equal
to the sum of:
      (1)   The total of ten times the amount of each DIF per residential unit;
plus
      (2)   The total of 20,000 times the amount of each DIF per square foot of
retail commercial space.
   (D)   Accessory dwelling units. DIFs shall be collected for accessory
dwelling units as follows:
      (1)   Accessory dwelling units on multifamily properties shall pay the
lesser of the following:
         (a)   The multifamily rate;
         (b)   The product of the following formula:
(Square feet of accessory dwelling unit / Average square feet of all existing
multi-family dwelling units on the same parcel) X Multifamily rate
      (2)   Accessory dwelling units on single- family properties shall pay the
lesser of the following:
         (a)   The multifamily rate;
         (b)   The product of the following formula:
(Square feet of accessory dwelling unit / Square feet of primary dwelling) X
Single-family rate
      (3)   DIFs shall not be collected on accessory dwelling units smaller
than 750 square feet in area.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14; Am. Ord. 2181-C-S, passed 3-24-20)
§ 9-3.70 EXEMPTIONS AND CREDITS.
   (A)   Exemptions. The following projects are exempt from the requirement to
pay DIFs:
      (1)   Demolition of one existing residential structure and the building
of one new residential structure on the same site where no additional dwelling
units are created provided the demolished structure was in use as a residential
dwelling within two years prior to the issuance of the building permit for the
new residential structure.
      (2)   Alteration, remodeling or reconstruction of a nonresidential
structure which does not increase the gross floor area above what was in
existence and in use on the effective date of this chapter.
      (3)   A project which the applicant establishes to the city's
satisfaction will not generate any additional need for public facilities,
services or amenities, or any other impact for which mitigation and/or a fee is
otherwise required. The burden of establishing, by factual proof to the
satisfaction of the Director, the applicability and elements of this subsection
shall be on the applicant. No exemption or limit shall be granted pursuant to
this section unless a finding is made by the Director, based on satisfactory
factual proof provided by the applicant, that the requirements of this section
have been satisfied.
      (4)   There are no other exemptions to the DIF.
   (B)   Credits. The Director may, in conformance with any city credit and
reimbursement policies, grant in favor of an applicant subject to the
requirements of this chapter a credit against the obligation to pay DIFs, as
provided below.
      (1)   For a project that involves the demolition of an existing structure
and the construction of a new structure, the applicant shall be entitled to a
credit in the amount of the applicable DIFs for the structure to be demolished,
provided that such structure has been in use in the past two years, and
provided that no DIF shall be reduced below $0.
      (2)   An applicant may be entitled to a credit against DIFs required by
this chapter to the extent that the applicant constructs, pursuant to city
standards and requirements, public facilities included in the project list used
to determine the amount of the DIFs, as provided below:
         (a)   No credit may be granted unless and until the applicant has
entered into an improvement agreement with the city to construct such public
facilities. The city is not obligated to enter into such improvement agreement
with any applicant.
         (b)   A credit for construction of public facilities shall only apply
to the DIF that would otherwise have been used to fund the construction of such
public facilities.
         (c)   The credit amount shall not exceed the total of the engineering
and construction costs, plus the applicable inflation adjustment, that would be
reasonably incurred by the city in building the public facilities. If the total
adjusted cost of the public facilities exceeds the total value of all the DIFs
due from the applicant and subject to the credit, the applicant may be eligible
for reimbursement of such excess costs from other building permit applicants
whose properties will benefit from the public improvement, in conformance with
any city credit and reimbursement policies. However, under no circumstances
will the city:
            1.   Grant a credit for construction of public facilities that
exceeds the total value of all of the DIFs due from the applicant and subject
to the credit; or
            2.   Be obligated to reimburse an applicant for any costs of
constructing a public facility under an improvement agreement required by §
9-3.70(B)(2)(a).
         (d)   Upon a default under an improvement agreement, the applicant
shall lose all unused DIF credits and shall compensate the city for all used
DIF credits. The amount of the compensation shall be equal to the total of: (i)
100% of the dollar amount of the DIF credits used; plus (ii) accrued interest
from the date that the credit was used, compounded at an annual rate of 6%;
plus (iii) liquidated damages in an amount equal to 20% of the dollar amount of
the DIF credits used. The applicant shall pay the full amount of such
compensation to the city within 30 days of the notice of default under the
improvement agreement.
         (e)   Any credit earned by an applicant shall be applied by city only
to building permits issued for projects specifically described in the
improvement agreement required by §
9-3.70(B)(2)(a) above. Credits may not be transferred to other development
projects unless explicitly approved by the city. The city may establish a
reasonable fee for such transfer via resolution, following issuance of proper
notice required by the Government Code.
      (3)   Credits granted under this chapter may not be combined with other
city credits for oversized water or sanitary sewer utilities.
   (C)   Interest. No interest shall be deemed accrued nor be paid on account
of any claim for award or payment of a credit under this chapter.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.80 AUTHORITY FOR ADDITIONAL MITIGATION.
   Except as expressly provided herein, DIFs collected pursuant to this chapter
do not replace existing development fees, including but not limited to the fees
required under Title 7, Chapter 5 and Title 9, Chapter 4, Article 10 of this
Code, specific area development impact fees, school impact fees, and utility
demand fees or connection charges, nor do such DIFs limit requirements or
conditions to provide site-specific mitigation of site-specific impacts imposed
on development projects as part of normal development review and approval
processes.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.90 ANNUAL FINDINGS.
   Each year, on or before July 1, the City Council shall make the findings
described in Cal. Gov’t Code § 66001(d)(1) for unexpended fees collected
pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.100 REVIEW OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM.
   The Capital Improvement Plan Construction Program provides a general
expression of the improvements needed to meet General Plan level of service
standards and other established infrastructure needs. The improvements may be
changed from time to time reflecting current conditions, and at least once
every five years, the City Council shall conduct a comprehensive review the
City of Antioch's Capital Improvement Plan Construction Program referenced in
the DIF Study and increase or decrease the amount of the DIFs established by
this chapter based on updated project costs, project needs and available
alternative revenue sources and other economic considerations.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.110 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   An applicant may apply to the Director of Community Development for an
adjustment to one or more of the DIFs assessed pursuant to this chapter. The
following procedure shall be used to consider such an application:
   (A)   The application shall be in writing and filed with the Director no
later than ten days before the public hearing on the first approval required
for the project that is subject to the requirements of this chapter, or if no
public hearing is required, ten days before submittal of the application for a
building permit. The application shall state in detail the factual and legal
basis for the requested adjustment(s).
   (B)   The Director shall consider the application at a meeting with the
applicant within 30 days after the filing of the application. The applicant
bears the burden of proof in presenting substantial evidence to support the
application. The applicant must present evidence, in the form of technical
information, to show that a DIF, or the amount of a DIF, is inappropriate for
the particular development, which evidence shall be comparable in detail to the
technical information found in the Development Impact Fee Study.
   (C)   The Director shall consider the following factors to determine whether
or not to approve any adjustment to a DIF:
      (1)   The proposed use of the DIF;
      (2)   The characteristics of the development project which is the subject
of this review procedure;
      (3)   The appropriate land use category for the development project which
is the subject of this review procedure;
      (4)   The relationships between:
         (a)   The use of the DIF and the nature of the project;
         (b)   The need for the public improvements funded by the DIF and the
nature of the project; and
         (c)   The costs of the public improvements funded by the DIF and the
portion of such costs attributable to the DIFs that would normally be assessed
on the project.
      (5)   Whether the DIF is reasonably related in extent to the likely
impacts of the proposed development project.
   (D)   The Director is authorized to reduce the amount of a DIF based upon
the determination made pursuant to this section.
   (E)   The decision of the Director shall be appealable to the City Manager
pursuant to §
9-3.120 of this chapter.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)

city.
   (E)   Sections
9-3.110 and
9-3.120 provide an administrative remedy which must be exhausted prior to
compliance with the procedure provided in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 66020 and 66021.
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.130 REFUND OF FEES.
   (A)   If a building permit expires, is canceled, or is voided without the
permitted construction thereunder having occurred, and any DIFs paid pursuant
to this chapter have not been expended, the Director shall, upon the written
request of the applicant, order the refund of all DIFs actually paid by the
applicant, except for administrative facilities fees, which shall not be
subject to any refunds. A written refund request shall only be honored if
actually received by the Director within a period of one year from the date of
the expiration, cancellation, or voiding of the building permit(s) for which
the DIFs were paid. Following the expiration of the one year period, no refunds
shall be granted on the basis of expired, cancelled or voided permits or
approvals. If a partial refund is granted under the provisions of this section,
the property involved shall be credited with the amount paid but not refunded
against any similar DIFs due for the same or subsequent use.

9-3.120 of this chapter, the City Council shall make the findings required by
Cal. Gov’t Code § 60001 (or any successor statute) with respect to any DIF
revenue not expended five years or more after it was paid. If the City Council
cannot make the required findings, it shall authorize a refund of the
unexpended DIF revenue to the then current record owner of the property for
which the DIF was paid, or otherwise allocate the unexpended revenues, as
provided in Cal. Gov’t Code § 66001 (or any successor statute).
(Ord. 2079-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-3.140 ANNUAL REVIEW.

   Whenever the Subdivision Map Act, the provisions of this chapter, or any
resolution of the Council or the Commission require the installation of sewers,
water lines, drainage facilities, or other improvements by a subdivider and
such improvements are of benefit and value to other land than that located
within the subdivision, the Commission, after consultation with the department
involved, may recommend to the Council an agreement with the subdivider to
reimburse him in whole or in part for the use of such improvements by other
lands than those developed by the subdivider. The Commission may recommend to
the Council the imposition and collection of a charge for the use of such
facilities as provided in Article 6 of the Subdivision Map Act.

ARTICLE 10: REGULATIONS FOR THE DEDICATION OF LAND, THE PAYMENT OF FEES, OR
BOTH, FOR PARK AND RECREATIONAL LANDS
§ 9-4.1001 PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this article are enacted pursuant to the authority granted
by Cal. Gov't Code § 66477. The park and recreational facilities for which the
dedication of land and/or the payment of a fee is required by the provisions of
this article are in accordance with the Environmental Resource Management
Element of the General Plan.
('66 Code, § 9-4.1001) (Ord. 561-C-S, passed 1-19-84)
§ 9-4.1002 REQUIREMENTS.
   As a condition of approval of a final subdivision map, the subdivider shall
dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the city,
for park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards
and formula set forth in this article.
('66 Code, § 9-4.1002) (Ord. 561-C-S, passed 1-19-84)
§ 9-4.1003 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   The Council finds that the population of the city as shown in the most
recent available federal census is 102,365, and the amount of existing
neighborhood and community park, trails, and recreation facilities as of the
date of the most recent available census is 611 acres. The ratio of park area
is therefore 6.0 acres per 1,000 members of the population. Pursuant to Cal.
Gov’t Code § 66477, the Council hereby establishes the standard for park
dedication at 5.0 acres per 1,000 persons residing within a subdivision.
(‘66 Code, § 9-4.1003) (Ord. 561-C-S, passed 1-19-84; Am. Ord. 682-C-S, passed
7-14-87; Am. Ord. 796-C-S, passed 10-9-90; Am. Ord. 797-C-S, passed 11-22-90;
Am. Ord. 2080-C-S, passed 3-25-14)
§ 9-4.1004 STANDARDS AND FORMULA FOR THE DEDICATION OF LAND.
   The proportion of a subdivision to be dedicated or the amount of fees to be
paid in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined according
to the formula set forth in this section. The table for determining dedication
shall be based on the following formula: the average number of persons per
dwelling unit multiplied by the standard of 5.0 acres per 1,000 persons equals
the required number of acres per dwelling unit. The following table, based upon
such formula, shall be followed:
 
Unit Category           Average Person/DU Average Requirement/ DU
Single-family, detached 3.0               0.015
Single-family, attached 2.2               0.011
Duplexes                1.9               0.0095
Multi-family            1.9               0.0095
Senior housing          1.5               0.0075
 
(Ord. 2154-C-S, passed 9-25-18)
§ 9-4.1005 FEE DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Formula determination. The Council finds that the fees established by
§
9-4.1007 of this article represents the value of the land prescribed for
dedication in §
9-4.1004 of this article.
   (B)   Fees in lieu of land; 50 parcels or less. If the proposed subdivision
contains 50 parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay the fee established by §
9-4.1007 of this article, rather than having to dedicate land; except that when
a condominium project, stock cooperative, or community apartment project, as
those terms are defined in Cal. Civil Code §§ 4105, 4125 and 4190, exceeds 50
dwelling units, dedication of land may be required, at the option of the city.
   (C)   Use of money. The moneys collected pursuant to the provisions of this
article shall be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating
existing park or recreation facilities to serve a subdivision.
(‘66 Code, § 9-4.1005) (Ord. 561-C-S, passed 1-19-84; Am. Ord. 2080-C-S, passed
3-25-14)
§ 9-4.1006 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING BOTH THE DEDICATION OF LAND AND THE PAYMENT
OF FEES.
   (A)   When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed in the
Park and Recreation Element of the General Plan as the site for a park, such
portion shall be dedicated for park purposes. The value of such dedication
shall be a credit against the fees required for any additional land which would
have been required to be dedicated pursuant to §
9-4.1004 of this article.
   (B)   When a major part of the park or recreational site has already been
acquired by the city, and only a small portion of land is needed from the
subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated,
and the value of such dedication shall be a credit against the fees which
otherwise would have been required to be paid. Fees collected shall be used for
the improvement of the existing park and recreational facility or for the
improvement of other parks and recreational facilities serving the subdivision.
('66 Code, § 9-4.1006) (Ord. 561-C-S, passed 1-19-84)
§ 9-4.1007 AMOUNT OF FEES IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATIONS.
   The Council finds that the average land value for improved residential land
is $100,000 per acre. Therefore, the amount of fees required to be paid in lieu
of land dedication shall be the following amounts:
 
Type of Unit            Fee Per Dwelling Unit
Single-family, detached $1,500
Single-family, attached $1,100
Duplexes                $950
Multi-family            $950
Mobile home             $950
Senior housing          $750
 
(Ord. 2154-C-S, passed 9-25-18)
§ 9-4.1008 DETERMINATIONS OF THE DEDICATION OF LAND OR THE PAYMENT OF FEES.
   Whether the city accepts the dedication of land or elects to require the
payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined
by the consideration of the following:
   (A)   The Environmental Resource and Land Use Elements of the General Plan;
   (B)   Any adopted Specific Plan for the area;
   (C)   The topography, geology, access, and location of land in the
subdivision available for dedication;
   (D)   The size and shape of the subdivision and the land available for
dedication;
   (E)   The feasibility of dedication;
   (F)   The compatibility of dedication with the General Plan and Specific
Plan, if any; and
   (G)   The availability of previously acquired park property. The
determination of the city as to whether land shall be dedicated or whether a
fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive.
('66 Code, § 9-4.1008) (Ord. 561-C-S, passed 1-19-84)
§ 9-4.1009 CREDIT FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   If the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to the
dedicated land, the value of the improvements, together with any equipment
located thereon, shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of
land required by this article.

acres of contiguous private open space or private recreational facilities shall
be provided before any credit shall be given. A maximum credit of six and
three-fourths acres shall be allowable for such private open space or private
recreational facilities.
   (D)   To be eligible for credit for private recreation improvements, the
following standards shall be met:
      (1)   That yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required to
be maintained by the zoning and building laws and regulations shall not be
included in the computation of such private open space;
      (2)   That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or
restrictions;
      (3)   That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of
the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated
without the consent of the city or its successor;
      (4)   That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for
use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors
as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location;
      (5)   That the facilities proposed for open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the Park and Recreation Element of the
General Plan of the city; and
      (6)   That the open space for which credit is given is a minimum of two
acres and provides a minimum of four of the following Local Park Basic Elements
or a combination of such and other recreational improvements which will meet

   FLOODPLAIN COMBINING DISTRICTS, FP-1 (FLOODWAY) AND FP-2 (FLOOD FRINGE).
These are established to regulate land uses within areas subject to inundation
as designated on the FIRM. The regulations in such districts shall apply in
addition to the regulations of the zone district with which the FP District is
combined. The provisions of the FP Districts shall govern in such cases where
the regulations conflict and cannot be reasonably reconciled between an FP
District and the district with which it is combined.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and

point.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including the
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for the
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this article.

and shall mean the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement
was within 180 calendar days of the permit date. ACTUAL START shall mean either
the first placement of the permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. PERMANENT CONSTRUCTION shall
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor shall
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor shall it include
excavations for basements, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor shall it include the installation on the property of

addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure either before the improvement
or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being
restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition,
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building commences, whether
or not such alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT, however, shall not include either any project for the
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions, or any alteration of a "historic structure," provided
that the alternation will not preclude the structure's continued use as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this article which
variance permits construction in a manner which would otherwise be prohibited
by this article.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or
other evidence of compliance required by this article shall be presumed to be
in violation until such time as such documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. Any stream, river, creek, ditch, channel, canal, slough,
conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, or swale.
('66 Code, § 9-4.2003) (Ord. 708-C-S, passed 5-12-88; Am. Ord. 2025-C-S, passed
5-12-09)
§ 9-4.2004 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in the "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Contra Costa County, California,
and Incorporated Areas" dated June 16, 2009 with an accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM's) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM's),
dated June 16, 2009, and all subsequent and/or revision, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this article. Such Flood Insurance Study
is on file in the Department of Public Works. This FIS and attendant mapping is
the minimum area of applicability of this article and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow the implementation of this article and
which are recommended to the city by the Floodplain Administrator. The study,
FIRM's and FBFM's are on file at the Community Development Department,
Engineering Division, 200 "H" Street, Antioch, CA 94531-5007.
   (C)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this article and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions
of this article by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing set forth in this article
shall prevent the Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.
   (D)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easement, covenant, or deed
restriction. However, where this article and another law, easement, covenant,
or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
   (E)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other power granted under
state statutes.
   (F)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part
of the city, or any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance
Administration, for any flood damage which results from reliance on this
article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (G)   Severability. This article and the various parts thereof are hereby
declared to be severable. Should any section of this article be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of this article as a whole, or any portion thereof, other than the
section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

   (C)   In passing upon such applications, the Commission shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this article, the provisions of Article 6 of Chapter 5 of this
title, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damages and the effect of such damages on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of floods for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
      (10)    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
      (11)    The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including the maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, streets, and
bridges.
   (D)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level provided all the standards specified in this section
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance shall increase.
   (E)   Upon the consideration of the factors and the purposes of this
article, the Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon
request.
('66 Code, § 9-4.2012) (Ord. 708-C-S, passed 5-12-88)
§ 9-4.2013 VARIANCES; CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set
forth in this section.
   (B)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or the victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided the provisions of this section are
satisfied and the structure or other development is protected by methods which
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threat to
the public safety.
   (F)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risks to life and property
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall
be recorded by the Commission in the office of the County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that the notice appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.

         (b)   Foster convenient, harmonious, and workable relationships among
land uses; and
         (c)   Achieve an orderly arrangement of land uses as described in the

      (3)   Ensure the provision of adequate open space for light, air, and the
fire safety for all structures.
      (4)   Promote the development of office, commercial, industrial, and
related land uses that are consistent with the General Plan in order to
strengthen the city's economic base.
      (5)   Conserve and enhance the city's archi-tectural and cultural
resources.
      (6)   Conserve and enhance key visual features of the city's setting,
including creeks and undeveloped hillsides and ridgelines, consistent with the
General Plan.
      (7)   Provide adequate off-street parking and loading facilities and
promote a safe, effective traffic circulation system.
      (8)   Ensure that the service demands of new development will not exceed
the capacities of existing streets, utilities, or public services, including

            7.   It shall be the responsi-bility of each management company to
ensure that the sign structures under its control are well-maintained and not
allowed to become unsightly. Noncompliance will be reported to the respective
management company for correction within 14 days and if the situation is not
improved, the city shall have the right to remove the sign structure at the
management company's expense.
            8.   A refundable cash deposit in the amount to be determined by
the City Engineer but not to exceed $200 per sign shall be posted with the city
in order to ensure removal of off-site signage within 14 days of the closing of
the subdivision's model home complex. If the signage is not completely removed

remove the signage and deduct the cost of removal from the cash deposit.
Additional removal costs shall be charged to the developer.
            9.   No more than two building permits for individual sign

to assure adequate visibility. The maximum square footage for any additional
on-site signage shall not exceed 50 square feet per sign.

within the 14-day period stipulated above, the city shall have the right to
remove the signage and deduct the cost of removal from the cash deposit.
Additional removal costs shall be charged to the developer.
            4.   It shall be the responsibility of each developer to ensure

chapter, the City Council shall have the discretion to enter into any
contractual relationship or franchise agreement with any individual or
organization for the provision of bus shelters which may feature advertising
signs. Such signs shall be exempt from the regulations contained in this
chapter, but shall be regulated by the terms of the contractual agreements or
franchise. The City Council finds, in adopting this section, that advertising
signs are commonly found in bus shelters, and thus are an exception to its
other regulations which generally prohibit advertising signs from being
displayed in the public right-of-way.
   (C)   Billboards.  BILLBOARD shall mean an outdoor advertising sign that is

determined by the Department of Development Services.
         (e)   Off-site signs shall be located only on private property and
then only with the owner's written permission.
         (f)   Such signs shall not be attached to any utility pole, fence,

(Ord. 918-C-S, passed 5-28-96; Am. Ord. 2225-C-S, passed 2-28-23)

   (A)   Maximum sign area. The maximum allowable sign area shall be 150 square
feet.
   (B)   Signs permitted and prohibited.
      (1)   Signs shall be permitted as provided for in each zoning
classification which permits service station uses, except as provided in this
article.
      (2)   No sign shall face or be placed in any residential street providing
secondary access to such service station use.
      (3)   No sign shall be attached to light standards.
      (4)   Two permanent reader panels for the purpose of designating the

(Ord. 918-C-S, passed 5-28-96)
§ 9-5.517 HISTORICAL SIGNS.
   Any sign which may be of historical value, at the request of the Council,
Planning Commission, Design Review Board, Zoning Administrator, staff, or an
interested citizen, shall be referred to and reviewed by the Civic Historical-
Cultural Committee for its recommendation to the Design Review Board. The
Design Review Board shall make the determination of whether the sign is of
historical value. If it is determined the sign is of significant historical
value to the city, it may be excepted from the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 918-C-S, passed 5-28-96)
§ 9-5.518 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   (A)   Temporary sign defined.  TEMPORARY SIGN shall mean any sign, handbill,
or poster which is placed to advertise or announce a specific event, or which
pertains to a particular event or occurrence, or which is not designed or
intended to be placed permanently. Examples of temporary signs include, but are
not limited to, signs, handbills, or posters relating to garage sales,
political candidates or ballot measures, concerts, “swap meets,” and the like.
   (B)   Legislative findings. The Council finds as follows:
      (1)   Aside from this section, temporary signs are not regulated by this
article and are therefore not subject to design review or approval as to their
size, shape, color, design, or placement. The lack of regulation of temporary
signs has in the past led to visual clutter within the community and aesthetic
blight. At times, temporary signs pose traffic safety hazards.
      (2)   Property and facilities located within the public right-of-way,
such as utility poles, benches, hydrants, bridges, sidewalks, and similar
structures, are not by tradition or designation a forum for communication by
the general public, and the Council wishes to preserve such structures for
their intended purposes, which is the safe, efficient, and pleasant movement of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic and the operation of utility systems.
      (3)   The regulations and prohibitions specified in this section are
necessary to preserve items located within the public right-of-way for their
intended purposes and to prevent the visual clutter, blight, and traffic safety
hazards caused by temporary signs therein.
   (C)   Posting prohibited. No person shall paint, mark, write on, post or
otherwise affix, erect, construct, maintain, paste, nail, tack, or otherwise
fasten or affix any temporary sign on any sidewalk, crosswalk, curb, street
lamp post, pole, bench, hydrant, tree, shrub, bridge, or electric light or
power or telephone wire pole, or wire appurtenance thereof, or upon any street
sign or traffic sign, or upon any other object located within the public right-
of-way which is not maintained for the purpose of communications by temporary
signs by the general public.
   (D)   Exceptions. This section shall not prevent a public officer or
employee from posting notices as required by law, such as notices of street
abandonment or notices of proposed assessment district proceedings, as required
by the Streets and Highways Code of the state or other statutory authority.
This section shall also not prevent the Director of Public Works from issuing
an encroachment permit for the erection of banners pertaining to noncommercial
and nonpolitical community events, such as parades, fairs, and community
celebrations. This section shall also not pertain to structures located within
the right-of-way which by tradition or designation are used for the purpose of
communication by the general public. Such structures shall include kiosks,
bulletin boards, benches upon which advertising is authorized, newspaper racks,
and billboards as authorized by this Code.
   (E)   Sign distance. No temporary sign over three feet in height located on
private property shall be erected or placed at the intersection of any street
or within the segment created by drawing an imaginary line between points 50
feet back from where the curb lines of the intersection quadrant intersect.

   (F)   Removal.
      (1)   Temporary signs not prohibited by this section shall be removed
within 14 calendar days after the event to which they relate occurs.
      (2)   Any temporary sign posted or otherwise affixed in violation of this
section may be removed by officers of the Police, Building Inspection, or
Public Works Departments or by the Code Enforcement Officer. Signs removed by
city employees shall be taken to the Maintenance Service Center. The employee
removing the sign shall immediately attempt to notify the owner of the sign, if
such can be ascertained. In cases where a sign contains the name of a printing
firm or political candidate, the Department shall also immediately attempt to
notify such firm or candidate of the fact of removal, the location of the sign,
and the procedure for retrieving the sign.
   (G)   Retrieval of signs. Any person desiring to retrieve a sign removed by
the city may do so upon the payment of an administrative fine as specified by
resolution. In lieu of paying such administrative fine, such person may
retrieve a sign upon signing a promise to appear upon a citation issued to him
or her for the violation of this section. If a person wishes to contest the
fact that a sign was placed in violation of this section prior to paying the
fine or signing the citation, he or she shall have the right to an
administrative hearing before the Director of Public Works. If the Director of
Public Works finds that the sign was lawfully posted, he shall return the sign
without an administrative penalty or the issuance of a citation.
   (H)   Destruction of signs. Any temporary sign removed by the city may be
considered abandoned if it is not retrieved within 15 calendar days after the
date of such removal and may be disposed of by the city without liability
therefor to any person.
(Ord. 918-C-S, passed 5-28-96)
§ 9-5.519 TOBACCO-RELATED SIGNS.
   (A)   Window signs, freestanding signs, shingle signs, temporary signs,
awning and canopy signs, business opening signs, portable off-site signs, wall
signs, gasoline service station signs and commercial logo flags which advertise
or promote tobacco products are prohibited when located within 1,600 feet of an
elementary or secondary school, public playground or playing field when visible
from the public street or sidewalk. No part of this ordinance shall be
construed to regulate messages which do not propose or infer a commercial
message.
   (B)   No sign, banner, flag or any other display which advertises or
promotes tobacco products shall be permitted on any city-owned facility.
   (C)   In order to allow the terms of this ordinance to become known to the
persons affected by it, this ordinance shall not be formally enforced by use of
the provisions contained in it until 1-2-00.

a   Where 40% or more of the frontage (excluding reversed frontage lots) in a block has
been improved with buildings, the minimum required front yard for main buildings shall
be the average of the improved lots if less than the front yard requirements, but not
less than six feet from the property line.
b   Height shall mean the vertical distance from the average level of the highest and
lowest point of that portion of the lot covered by the structure, excluding below
ground basements, to the topmost point of the roof. Exceptions to the specified height
limitation shall include the spires, belfries, cupolas and domes of churchesreligious
facilities (e.g., churches, mosques, temples), monuments, water towers, fire and hose
towers, observation towers, distribution and transmission towers, lines and poles,
chimneys, smokestacks, flag poles, radio towers, excluding wireless communications
facilities subject to § 9-5.3846, equipment penthouses encompassing less than 20% of
total roof area and less than eight feet in height, and parapets less than 30 inches in
height, unless otherwise governed by this chapter.
c   Minimum lot area in all zones shall not apply to the condominium parcelization of a
larger project where land is being divided for individual building envelopes.
d   Maximum density allowed is defined in the city General Plan as per the maximum
developable gross acreage definition found in this chapter.
e   For at least 25% of the lots in a given subdivision, one side yard of an interior
lot shall be 10 feet in width and the other side yard can be five feet. The 10-foot
side yard area shall remain as unrestricted open area. This shall also apply to all
two-story single-family residential lots. On any parcel of land of an average width of
less than 50 feet, which parcel was under one ownership or is shown as a lot on any
subdivision map filed in the office of the County Recorder prior to April 11, 1950,
when the owner thereof owns no adjoining land, the width of each side yard may be
reduced to 10% of the width of such parcel, but in no case to less than three feet.
f   Front yard and street side setbacks shall be reserved for landscaping only,
excluding access and egress driveways and shall be determined on a graduated scale
based upon type of street and land use as follows:
      (1)   Non-residential uses.
         Arterial street: minimum 30-foot setback with 30-foot landscaping on all
frontages.
         Collector street: minimum 25-foot setback with 25-foot landscaping.
         Local street: minimum 20-foot setback with 20-foot landscaping.
      (2)   Single-family detached and two-family dwelling uses.
         Arterial street: minimum 30-foot setback with 30-foot landscaping on all
frontages.
         Collector street: minimum 25-foot setback and landscaping for front yard and
10-foot street side yard setback with landscaping
         Local street: minimum 20-foot front yard setback with 20 foot of landscaping
and 10-foot street side yard setback with landscaping.
      (3)   Multi-family dwelling uses.
         Arterial street: minimum 15-foot setback with 15-foot landscaping on all
frontages.
         Collector street: minimum 15-foot setback with 15-foot landscaping.
         Local street: minimum 10-foot setback with 10-foot landscaping.
\g   New construction with frontage in excess of the minimum lot width shall reflect
the pattern of building widths in facade design.
h   Within the area bounded by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, “I” Street,
Second Street, and “E” Street, residential density may be increased to 45 dwelling
units per acre provided:
      (1)   The residential use is part of a mixed use development with the entire
first floor devoted to commercial use;
      (2)   The proposed development provides public amenities as described in § 4
(relating to residential use in RTC); and
      (3)   The project has received use permit approval from the Planning Commission.
i   Buildings in the RTC district shall be placed on the property line except for:
      (1)   Setbacks to accommodate outdoor dining and plazas, provided that such
setbacks do not exceed a depth of one-third of the lot depth;
      (2)   Courtyards, promenades, and plazas located on any portion of the site; and
      (3)   Where a setback is necessary to maintain the uniform setback of building
facades.
j   The first floor of a building shall extend from property line to property line
except:
      (1)   In setback areas for outdoor dining, plazas; and
      (2)   For required vehicular or pedestrian access.
k   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter for yard requirements, in any
residential district the front of any garage shall be not less than 20 feet from the
exterior property line on which such garage faces.
l   For projects that consist of attached single-family dwellings (townhomes), in which
each dwelling occupies its own lots, the minimum lot area is 1,800 square feet and the
minimum required interior side setback is zero.
m   Where a multi-family dwelling abuts a lot that is zoned RR, RE, R4 or R6, a minimum
rear yard of 20 feet shall be provided.
 
§ 9-5.602 LEGALLY ESTABLISHED YARD SETBACKS.
   On any property line where there is a legally established side or rear yard
building setback line less than that required by the standards established by
this chapter, that setback may be continued when expanding a structure for a
use permitted by the zoning district in which the property is located, provided
maximum lot coverage is not exceeded and all other required setbacks apply.
This provision is not applicable to proposed expansions in front yard setbacks.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.603 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   (A)   (1)   In residential districts, the maximum allowable height is 15
feet for accessory structures. Detached accessory structures shall be located
behind the required front yard setback and cover no more than 40% of the rear
yard area required for the main building. The minimum side yard for accessory
structures is 20 feet on corner lots and five feet on interior lots. A five-
foot rear yard setback is required, unless the property is a double-frontage
lot in which case a ten foot rear yard setback is required.
      (2)   Exception. Portable storage sheds are exempt from setback
requirements when placed in the rear yard. The required minimum setback from
the front property line and/or street side yard property lines (for corner
lots) must be maintained. A shed is considered portable when it meets the
following criteria and does not need a building permit:
         (a)   Freestanding, moveable, and has no permanent foundation.
         (b)   Less than 120 square feet in area.
         (c)   Building height no greater than eight feet.
         (d)   Does not contain plumbing or electrical installations.
   (B)   In the event an accessory building is attached to the main building,
it shall be considered structurally a part of the main building and shall
comply in all respects with the requirements of this chapter applicable to the
main building. Unless so attached, an accessory building in a residential
district shall be at least five feet from any dwelling building existing or
under construction on the same lot or any adjacent lot. In the case of a corner
lot adjacent to a reversed frontage lot, accessory buildings shall not project

ARTICLE 7: MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL OBJECTIVE DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 9-5.701 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   Multi-Family Objective Design Standards apply to residential mixed use and
multiple-family dwellings in any district in which they are permitted or
conditionally permitted, except for projects in the CIH Overlay, which are
subject to §
9-5.3848 Commercial Infill Housing Overlay District regulations, and cottage
communities in the IH Overlay, which are subject to §
9-5.3850 Innovative Housing Overlay District regulations. Multi-Family
Objective Design Standards shall be adopted by resolution and may be amended
from time to time. The purpose of these regulations is to promote high-quality
design and provide a pleasant residential environment within the context of
higher-density development; ensure the provision of amenities for residents of
multi-family developments; foster pedestrian access; and create visually
attractive street frontages that offer architectural and landscape interest.

   The Planning Commission may allow modifications to the dimensional
requirements, design standards, and other requirements of the Multi-Family
Objective Design Standards and IH Overlay District regulations when so doing is
consistent with the purposes of the General Plan and the district and would,
because of practical difficulties, topography, and similar physical conditions,
result in better design, environmental protection, and land use planning. The
Zoning Administrator may review and approve modifications that are requested
because a lot is substandard. All other modifications shall require Planning
Commission approval. All modifications under this section shall be processed as
use permits pursuant to the procedures of Article 27 of this Code.
   (A)   Required findings for approval. In addition to any findings required

area or specific plan.
      (2)   The modification meets the intent and purpose of the applicable
zone district and is in substantial compliance with the district regulations.
      (3)   The modification is necessary due to the physical characteristics
of the property and the proposed use or structure or other circumstances,
including, but not limited to, topography, noise exposure, irregular property
boundaries, or other unusual circumstance including the architectural or
historical significance of the structure, and building or site features that
will demonstrably reduce use of nonrenewable energy resources or greenhouse gas
emissions.
      (4)   There are no alternatives to the requested modification that could
provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant with less potential
detriment to surrounding owners and occupants or to the general public.
      (5)   The granting of the requested modification will not be detrimental
to the health or safety of the public or the occupants of the property or
result in a change in land use or density that would be inconsistent with the
requirements of this chapter.
      (6)   If the modification is requested because it will result in superior
or more sustainable design, the review authority must also make the following
findings:
         (a)   The proposed design is of superior quality or is intended to
incorporate features that would demonstrably reduce use of nonrenewable energy
resources or greenhouse gas emissions;
         (b)   The structure is an existing residential building and the
alteration or addition is intended to increase the habitability and function of
the structure, is compatible with the existing neighborhood character, will not
substantially interfere with the privacy, sunlight, or air available to
neighboring residential uses; and
         (c)   The proposed design has been reviewed and approved pursuant to
Article 26: Design Review Duties and Responsibilities, of this chapter.

of review conducted in compliance with the California Environmental Quality
Act.
   (C)   Appeals, expiration, extensions, and modifications.
      (1)   Appeals. The applicant or any other aggrieved party may appeal a
decision on a modification in the same manner as a use permit as provided for
in Article 27, Design Review, Use Permits, Administrative Use Permits and
Variances.
      (2)   Expiration, extensions, and modifications. Modifications granted
under this chapter are effective and may only be extended or modified as
provided for in Article 27.
   (D)   Applicability. These procedures are not applicable to a project that
is entitled to a density bonus concession or waiver pursuant to Article 34,
Senior Housing Overlay District, or Article 35, Density Bonus Program, of this
Code and may not be used to approve an increase in maximum density or reduction
in required parking or to approve a use that is not permitted on the site
proposed for development.

   (A)   It is the purpose of this section to regulate the removal of protected
trees on developed property, when such removal is not associated with a regular
development application.
   (B)   Such requests are typically related to routine maintenance and/or re-
landscaping.
      (1)   Application required. An application shall be made in writing on a
form furnished by the Department of Parks, Leisure and Community Services and
shall be accompanied by the following information:
         (a)   A sketch showing the location(s), size (in diameter and
approximate height), and species of tree(s).
         (b)   The applicant and/or property owner's name, address and
telephone number.
         (c)   The name of the company or individual designated to remove the
tree(s), their address, phone number (and business license number if
applicable).
      (2)   Decision regarding permit application.
         (a)   Time of decision. The Department of Parks, Leisure and Community
Services shall render a decision regarding the permit application within 10
working days after filing of a complete application.
         (b)   Criteria. In deciding whether to issue a permit, the Department
of Parks, Leisure and Community Services shall consider the following criteria:
            1.   The condition of the tree(s) with respect to its health,
proximity to existing structure(s), and the likelihood of future damage to said
structure(s) and nearby utilities should the tree(s) not be removed.
            2.   The necessity to remove the tree(s) for reasonable use and/or
enjoyment of the property.
            3.   The aesthetic impacts of tree removal in relation to the size
and species of the subject and nearby tree(s). Typically the city will
encourage the preservation of uniform street tree patterns where such patterns
have long been estab-lished.
      (3)   Requirement for street tree replace-ment. In allowing for the
removal of a street tree, the Department of Parks, Leisure and Community
Services will require that a replacement street tree be planted. The property
owner may select the species of the replacement tree, with tree selection
subject to city approval.
      (4)   Special concern for landmark trees. Applications to remove landmark
trees as defined by this section will require the mailed noticing of said
application to all adjacent property owners. Decisions on landmark trees are to
be made by the tree committee, which shall provide a 10 day comment period to
allow neighbors to respond to the notice.
      (5)   Appeal. A person aggrieved or affected by the decision of the
Department of Parks, Leisure and Community Services may ask that the city's
standing Tree Committee, as defined by this chapter, review the permit
applications. Should the Tree Committee not grant the permission to remove the
tree(s), a further appeal may be filed with the Board of Administrative Appeals
pursuant to §
1-4.01 of this code.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.1204 RESTRICTIONS ON REMOVAL OF ESTABLISHED TREES FROM UNDEVELOPED
PROPERTY.
   (A)   The city discourages the removal of trees from undeveloped property as
defined by this chapter.
   (B)    Over the past years, the city has needlessly lost many valuable
established trees that could have been incorporated into proposed developments
had the tree(s) not been previously removed.
      (1)   Special circumstances to allow tree removal. Unless the subject
established tree(s) is deemed to cause imminent potential harm to the public,
neighboring property, and/or adjacent streets and utilities if it is not
removed, decisions regarding potential tree removal are to be deferred to the
time of regular development application. Should a property owner wish to remove
a tree(s) from undeveloped property, an application shall be submitted to the
Department of Parks, Leisure and Community Services as described in this
chapter.
      (2)   Tree Committee review of all applica-tions on undeveloped property.
All applications concerning trees on undeveloped property shall be reviewed by
the Tree Committee as defined by this chapter. Factors to be considered are the
trees' age, size, and the presence of imminent risks as documented by a
certified arborist. The city may commission a certified arborist, at the
applicant's expense, to provide information on the health of the tree.
Typically, healthy trees may not be removed from undeveloped property.
      (3)   Special concern for landmark trees. Applications for removal of
landmark trees as defined by this section shall be subject to the same noticing
requirement as is required for a use permit.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.1205 ESTABLISHED TREE PRESERVATION AND/OR REMOVAL IN CONJUNCTION WITH
PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT.
   It is the purpose of this section to encourage the preservation of existing
trees and outline the conditions which allow for the removal of trees in
conjunction with property development.
   (A)   Request for tree removal incorporated into regular development
application. If any established trees are on the subject property, the
following information shall be provided with the regular development
application.
      (1)   A site plan showing the existing topography with location of all
established trees, clearly labeling those trees which are proposed for either
saving or removal.
      (2)   A description of all established trees on the property, including
the size (in diameter), estimated height, species, and relative condition
(i.e., healthy vs. in decline).
      (3)   A written statement requesting permission to remove the subject
tree(s) providing the reason for the request.
   (B)   Action on tree removal request by decision-making body. Approval or
denial of the tree removal request will be made as part of the regular develop-
ment application process. As part of the dis-cretionary project review process,
the decision-making body may require the preservation of a tree proposed for
removal and conversely may condition the removal of a tree. Decisions to
preserve and/or remove will be based on the following factors:
      (1)   The highest priority will be placed on the preservation of landmark
and indigenous trees as defined by this chapter. Mature and established trees
shall generally be preserved in respective order, although tree appearance,
species and aesthetic compatibility with the proposed project are additional
factors to be considered.
      (2)   Permission to remove tree(s) species that do not or will not
contribute to the aesthetic value of the proposed project may typically be
granted. The provision of shade and context of the landscape design are both to
be considered.
      (3)   While the city may require some more modifications to a proposed
site plan, if the retention of a tree would severely limit the development
potential of a property when compared to neighboring property, its removal may
be permitted. In order for such tree removal to be granted, the applicant must
document, with alternative plans and cost estimates, how the tree preservation
would unduly burden the property and development.
   (C)   Need of an expert opinion. Anytime during the project review process,
the city may commission a certified arborist, at the applicant's expense, to
provide a report on the health of a tree that the applicant requests permission
to remove solely for reasons based on the alleged health of the tree such as
the creation of a hazard to future circulation, buildings and/or utilities.
Other factors may include the relative health and the age of the tree and its
likelihood of long term survival.
   (D)   Appeal. As with all discretionary approvals and/or conditions of the
Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission and the Design Review Board,
requirements for tree preservation and/or removal may be appealed as stipulated
in this chapter.
   (E)   Required plus prior to initiating development. Prior to the granting
of a building and/or grading permit, the applicant shall provide a site plan
showing all protected trees as defined by this chapter. There is to be no
excavation within the drip line of such trees with the drip line to be clearly
shown in all grading and layout plans.
   (F)   Special circumstances to allow grading within the drip line. Although
it is always preferable to avoid grading within the drip line, there may be
special circumstances where grading may be permitted, such as when the
preservation of a tree would otherwise not be possible. The permission to grade
within the drip line is not to be seen as a routine procedure for protected
trees, but as an alternative to removing trees that would otherwise be removed.
      (1)   Required plans and additional arborist studies. There is to be no
excavation within the drip line of such trees unless specific plans are to be
submitted to the Department of Community Develop-ment staff that indicates how
grading within the drip is to be carried out without critically harming the
tree. Additional arborist's studies must be provided to support the grading
proposed.
      (2)   Bonding for protected trees where grading will occur within the
drip line. Prior to the granting of a building and/or grading permit, the
developer shall post a bond for each protected tree at which grading will occur
within the drip line. The bonding schedule will be as listed under section
“bonds and penalties.” The city will conduct ongoing inspections during the
course of the grading to assure adherence to approved plans. Should the tree(s)
die “during the course of property development” as defined by this chapter, the
bond shall be forfeited to the city and used for tree replacement. A percentage
of the bond will be retained in either case to assure tree survival for up to
five years after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   (G)   Protection of trees during construction. Unless specific exceptions
are granted prior to the initiation of construction, all construction activity
and traffic shall be prohibited from the area within the drip line of a
protected tree. Should the tree(s) die “during the course of property
development” as defined by this chapter, the applicable penalties of this
chapter shall be levied.
   (H)   Damage of protected tree during con-struction. Should a protected tree
be damaged during site development, the developer shall administer all
reasonable methods of treatments as approved by the Director of Community
Development. The repair of the damage shall be at the expense of the developer.
In addition, the city may require the posting of a bond pursuant to the
requirements of this section.
   (I)   Need for re-hearing of a project. Any time after initial approval of a
site plan by either the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission and/or City
Council, an applicant's request to remove a “protected tree” as shown on the
approved site plan will require a hearing. A new public hearing will be held on
the issue of tree removal and the applicant will be required to re-notice the
surrounding property owners as stipulated in this chapter.
   (J)   Replacement of trees that where legally removed.
      (1)   All trees that are legally removed shall be replaced according to
the following schedule:
         (a)   Each established tree: two 24 inch box trees.
         (b)   Each mature tree: two 48 inch box trees.
      (2)   Legally removed indigenous and land-mark trees shall be replaced by
boxed specimens at a rate and size to be established by the decision-making
body at the time of regular development application approval.
   (K)   Requirement of subsequent owners to maintain trees. All future owners
of parcels on which trees were required to be maintained, (as a condition of
approval) shall be responsible for continued maintenance of such trees. Buyers
of property with such trees, as well as buyers of new all single-family homes,
shall be given disclosure notices from the owner and/or developer of this
requirement, and all other responsibility of tree management and/or
preservation as required by this chapter.
   (L)   Previously approved projects. Projects having tentative map, final
development plan, use permit, and/or design review approval prior to the
effective date of this chapter are not subject to this section of the chapter,
unless those pre-existing approvals expire.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.1206 BONDS AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Payment required.
      (1)   Payment amount. Payments in the amounts as listed by the following
table will be collected by the city pursuant to the requirements for bonds and/
or penalties as mandated by this chapter:
 
Tree Size (Diameter) Bond Amount
10 to 17 inches      $1,000
18 to 25 inches      $2,000
26 to 36 inches      $3,500
37 to 48 inches      $5,000
48 and larger        $10,000
      (2)   Acceptable methods of payments. All payments made for penalties and
or bonds shall be cash, or equivalent security, as approved by the City
Attorney.
      (3)   Maximum bond amount per develop-ment parcel. The property owners'
and/or developers' obligation for cash or other security deposit shall not
exceed a maximum of $25,000 per development parcel.
   (B)   Refund of bond security. At the end of the course of property
development as defined by this chapter, the city shall make a determination as
to the health of the protected tree(s) for which a security deposit was made.
Unless the tree(s) shows obvious signs of ill health, the deposit shall be
returned to the developer and/or property owner. Should the tree be in poor
condition, the city may either:
      (1)   Extend the length of time the bond is held; or
      (2)   Require that the bond be forfeited and used for tree replacement.
   (C)   Use of penalties and forfeited bonds. The money acquired by the city
under this section shall be used as follows:
      (1)   Money collected in conjunction with property development shall be
used in the following order or preference, at the direction of the Director of
Community Development:
         (a)   To replace trees that have died during the course of property
development with a tree of the same species and as close in size as reasonably
possible.
         (b)   To provide additional landscaping on the developers' or property
owners' property.
         (c)   To upgrade and/or landscape public places in the vicinity of the
property.
      (2)   Money collected by the payment of penalties for failure to obtain a
tree removal permit from the Department of Parks, Leisure and Community
Services (independent from site development) shall be used for neighborhood
beautification project as per the discretion of the Director of Parks, Leisure
and Community Services.
   (D)   Exemption from fine. No penalty shall be paid and/or security deposit
bond forfeited if a tree dies during the course of property development but for
reasons beyond the developer's reasonable control. In order for this exception
to be granted, all grading and construction must be consistent with approved
plans.

new land uses and for enlargements of existing uses in proportion to the need
for such facilities created by each use.
   (B)   Establish parking standards for commercial uses consistent with need
and with the feasibility of providing parking on specific commercial sites.
   (C)   Ensure that off-street parking and loading facilities are designed in
a manner that will ensure efficiency, protect the public safety, and where
appropriate, insulate surrounding land uses from adverse impacts.
   (D)   Contribute to a balanced transportation system with a choice or
transit, bicycle, pedestrian, and private automobile modes.
   (E)   Encourage the use of bicycles by providing safe and convenient places
to park bicycles.
   (F)   Facilitate the development of common parking area that serve multiple
establishments or uses.
   (G)   Minimize the area of land consumed by parking by allowing reductions
to the number of required spaces near major transit stations, for uses with
lower parking demand characteristics, and for shared parking facilities serving
uses with different peak demand times.

§ 9-5.1702 BASIC REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   At the time of initial occupancy of a site, construction of a
structure, or alteration or enlarge- ment of a site or structure, off-street
parking facilities and off-street loading facilities shall be provided in
accord with the regulations prescribed in this chapter. Any building or
structure moved from one lot to another shall provide parking as required for a
new building.
   (B)   The number of additional parking spaces or loading berths required for
an alteration or enlarge- ment of an existing use or structure, or for a change
of occupancy, shall be provided before the alteration, enlargement, or change
of occupancy is allowed.
   (C)   (1)   If more than one use is located on a site other than a shopping
center, the number of off-street parking spaces and loading berths to be
provided shall be equal to the sum of the required spaces prescribed for each
use, with the following exception:

sites currently developed with religious assembly uses per §
9-5.1704(F).
   (D)   Off-street parking and loading facilities required by this article for
any use shall not be considered as providing parking spaces or loading berths
for any other use except where a shared parking arrangement applies or a joint
facility exists, including shared parking for residential and religious
assembly uses per §
9-5.1704(F). Such a facility shall contain not less than the total number of
spaces or berths as required individually, or fewer spaces may be permitted
where adjoining uses on the same site have different hours of operation and the
same parking spaces or loading berths can serve both without conflict,
according to the procedures and required findings of §
9-5.1704, Parking Reductions.
   (E)   Parking ratios for shopping center uses shall assume 90% of the
available spaces are located at the front of a building. No more than 10% of
the required parking is to be provided at the rear of a building and this
parking should be designated and enforced as employee parking.
   (F)   If, in the application of the requirements of this chapter, a
fractional number is obtained, one parking space or loading berth shall be
required for a fraction of more than one-half, and no space or berth shall be
required for a fraction of one-half or less.

§ 9-5.1704 PARKING REDUCTIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures and
criteria for allowing reductions to the number of required automobile parking
spaces for projects that are anticipated to generate lower-than-usual parking
demand due to factors such as proximity to major transit stops and stations,
the characteristics of the use, or implementation of transportation demand
management measures, as well as for shared parking facilities serving uses with
different peak demand times. These provisions are also intended to allow
modifications to parking standards when necessary to preserve the architectural
or historical character of a structure or property.
   (B)   Qualifying projects. Reduced parking requirements may be considered
for the following types of projects:
      (1)   Senior housing. The required parking for a senior housing
development may be reduced below the normally required 0.75 spaces per dwelling
unit for projects anticipated to generate lower parking demand due to vehicle
ownership patterns of the residents and/or characteristics of the project
(e.g., proximity to commercial services, proximity to public transportation
systems).
      (2)   (a)   Shared (joint) parking facilities. Parking facilities that
are cooperatively established and operated to serve multiple uses and these
uses generate parking demands primarily during hours when the remaining uses
are not in operation.
         (b)   The addition of residential units to religious assembly sites
shall be deemed an appropriate use case for shared parking facilities.
      (3)   Transit-supportive development. Residential or mixed-use projects
that contain no more than 50 dwelling units and are located within one-half
mile of a major transit stop.
      (4)   Infill sites. Residential or mixed-use projects that contain no
more than 30 dwelling units and are located on infill sites.
      (5)   Uses near public parking facilities. Uses located within one-
quarter mile of a publicly accessible parking facility, the use of which is not
limited to a specific business or activity during the use's peak parking
demand. Such parking facilities shall meet the requirements of §
9-5.1705, Parking Location/Off-Site Parking Facilities.
      (6)   Projects incorporating TDM measures. Projects for which the
developer proposes a set of transportation demand management (TDM) measures-
such as rideshare programs, shuttle services, bicycle trip-end facilities,
staggered work shifts, and telecommuting programs-projected to reduce parking
demand generated by the use. Such projects shall be required to document the
implementation and impacts of such programs, as described in division (E),
Monitoring of TDM Programs, below.
      (7)   Historic structures. Projects for which allowing a reduction in the
number of required spaces (and/or modifications to dimensional requirements for
parking areas) will facilitate the re-use of an existing building that is an
historic resource as defined by the State Public Resources Code or is a
designated historic building.
   (C)   (1)   Procedure. A request for a reduction to the number of parking
spaces consistent with the requirements of this section shall be processed as a
use permit, according to the procedures of Article 27, except for residential
development on religious assembly sites, which is regulated according to
division (F). Any parking reduction that is not in accordance with this section
(i.e., is not a qualifying project pursuant to divisions (B) or (F) or cannot
meet the findings for approval in division (D)) shall require a variance.
      (2)   Parking demand study. In addition to other application materials
required for the consideration of the use permit, the Zoning Administrator may
require submittal of a parking demand study prepared by an independent traffic
engineering professional approved by the city that substantiates the basis for
granting a reduced number of spaces. The parking demand study may include any
of the following information:
         (a)   Total square footage of all uses within existing and proposed
development and the square footage devoted to each type of use.
         (b)   A survey of existing on-street and on-site parking within 350
feet of the project site.
         (c)   Parking requirements for the net change in square footage and/or
change in use, based on the requirements of §
9-5.1703.1, Off-Street Parking Requirements by Use.
         (d)   Estimated net change in parking demand between existing and
proposed development, using any available existing parking generation studies
from the Institute for Transportation Engineers (ITE) or other sources. If
appropriate parking demand studies are not available, the city may require the
applicant to conduct a parking demand survey of a development similar to the
proposed project.
         (e)   Comparison of proposed parking supply with parking requirements
and net change in parking demand.
         (f)   A shared parking analysis, as appropriate.
         (g)   A description of proposed transportation demand management
measures, such as preferential carpool spaces, telecommuting or staggered work
shifts, provision of transit passes or other transit incentives for residents
or employees, incorporation of spaces for car share vehicles, bicycles, or
other measures that will result in reduced parking demand.
         (h)   Other information as required by the city.
   (D)   Required findings for approval. Except as outlined in division (F), in
addition to the required findings for approval of any use permit in §
9-5.2703, Required Findings, an application for a use permit for a parking
reduction may only be approved if the Zoning Administrator or the Planning
Commission makes all of the findings of this section that are applicable to the
particular project, as stated.
      (1)   All projects. For any project for which a parking reduction is
requested, the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission must make all of
the following findings based on information in the record:
         (a)   The use will adequately be served by the proposed parking;
         (b)   Parking demand generated by the project will not exceed the
capacity of or have a detrimental impact on the supply of on-street parking in
the surrounding area; and
         (c)   If required, a parking demand study prepared by an independent
traffic engineering professional approved by the city supports the proposed
reduction.
      (2)   Shared (joint) parking. Where a shared parking facility serving
more than one use is proposed, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission
may only approve a parking reduction if it finds that:
         (a)   The peak hours of use will not overlap or coincide to the degree
that peak demand for parking spaces from all uses will be greater than the
total supply of spaces;
         (b)   The proposed shared parking to be provided will be adequate to
serve each use;
         (c)   A written agreement between landowner(s) and the city, in a form
satisfactory to the City Attorney, has been submitted to and approved by the
Zoning Administrator. This agreement shall be in a form capable of and subject
to being recorded to constitute a covenant running with the land and shall
include:
            1.   A guarantee that there will be no substantial alteration in
the uses that will create a greater demand for parking;
            2.   A guarantee among the landowner(s) for access to and use of
the shared parking facilities;
            3.   A provision that the city may require parking facilities in
addition to those originally approved upon a finding that adequate parking to
serve the use(s) has not been provided; and
            4.   A provision stating that the agreement shall not be modified
or terminated without the approval of the Community Development Director and
City Attorney.
      (3)   Other parking reductions. For applications for a parking reduction
that do not involve a shared parking facility, the Zoning Administrator or
Planning Commission may only approve a use permit if it finds that special
conditions-including, but not limited to, the nature of the proposed operation;
proximity to frequent transit service; transportation characteristics of
persons residing, working, or visiting the site; or because the applicant has
undertaken a transportation demand management program-will reduce parking
demand at the site below the level of the normal requirement.
   (E)   Monitoring of TDM programs. Any project that is granted a parking
reduction on the basis of TDM measures that will be incorporated to reduce
parking demand shall submit an Annual Status Report to the city. The report
shall be in a manner prescribed by the Zoning Administrator, and shall describe
the implementation and maintenance of TDM measures and the parking demand
generated by the project. Annual Status Reports will be reviewed to determine
if property owners have implemented and/or maintained the TDM program. City
staff may request auditable documentation to determine compliance.
      (1)   Revocations. A use permit issued to allow a parking reduction may
be revoked by the Planning Commission according to the procedure in §
9-5.2707.1, Violation, Revocation, Fine.
      (2)   After holding a hearing, the Planning Commission may revoke or
modify the use permit for a parking reduction if any one (or more) of the
following findings are made:
         (a)   The use permit was obtained by misrepresentation or fraud.
         (b)   The land use for which the permit was granted has ceased or has
been suspended for six or more consecutive calendar months.
         (c)   The conditions of the permit have not been met, or the permit
granted is being or has recently been exercised contrary to the terms of the
approval or in violation of a specific statute, ordinance, law or regulation.
   (F)   Residential development on religious assembly sites. Notwithstanding
divisions (C) and (D), parking reductions and shared parking arrangements are
permitted for religious assembly sites to accommodate residential development
of four or more units as outlined below.
      (1)   Qualification.
         (a)   The proposed housing development must be located on or adjacent
to the religious-use parking.
         (b)   A religious institution must own the site (whether directly,
through a wholly owned company or corporation, or through an affiliated or
associated nonprofit public benefit corporation), or the religious institution
must have entered into an agreement or transaction (including a land sale) with
a housing developer.
         (c)   The housing development project must meet at least one of the
following criteria:
            1.   Rent or sell at least 5% of units, excluding any density
bonus, at amounts affordable to very low-income households for at least 20
years.
            2.   Rent or sell at least 10% of units, excluding any density
bonus, at amounts affordable to low-income households for at least 20 years.
            3.   Meet one of the criteria in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65915(b)(1)(C)
through 65915(b)(1)(G), inclusive, also known as State Density Bonus Law.
         (d)   Consistent with Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(c)(3), the housing
development project must replace eligible on-site rental housing units that are
demolished or removed.
      (2)   Existing parking. The curing or correcting of nonconforming
religious assembly parking is not required unless there is a threat to public
health and safety.
      (3)   Parking reduction. The number of existing religious assembly
parking spaces onsite may be eliminated by up to 50% to accommodate the
construction of the residential development. The remaining parking may be
shared by the religious assembly use and residential use. If the post-
construction parking accommodates at least one onsite parking space per
residential unit, no parking studies are required and the city shall
ministerially approve the parking reduction and shared parking agreement.
         (a)   A parking ratio of less than one parking space per residential
unit may apply in certain cases, such as for sites are within one-half mile
walking distance of a major transit stop, consistent with Cal. Gov’t Code
§ 65913.6(f)(3).
         (b)   Development projects that remove more than 50% of the existing
religious assembly parking are only permitted if the remaining parking meets
the required off-street parking for religious assembly uses.
      (4)   Shared (joint) parking. Any shared parking agreements shall be
shared in writing with the Zoning Administrator and shall include:
         (a)   A guarantee that there will be no substantial alteration beyond
the approved uses that will create a greater demand for parking;
         (b)   A guarantee among the landowner(s) for access to and use of the
shared parking facilities; and
         (c)   A provision stating that the agreement shall not be modified or
terminated without the approval of the Community Development Director.
      (5)   Additional reductions. Eligible projects may request additional
parking reductions to allow parking ratios less than one space per unit either:
         (a)   Pursuant to this section (e.g., senior housing, transit-
supported development, projects incorporating TDM measures, and the like) and
in adherence with the requirements and procedures of divisions (C) through (E);
or
         (b)   Pursuant to state density bonus law and in adherence with the
requirements and procedures of Article 35.

§ 9-5.1705 OFF-SITE PARKING FACILITIES.
   Required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use they
serve. However, this requirement may be modified to allow a parking facility
serving one or more non-residential uses located on a site other than the site
of one or more such use(s) according to the requirements of this section. Such
a modification shall be processed as a use permit pursuant to the procedures of
Article 27, and a decision on the application shall be rendered by the Planning
Commission.
   (A)   Standards.
      (1)   Uses served. An off-site parking facility may only serve non-
residential uses.
      (2)   Location. Any off-site parking facility must be located within 400
feet, along a paved wheelchair-accessible walk, of the principal entrance
containing the use(s) served.
      (3)   Parking agreement. A parking agreement subject to review and
approval by the City Attorney shall be submitted. The parking agreement shall
be in one of the two following forms and shall not be modified or terminated
without the approval of the Community Development Director and City Attorney:
         (a)   A covenant running with the land or an easement, subject to the
approval of the City Attorney, and recorded in the County Recorder's Office.
The owner of record of the proposed off-site parking facility shall submit a
title report for the parcel and a covenant running with the land, or an
easement, that describes the parcel and obligates it for parking purposes free
and clear of exceptions that would interfere with the use, describes the
obligation of the party to maintain the parking facility, and describes the
parking facility by a parking diagram; or
         (b)   A parking lease agreement for the proposed off-site parking
facility that is signed by both the permittee and property owner or agent of
the property owner authorized to bind the owner, subject to the approval of the
City Attorney, and recorded in the County Recorder's Office. The parking lease
agreement shall run with the use and state the number of spaces subject to the
lease and the days and hours of operation when the parking will be leased,
term/duration of the lease, and include a description of the facility,
including a parking diagram.
   (B)   Findings for approval. The Planning Commission may only approve a use
permit to allow an off-site parking facility to meet the parking requirements
for a use if it finds that all of the following are true:
      (1)   The applicant has demonstrated that the off-site parking will be
available to the use, and that no substantial conflict will exist in the
principal hours or periods of peak parking demands of any uses which are
proposed to share the parking.
      (2)   Access to the site is adequate to accommodate the proposed off-site
parking and any resulting excess traffic to the facility.
      (3)   The design, location, size and operating characteristics of the
proposed off-site parking facility are compatible with the existing and future
land uses on-site and in the vicinity of the subject property.
      (4)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed
parking at the location proposed will not endanger, jeopardize, or otherwise
constitute a nuisance for persons residing or working in the neighborhood of
the proposed parking lot or structure.
      (5)   Any proposed valet parking use, if included, will not generate
excessive traffic on surrounding public streets and will not utilize any
residential street.
      (6)   The shared parking spaces will be available for as long as the uses
requiring the spaces are in operation.
      (7)   The peak hours of parking demand for all of the uses sharing
parking do not conflict so that peak demand is greater than the parking
provided.
      (8)   A written agreement between land-owner(s) and the city, in a form
satisfactory to the City Attorney as set forth in §
9-5.1705(A)(3) of the Zoning Ordinance. This agreement shall be in the form
capable of and subject to being recorded to constitute a covenant running with
the land.
   (C)   An applicant for a use permit for shared parking may be required to
submit survey data substantiating a request for reduced parking requirements. A
use permit for shared parking shall describe the limits of any area subject to
reduced parking requirements and the reduction applicable to each use.

   Tandem parking may be permitted to satisfy the off-street parking
requirement in accordance with the following requirements:
   (A)   No more than two vehicles shall be placed one behind the other.
   (B)   Both spaces shall be assigned to a single dwelling unit or non-
residential establishment.
   (C)   Tandem parking to meet required parking for non-residential uses may
be used for employee parking; the maximum number of tandem parking spaces shall
not exceed 50% of the total number of spaces. When tandem parking is used to
meet retired parking for non-residential uses the applicant shall provide valet
parking or establish a system to facilitate retrieval of parked vehicles.
   (D)   Tandem parking to meet required parking for multi-unit development
shall be located within an enclosed structure; the maximum number of tandem
parking spaces shall not exceed 50% of the total number of spaces.

developing areas in the city. To preserve the design integrity of neighborhoods
in the city.
   (B)   To allow residential developers reasonable flexibility to respond to
changing market demands. To achieve consistency in reviewing requests for
changes to previously approved projects.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2202 PROCESS.
   (A)   Any request to modify the design and/or product size of previously
approved projects will be reviewed by staff to determine whether the change is
major or minor. Generally speaking, a change will be considered to be major if
it requires the development of a new model complex. Other criteria that would
constitute a major change include:
      (1)   A modification in architecture and/or building materials that
change the architectural style and/or character of the project.
      (2)   A significant change in unit size and/or floor plan.
      (3)   A change in unit mix that substantially changes the average unit
size and/or character of the project.
   (B)   Minor changes would typically include such items as changes to
architectural detailing, minor floor plan alterations, redistributions of
product types without significant changes to the overall product mix, and the
like.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2203 REVIEW.
   (A)   If a change is determined to be major, then the following review
process will be required:
      (1)   An architectural change with only slight modifications to building
square footage shall require a use permit or modified use permit, subject to
Design Review Board and Planning Commission action.
      (2)   A significant change in unit size or a change in unit mix that
affects average unit size shall require a use permit or modified use permit,
subject to City Council action with review by the Planning Commission and
Design Review Board. An example of a significant change in unit size would be
if the entire range of model types is shifted up or down in floor area so that
the sizes of both the largest and smaller units are changed.
   (B)   If a change is determined to be minor, then the proposal will be
subject to staff administrative review.
   (C)   If a change involves modifying the size and/or dimensions of parcels,
other than adjustments typically associated with going from a tentative map to
a final map, then a modified final development plan and tentative map will be
required, subject to Planning Commission review and City Council action.
   (D)   For all items requiring public hearings (e.g., use permits, final
development plans, tentative maps) the applicant, as part of the regular
noticing requirement, shall provide the city with a property owners' list and
stamped envelopes for residents who own or have purchased property within the
area potentially affected by the requested change as of the date the
application was submitted to the city.

requested changes in addition to standard review criteria. The intent of this
list is not to be exhaustive, but simply to highlight key issues that should be
considered:
   (A)   While all building elevations are important, the most important is the
one seen from the street. The design and width of the front elevation will be
comparable with but not necessarily equal to the previous approval, so that any
change in unit size will not substantially impact the width of the house as
viewed from the street.
   (B)   The quality of building materials utilized shall be at least
comparable to the previously approved product(s). Additionally, the
architectural form of the home shall not be significantly simplified, unless it
can be found that the proposed form is desirable for the style of house
proposed.
   (C)   The proposed architecture should be compatible with the previously
approved project. If the new architecture and/or home design is significantly
different from the previously approved project, then the new homes should be
grouped into neighborhoods distinct and separate from the existing homes.
   (D)   If the proposed units are larger than the previously approved project,
then the issue of building mass (i.e., the amount of total building square
footage as compared to the size of the parcel) shall be considered.

ARTICLE 23: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 9-5.2301 PURPOSE.
   Planned Development Districts are intended to accommodate a wide range of
residential, commercial and industrial land uses which are mutually supportive
and compatible with existing and proposed develop-ment on surrounding
properties. P-D Districts shall encourage the use of flexible development
standards designed to appropriately integrate a project into its natural and/or
man-made setting and shall provide for a mix of land uses to serve identified
community needs. In addition, P-D Districts shall orient pedestrian and bicycle
facilities to encourage non-auto oriented circulation within the development.
Further-more, the P-D process may be used to implement the various Specific
Plans adopted by the city. Once established, the P-D District becomes, in
effect, the zoning code for the area within its respective boundaries.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2302 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Residential P-D Districts.
      (1)   P-D Districts containing residential components may be established
on a parcel or parcels of land having a contiguous area of at least three
acres. Within a Specific Plan Area, a P-D District containing residential uses
may be designated for properties totaling less than three acres in size,
provided the district is in substantial conformance with the Specific Plan.
      (2)   Each Residential P-D District established shall include specific
development standards designed for that particular district, to include minimum
lot sizes, setbacks and open space requirements, architectural and landscaping
guidelines, and maximum building heights and lot coverages. In establishing
these standards, the requirements for existing zoning and P-D Districts may be
reviewed and modifications to these standards may be made as appropriate.
Varying residential densities may be established for specific areas within each
district. Once approved as part of a final development plan, all standards,
densities, and other requirements shall remain tied to that plan and to the
property designated by that district, unless formally amended by City Council
action.
      (3)   The intent of the Residential P-D is to encourage a wider variety
of densities, product types and setbacks than would otherwise be possible under
conventional residential zoning. Single-family lot size shall vary between and/
or within the P-D Districts to accommodate a range of economic needs.
Furthermore, setbacks and garage door facilities to encourage non-auto oriented
circulation within the development. Furthermore, the P-D process may be used to
implement the various Specific Plans adopted by the city. Once established, the
P-D District becomes, in effect, the zoning code for the area within its
respective boundaries.
   (B)   Commercial/Industrial P-D Districts.
      (1)   P-D Districts which contain only commercial and/or industrial
components shall have no minimum area requirements.
      (2)   As with Residential P-D Districts, all Commercial/Industrial P-
D Districts shall include specific development standards relating to building
setbacks and coverages, minimum lot sizes, and other design requirements for
the components of that P-D District. Architectural and landscaping guidelines
shall be developed for the P-D District which will encourage creativity of
design and/or thematically unite the various elements of the district and these
shall be made a part of the district’s final development plan. Substantial
modifications to these standards shall only be allowed by City Council action.
   (C)   Mixed Use P-D Districts.
      (1)   A P-D District may possibly include mixed uses of residential and
commercial within either the same or adjacent buildings within the district, so
long as such mixed uses are consistent with the Master Plan and Specific Plan
if applicable. Parking requirements for mixed use within the P-D District shall
be as required in §§
9-5.1701 et seq., and design standards for mixed uses shall be established as
part of the district’s final development plan.
      (2)   Commercial and residential components within the same P-D Districts
shall share a similar architectural theme and maximize pedestrian access
between the two.

§ 9-5.2303 RELATIONSHIP TO LAND SUBDIVISION.
   In situations where a subdivision of land (e.g., a tentative map) is
undertaken in conjunction with the establishment or implementation of a P-
D District, such subdivisions shall be processed concurrently and approved
under the same resolution of approval.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2304 USES PERMITTED.
   Any and all uses otherwise permitted in the city may be included in a P-
D District, provided such uses are shown on the approved final development plan
for that district and are in accordance with the General Plan and any
applicable Specific Plan.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2305 RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING PLANS.
   All standards, requirements, densities, land use designations and other
contents of an approved final development plan shall be in substantial
conformance with the General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2306 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to the required application submittal forms available from the
Community Development Department and specified supporting materials, the
following shall also be required for all P-D District establishment requests
and shall be approved by the Planning Commission as a part of the final
develop-ment plan:
   (A)   A listing of the development standards proposed for the P-D District
(e.g., setbacks, lot sizes, building heights);
   (B)   A phasing plan indicating the approximate date when construction of
the first development phase of the P-D District is scheduled to begin and
tentative completion dates for the remaining phases.
   (C)   A Stormwater Control Plan prepared by an engineer or equally qualified
professional as determined by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may require
that the storm water control plan be prepared by a licensed civil engineer. All
architectural, civil engineering, and landscape site plans shall be consistent
with the storm water control plan.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94; Am. Ord. 1064-C-S, passed 12-13-05)
§ 9-5.2307 ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   A preliminary development plan must be prepared for all proposed P-
D Districts containing residential components and Planning Commission approval
of the preliminary development plan is necessary. P-D Districts containing only
commercial and/or industrial uses are not required to undergo preliminary
development plan review and may begin the review process at the final
development plan stage. In considering the preliminary development plan at its
public hearing the Commission shall determine whether or not the land uses
suggested and their interrelationships are generally acceptable and may
approve, modify or deny the proposal based on this review. In any case,
approval of the preliminary development plan shall not constitute an
endorsement of the proposal's precise location, extent of uses, configuration
of parcels or engineering feasibility.
   (B)   Once a preliminary development plan for a residential P-D District has
been approved by the Planning Commission, a final development plan may be
submitted to the city. For P-D Districts that do not contain residential
components, a final develop-ment plan may be submitted without a preliminary
development plan. If subdivision within the district is necessary or if the
plan will be implemented in phases then a tentative map is necessary and may be
applied for at this time. Once the application has been deemed complete by
staff a public hearing before the Planning Commission shall be scheduled. At
this hearing the Commission will make a recommendation to the City Council
based on a review of the environmental impacts of the plan, the appropriateness
and interrelationship of the proposed uses, any effects on traffic circulation
due to development of the plan, the quality of the suggested site plan design
and other details of the proposed district. A favorable recommendation must
include the findings listed in this chapter for a final development plan. In
addition the Design Review Board must review all of the design features of a
proposal (e.g., architecture, landscaping, signage) and any conditions of
approval imposed by the Board shall be added to the recommendation to the
Council. At its public hearing the Council may decide to approve or deny the
final development plan or return the matter to the Planning Commission for
further evaluation. If approved the property shall be rezoned as a P-D District
and so indicated on the zoning map for the city.
   (C)   (1)   A use permit shall be required prior to the construction of any
phase of an approved P-D District. It is the intent of the use permit to
further clarify the details of the development phase being considered and to
ensure that each component complies with the established provisions of the
district. The use permit is not intended to obtain further exactions of the
developer but is to refine the final development plan and implement the
conditions of approval attached to the final development plan. Use permit
approval shall be required prior to final map recordation for all projects
within a P-D District.
      (2)   A use permit may be granted by the Zoning Administrator or the
Planning Commission, provided that the proposed development phase is in
substantial conformance with any approved final development plan for that
property and the conditions thereof. In approving a use permit for a phase of
the P-D District the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission may add
conditions of approval which are consistent with the intent and provisions of
an approved P-D District and help to implement that district. For P-D Districts
containing commercial and/or industrial components, a master use permit may be
approved which will generally or specifically describe those tenants which may
utilize those components.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2308 FINDINGS REQUIRED.
   The Planning Commission may recommend approval of a final development plan
to the City Council, provided the Planning Commission finds that the facts
submitted with the application and presented at the public hearing(s) establish
beyond reasonable doubt that:
   (A)   Each individual unit of the development can exist as an independent
unit capable of creating an environment of sustained desirability and
stability, and the uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and
potential surrounding uses but instead will have a beneficial effect which
could not be achieved under another zoning district;
   (B)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed meet the standards of the
city's Growth Management Program and adequate utility service can be supplied
to all phases of the development;
   (C)   Any commercial component is justified economically at the location(s)
proposed;
   (D)   Any residential component will be in harmony with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood and community and will result in densities no higher
than that permitted by the General Plan;
   (E)   Any industrial component conforms to applicable desirable standards
and will constitute an efficient, well-organized development with adequate
provisions for railroad and/or truck access and necessary storage and will not
adversely affect adjacent or surrounding development;
   (F)   Any deviation from the standard zoning requirements is warranted by
the design and additional amenities incorporated in the final development plan
which offer certain unusual redeeming features to compensate for any deviations
that may be permitted;
   (G)   The area surrounding the P-D District can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development; and
   (H)   The P-D District conforms with the General Plan of the city.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2309 LAPSE OF APPROVAL.
   A final development plan shall expire two years after date of approval or at
an alternate time specified as a condition of approval, unless there has been
any activity in that P-D District (e.g., a use permit has been approved or
building permit issued for any development phase of the P-D) or an extension
has been granted. Preliminary development plans shall expire one year after
date of approval unless application for final development plan approval is
submitted.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2310 EXTENSION AND RENEWAL.
   A final development plan approval may be extended by the Planning Commission
for a two-year period without notice or public hearings, if the findings
required remain valid and application is made at least 30 days prior to
expiration. The Planning Commission may modify the final develop-ment plan and/
or add conditions of approval at this time based on this review.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2311 CHANGED PLANS AND NEW APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   A request for modifications to the conditions of approval for a final
development plan shall be treated as a new application, unless the Zoning
Administrator finds that the changes proposed would be non-controversial,
minor, do not involve substantial alterations or additions to the plan, and are
consistent with the intent of the original approval.
   (B)   If an application for a final development plan is denied, no new
application for the same, or substantially the same, final development plan
shall be filed within one year of the date of last denial, unless the denial
was made without prejudice.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2312 P-D DISTRICTS APPROVED PRIOR TO ADOPTION.
   Final development plans approved by the City Council prior to adoption of
this chapter shall not be subject to these provisions.

ARTICLE 24: HILLSIDE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 9-5.2401 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Hillside Planned Development District (HPD) is intended to promote
a more harmonious visual and functional relationship between the natural and
built environments.
   (B)   The district shall provide for the following:
      (1)   The preservation of significant features of hillside areas, such as
drainage swales, streams, steep slopes, ridgelines, rock outcroppings and
native vegetation;
      (2)   The encouragement in hillside areas of an alternative and varied
development approach that would provide the maximum in safety and human
enjoyment while utilizing the opportunities presented by the natural terrain;
      (3)   The concentration of dwelling units and other structures through
clustering so as to preserve the most sensitive terrain in its natural state;
      (4)   A mixture of housing stock so as to provide variation in
appearance;
      (5)   Compliance with the land use densities specified in the General
Plan with the understanding that in areas featuring steeper slopes, densities
shall diminish as the slope of the terrain increases;
      (6)   Consistency with the Open Space Element of the General Plan and
evidence that detailed and effective arrangements for the preserva-tion,
maintenance and control of open space and recreational lands are provided;
      (7)   The minimization of grading and cut and fill operations consistent
with the retention of the natural character of the terrain; and
      (8)   The minimization of water runoff and soil erosion problems in the
modification of the terrain to meet on-site and off-site development needs.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2402 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   This section shall apply to those hillside areas in which one or more
of the following apply:
      (1)   A predominant portion of the area has slopes in excess of 10%;
      (2)   A significant area of slopes of 25% or greater are located in the
area; or
      (3)   A significant ridgeline, hilltop, or exposed slope is located in
the area.
   (B)   Applicability for a particular area shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator and may be appealed to the Planning Commission and City Council.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to those parcels of record for
which a tentative map or final development plan has been approved and for which
a plan or map has not expired. All such parcels of record shall be permitted at
least one dwelling unit unless such right is or has been previously waived by
scenic easement, deed of development rights, or other device.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2403 RELATIONSHIP TO LAND SUBDIVISION.
   In situations where a subdivision of land (e.g., a tentative map) is
undertaken in conjunction with the establishment or implementation of a P-
D District, such subdivisions shall be processed concurrently and approved
under the same resolution of approval.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2404 USES PERMITTED.
   An HPD District shall generally be reserved for residential uses; however,
other uses may be permitted in accordance with the General Plan or any approved
Specific Plan and provided such uses are shown on the approved final
development plan for that district.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2405 RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING PLANS.
   All standards, requirements, densities, land use designations and other
contents of an approved final development plan shall be in substantial
conformance with the General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2406 ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   A Hillside Planned Development District may be established upon an
application of the property owner or owners or upon the initiative of the city.
   (B)   Prior to the extensive preparation or submittal of detailed plans and
information the applicant is required to submit a preliminary proposal to the
Community Development Department so that the applicant may be informed of
possible environ-mental concerns, General Plan and engineering requirements,
circulation, siting and design criteria and other factors that may affect the
proposal.
   (C)   A preliminary development plan for a proposed HPD District shall be
submitted for Planning Commission approval. In considering the preliminary
development plan at its public hearing, the Commission shall determine its
appropriateness based on its ability to meet the purpose of this article. In no
case shall approval of the preliminary develop-ment plan constitute an
endorsement of the proposal's precise location, extent of uses, configuration
of parcels or engineering feasibility.
   (D)   Once a preliminary development plan has been approved by the Planning
Commission a final development plan may be submitted to the city. The review
and approval procedure and findings for a final development plan for a HPD
District shall be the same as that for a P-D District. If approved the property
shall be rezoned as an HPD District and so indicated on the zoning map of the
city.
   (E)   A use permit shall be required prior to the construction of any phase
of an approved HPD District and shall follow the same review and approval
procedure as outlined for P-D Districts.
   (F)   The required submittal materials for HPD District approval shall be as
listed in the application package available from the Community Development
Department.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2407 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND CRITERIA.
   (A)   The development standards and criteria set forth in this section are
the minimum necessary to insure that the intent of this article is achieved.
Such standards and criteria recognize the unique nature of hillside areas and
are designed to provide greater flexibility so that more innovative development
schemes are possible. Despite the intended flexibility, there may arise unique
circumstances in which the development standards and criteria set forth in this
section may result in severe hardship or produce results counter to the stated
intent of this chapter. Where these circumstances are proven to exist,
exceptions to such standards may be permitted coincidental with the approval of
the Hillside Planned Development District.
   (B)   It is the expressed intent of this section that innovative development
techniques be utilized in hillside areas, therefore flexible lot standards
shall be allowed. To this end, minimum yard or lot areas, lot widths, lot
depths, distances between buildings, maximum lot coverage and/or rear yard
access requirements shall be specific for each HPD District and approved with
the final development plan and use permit for each project. This provision
shall be consistent with any and all fire, building or other safety codes.
   (C)   In approving an HPD, the degree to which the proposed lot specifics
meet the intent of this chapter shall be evaluated based on the following:
      (1)   The manner in which the proposal relates to the natural topography;
      (2)   The degree to which grading and cut and fill operations are
minimized;
      (3)   The stability of the soil and underlying geology;
      (4)   The degree to which unique natural features, such as rock
outcroppings, ravines, creeks, and steep hill faces, are preserved;
      (5)   The effect on native vegetation and the extent to which landscaping
enhances the character-istics of the area;
      (6)   The vehicular accessibility;
      (7)   The extent to which parking areas are well-designed and functional;
      (8)   The degree to which dwelling units relate to recreational and
natural areas;
      (9)   The degree to which individual privacy is provided for; and
      (10)    The degree to which the project relates to adjacent existing and
future developments.
   (D)   The design of building, fences, and other structures shall be in
harmony with and enhance natural site characteristics in regard to height,
massing, texture, color, reflective properties, roof characteristics, and
setbacks. Fences shall not extend vertically into any areas where the visual
quality of a hillside would be disrupted nor shall the roofing of any structure
be situated so as to visually extend above any significant ridgeline when
viewed from off-site.
   (E)   (1)   Hillside streets should reflect a rural rather than an urban
character. Curbs and gutters will be required, unless it can be shown that an
alternative pavement treatment will permit adequate drainage and will not
adversely impact the roadway base.
      (2)   Horizontal and vertical street align-ments should relate to the
natural contours of the site. Proposed street designs shall minimize grading to
the extent feasible and shall account for the following:
         (a)   The steepness of the terrain;
         (b)   The depth of the cut, the amount of cut and hill required and
the height and appearance of required retaining walls;
         (c)   The ability to grade required cut and fill areas to give the
appearance of natural slopes;
         (d)   The provision of off-street parking to compensate for any
inability to provide on-street parking;
         (e)   The provision of adequate turnouts;
         (f)   The adequacy of site distances provided;
         (g)   The safety of driveway entrances;
         (h)   The maximum number of dwelling units which can ultimately be
served by the streets;
         (i)   The length of the street and its potential to become a through
street; and
         (j)   The provision of access for emergency vehicles.
      (3)   To better match a project's streets with its natural setting,
varied right-of-way widths, off-street rather than on-street parking, split
level streets and a variety of street designs (e.g., cul-de-sac, hammerheads,
short loop streets) may be considered. Private streets or lanes may be allowed
where they will create a more desirable living environment and result in a more
effective use of hillside amenities.
      (4)   Street lighting used in an HPD District shall be low profile,
unobtrusive, and designed to enhance the rural character of the area while
providing adequate safety and security.
   (F)   (1)   A pedestrian circulation plan shall be provided to ensure
adequate separation between vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The need for
public sidewalks shall be determined by their expected levels of use and may be
waived where appropriate. Private walkways/paths connecting dwelling units with
each other and with various components of the HPD District may be utilized and
shall be the responsibility of a homeowners' association or other maintenance
mechanism.
      (2)   Bicycle and equestrian trails, if provided, shall be integrated
into an overall plan for the HPD District and, where possible, provide linkage
to a city-wide and/or regional trail system.
   (G)   (1)   Where the General Plan and/or an adopted Specific Plan
designates any portion of an area as open space, it shall be reflected in the
proposed development plan. Any area not previously designated as open space but
which lends itself to such use should be similarly identified on the
development plan. Areas proposed as open space should include irreplaceable
natural features such as stream beds, significant stands of trees, individual
trees of significant size, age and/or appearance, exposed or steep slopes,
significant ridgelines and rock outcroppings. Natural features of lesser
significance which nonetheless are aesthetically important shall be preserved.
      (2)   Dedication of open space as a part of a public open space or park
system may be required. Where such offer of dedication is not accepted, the
development shall provide for the maintenance and preservation of such open
space through covenants or other legal arrangements acceptable to the Council.
Common private open space which is permanently maintained as a landscaped park
or recreational area may be eligible for credit toward the development's park
dedication requirements.
   (H)   All new utilities shall be installed under-ground and shall conform to
the rules and regulations of the State Public Utilities Commission. Drainage
and flood control devices shall be integrated into the landscape and, where
feasible, natural-appearing drainage ways shall be used.
   (I)   A Stormwater Control Plan shall be prepared by an engineer, or equally
qualified professional as determined by the City Engineer. The City Engineer
may require that the Stormwater Control Plan be prepared by a licensed civil
engineer. All architectural, civil engineering, and landscape site plans shall
be consistent with the storm water control plan.

§ 9-5.2408 GRADING.
   (A)   Any parcel of land subject to this article shall not be graded unless
such grading is specifically shown on an approved final development plan.
Grading shall be planned so that it blends into the natural landscape of the
site and lessens any associated negative visual impacts from such grading. The
use of 2:1 slopes shall be avoided, as shall the use of benches. Where allowed,
2:1 slopes and benches shall be of limited height and designed so that they are
situated and/or screened by structures to minimize visibility from public
rights-of-way and off-site properties. While mass grading is generally
prohibited, the grading of less significant land forms is allowable, as is the
grading of more significant natural features, provided such modifications will
result in an improvement of the overall project and are in keeping with the
overall intent of this article.
   (B)   In steeper areas and areas of greater visibility, grading should
generally be limited to that portion of the site required for the structure and
limited associated outdoor area. The use of retaining walls, terracing,
platform structures, and stepped or post and beam construction shall be used to
minimize the impacts of grading on steeper slopes. In areas of lesser slopes,
limited padding may be allowed where it could provide for the clustering of
development and would otherwise promote the intent of this article.
   (C)   Grading plans shall be reviewed to ensure that any land form
modifications will not adversely impact adjacent property owners and that
proposed grading will be able to blend into any existing and future development
on adjacent parcels.

ARTICLE 27: DESIGN REVIEW, USE PERMITS, ADMINISTRATIVE USE PERMITS AND
VARIANCES
§ 9-5.2701 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This article provides the flexibility in application of land use and
development regulations necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter by
establishing procedures for approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of
design reviews, use permit, administrative use permit and variance
applications.
   (B)   The purpose of design review is to promote the orderly and harmonious
development of the city, the stability of land values and investments, and the
general welfare and to encourage and promote the highest quality of design and
site planning to delight the user and others who come in contact with uses and
structures in the city.
   (C)   Design review plans are required for all new development and additions
to existing structures, unless the Zoning Administrator finds that the addition
is non-controversial, minor, and does not involve a substantial alteration to
the existing structure. Design review is not required for the construction or
alteration of a single-family residence unless within a planned development
regulating the architectural style of the dwelling.
   (D)   Use permits are required for use classifi-cations typically having
unusual site development features or operating characteristics requiring
special consideration so that they may be designed, located, and operated
compatibly with uses on adjoining properties and in the surrounding area.
   (E)   Administrative use permits may be granted by the Zoning Administrator
for minor projects if it can be determined that such projects comply with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances are intended to resolve practical difficulties or physical
hardships that may result from the size, shape, or dimensions of a site or the
location of existing structures thereon; from geo-graphic, topographic, or
other physical conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity; or from
street locations or traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the site.
   (G)   Authorization to grant variances does not extend to use regulations
because the flexibility necessary to avoid results inconsistent with the land
use objectives of this chapter is provided by the use permit/administrative use
permit process for specified uses and by the authority of the Zoning
Administrator to determine whether a specific use belongs within one or more of
the use classifications listed in this chapter.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2702 NOTICE AND PUBLIC HEARING.
   (A)   The Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator, as the case may
be, shall hold a public hearing on an application for a use permit or variance.
An application for an administrative use permit shall be acted upon by the
Zoning Admini-strator without a public hearing being held. Similarly, design
review shall not require a public hearing.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall set a tentative time and place for a
public hearing to be held within 90 calendar days of receiving a completed
application.
   (C)   Notice of the hearing shall be given in the following manner:
      (1)   Mailed or delivered notice. At least 10 calendar days prior to the
hearing a notice shall be mailed to the applicant and all owners of property
within 300 feet of the boundaries of the site subject as shown on the last
equalized property tax assessment role. This noticing area may be expanded if
the application is perceived to have impacts beyond a 300 foot radius. Where
environmental review requires more extensive noticing, it can occur
simultaneously.
      (2)   Posted notice. Notice shall be posted 10 days prior to the hearing
at the Planning Depart-ment and in one newspaper of general circulation. Where
environmental review requires more extensive noticing, it can occur
simultaneously.
   (D)   The notice of public hearing shall contain:
      (1)   A description of the location of the development site and the
purpose of the application;
      (2)   A statement of the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing;
      (3)   A reference to application materials on file for detailed
information; and
      (4)   A statement that any interested person or an authorized agent may
appear and be heard.
   (E)   When applications for design review, use permits, variances or
combinations thereof are filed at the same time for a single site, the city may
schedule a combined public hearing.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2703 REQUIRED FINDINGS.
   (A)   The Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator, as the case may
be, shall approve an application for a use permit or variance as it was applied
for or in modified form as required by the reviewing and approving body.
   (B)   On the basis of the application, plans, materials, and testimony
submitted, the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator shall find all
of the following:
      (1)   For use permits.
         (a)   That the granting of such use permit will not be detrimental to
the public health or welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in
such zone or vicinity;
         (b)   That the use applied for at the location indicated is properly
one for which a use permit is authorized;
         (c)   That the site for the proposed use is adequate in size and shape
to accommodate such use, and all yard spaces, walls, fences, parking, loading,
landscaping, and other features required, to other uses in the neighborhood;
         (d)   That the site abuts streets and highways adequate in width and
pavement type to carry the kind of traffic generated by the proposed use; and
         (e)   That the granting of such use permit will not adversely affect
the comprehensive General Plan.
      (2)   For variances.
         (a)   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property involved, or to the intended use of the
property, that do not apply generally to the property or class of use in the
same zone or vicinity;
         (b)   That the granting of such variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public health or welfare or injurious to the property or
improve-ments in such zone or vicinity;
         (c)   That because of special circum-stances applicable to the subject
property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the
strict application of the zoning provisions is found to deprive the subject
property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity under the
identical zone classifications; and
         (d)   That the granting of such variance will not adversely affect the
comprehensive General Plan.
      (3)   For Design Review and Administrative Use Permit. No findings are
necessary for Design Review Board action or for administrative use permits.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2703.1 ADMINISTRATIVE VARIANCE.
   (A)   Purpose. The provisions of this section allow for an administrative
review of requests to vary from the general setback requirements contained in
the Municipal Code by a maximum of 25% of the required setback. Variance
requests which are over 25% of the required setback shall require a public
hearing as specified in Article 27.
   (B)   Application. An application for an administrative variance shall be
filed using the general variance application provided by the Community
Development Department. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide
evidence in support of the required findings.
   (C)   Jurisdiction. The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to
consider and act on a request for an administrative variance. The Zoning
Administrator shall issue a written determination within 30 days of the date of
receipt of a completed application and may approve the variance, subject to
conditions of approval, or deny the request. All written determinations shall
give notice of the right to appeal.
   (D)   Notice. Notice of the variance request shall be given to property
owners immediately adjacent (both sides and to the rear) to the project site.
Notices shall be mailed out as soon as reasonably practicable after the
application has been deemed complete.
   (E)   Findings.  The Zoning Administrator may approve an administrative
variance only after making all of the findings contained in §
9-5.2703(B)(2) in the affirmative.
(Ord. 994-C-S, passed 4-23-02)
§ 9-5.2704 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
   In approving a design review, use permit, administrative use permit or
variance, the Planning Commission, Design Review Board, or the Zoning
Administrator may impose reasonable conditions necessary to:
   (A)   Achieve the general purposes of this chapter and/or the specific
purposes of the zoning district in which the site is located, and/or to make it
consistent with the General Plan;
   (B)   Protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; and/or
   (C)   Ensure operation and maintenance of the use in a manner compatible
with existing and potential uses on adjoining properties and/or in the

Appeals may be considered in the manner outlined below.
   (B)   A use permit or variance shall become effective at the end of the
appeal period, unless appealed in accord with the following:
      (1)   In the event that applicant or others affected are not satisfied
with the action of the Zoning Administrator, they may appeal to the Commission.
Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the Director of

If, after a hearing by the Commission, the applicant or others affected are not
satisfied with the decision of the Commission, they may appeal to the Council
within five working days after the decision in accord with this section.
      (2)   The Commission or Council, whichever is appropriate for the appeal,
acting through the Director of Development Services or the City Clerk, shall
set the date for a public hearing and shall give notice as set forth in this

      (3)   The Council or Commission shall render its decision within 60 days
after the filing of such appeal, unless the time period is extended by

or variance is required by the provisions of this chapter until five working
days after the granting of such use permit or variance by the Commission or

be granted until the appeal process has been completed. Building permits issued
pursuant to the provisions of this article shall conform to the terms and
conditions of the use permits or variances granted.
      (5)   All appeals to the Commission or Council from the Design Review

(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2706 APPEALS; DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   In the event the applicant or other person is not satisfied with the
architectural design criteria estab-lished by the Design Review Board, they
may, within five days after such decision, appeal in writing to the Council in

appeal to the Council shall not be a public hearing.
(Ord. 897-C-S, passed 10-25-94)
§ 9-5.2707 LAPSE OF APPROVAL.
   (A)   A design review, use permit, administrative use permit, or variance
shall lapse one year after date of approval or at an alternative time specified
as a condition of approval:
      (1)   A building permit has been issued and construction has diligently
commenced thereon and has not expired;
      (2)   A certificate of occupancy has been issued;
      (3)   The use is established; or
      (4)   The design review, use permit, admini-strative use permit or
variance is renewed per division (D) of this section.
   (B)   Unless otherwise specified by a condition of approval, the validity of
a design review, use permit, administrative use permit or variance shall not be
affected by changes in ownership as long as the use or structure is
substantially similar or the same as originally approved and, in the case of a
use permit or administrative use permit, the use is a conforming one. If the
site remains unused for a continuous one-year period, however, the use permit,
admini-strative use permit or variance is considered expired and a new approval
is necessary. Nonconforming non-residential uses with previously approved use
permits/administrative use permits (e.g., those no longer conforming with the
underlying zoning or General Plan designation) shall be subject to review upon
changes in ownership or tenancy.
   (C)   A design review, variance or use permit may be renewed or extended by
the Zoning Administrator for a one-year period without notice or public
hearing, if the findings required remain valid and application is made prior to
expiration. No more than two one year extensions may be granted.

$2,500 for each day that a violation has occurred. Before imposing any such
fine, the city shall give the entitlement holder at least 15 days' advance
written notice of the date, time and place where the Commission will consider
the action, along with a specification of the violation and the proposed amount
of fines. The permit holder shall be given theopportunity to address the

Administrator finds that the changes to the approved plans are non-
controversial, minor, do not involve substantial alterations or additions to
the plans, and are consistent with the intent of the original approval.

extended to occupy a greater area of land or building floor area than it
legally occupied before it became nonconforming.
      (2)   The use shall not be intensified so that the hours of operation are
extended, the number of employees are increased, the occupancy capacity is
increased, the volume of traffic or noise generated by the use is increased, or

   (A)   Discontinuance.
      (1)   If the nonconforming use of land, a nonconforming use of a
conforming structure, a conforming use of a nonconforming structure, or use of
nonconforming physical improvements is discontinued for a continuous period of
365 calendar days or more, all rights to legal nonconforming status shall
terminate.

use continued as before; provided, that permits have been obtained and the
restoration work is started within 12 months of the date of the damage, and the
work is continuously pursued to completion within 12 months from the date
building permits were issued. The Director of Community Development may extend
these time limits if presented with evidence that there are external factors,
such as insurance company payouts or hazardous material contamination, that
prevent a property owner from proceeding with restoration within 12 months of
the date of damage, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director of
Community Development with evidence furnished by the applicant.
      (2)   Greater than 50 percent. If the cost of repairing or replacing the
damaged portion of the nonconforming structure or physical improvements is

variance procedure or resulted from a lot line adjustment; or
      (4)   Partial government acquisition. The parcel was created in
compliance with the provisions of this zoning code, but was made nonconforming

decreased not more than 20% and the yard facing a public right-of-way was
decreased not more than 50%.
   (B)   Subdivision or lot line adjustment.
      (1)   No subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be approved that would

improvements, referenced in division (D)(1) of this section, or parts thereof,
are not in compliance with the zoning code, they shall be deemed to be
nonconforming and shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this
article.
      (3)   For the purpose of this section, the provisions of Title 8, Chapter
1 (Building Code) shall govern the determination of whether the permit has been

§ 9-5.3110 FINDINGS REQUIRING DISAPPROVAL.

the adverse effects set forth in this article.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the City Council
may deny a use permit if it finds that vacancies in the building have been
created by unjust evictions and unreasonable rent increases in order to qualify
a project for conversion under this subsection.
(Ord. 1070-C-S, passed 6-13-06)
§ 9-5.3111 FINDINGS REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL.
   The City Council shall not approve a conditional use permit and tentative
map for a conversion unless it finds that:
   (A)   The proposed conversion is consistent with the general plan,
particularly with the objectives, policies, and programs of the housing element
of the general plan designed to provide affordable housing to all economic
segments of the population.
   (B)   The average rental vacancy rate in comparable multiple-family units
(as defined by complex and unit size, age, and amenities) within the city
during the 12 months preceding the filing of the application is greater than
4.5%; provided, that a conditional use permit may be approved where the vacancy
rate for comparable units is equal to or less than 4.5% if the applicant has
proposed additional measures which the City Council finds would effectively
mitigate the displacement of tenants and any adverse effects upon the housing
stock within the city which would be caused by the proposed conversion.
   (C)   The applicant unconditionally offered to each eligible tenant an
adequate plan for relocation to comparable housing.
   (D)   The CC&R's for the condominium project, shall require the applicant to
establish an owner occupancy program that ensures a stable community of
residents, is consistent with residential lending requirements, and discourages
excessive real estate speculation. At a minimum, such program shall include the
following requirements unless otherwise approved by the Community Development
Director:
      (1)   Owner occupancy of at least 70% of the units;
      (2)   Minimum lease durations; and
      (3)   Registration of tenants and vehicles with the Homeowner's
Association.
   (E)   All the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, this article, and other
applicable provisions of this code are met.
   (F)   (1)   Prior to the approval of the final map, the applicant has
entered into an agreement, subject to the City Attorney's approval, with the
Homeowners' Association, whereby 2.5% of the amount of each unit purchase price
shall, at close of escrow, be deposited into a Homeowners' Association Capitol
Reserve Account. The amount of the fee, if conditions warrant, may be increased
above the established fee by the City Council. This fund shall be used for
repair of items in the common area and structures, or other capitol repair or
replacement items which the Association deems necessary. This fund shall be
over and above any funding reserve requirements required by the State
Department of Real Estate. The fund shall be held separately from funds
required by the State Department of Real Estate.
      (2)   The intent of the city in requiring the creation of a contingency
or reserve fund for condominium conversions is to provide a surety for
unexpected or emergency repairs to common areas in the interest of the
economic, aesthetic and environmental maintenance of the community as well as
to protect the general welfare, public health and safety of the community.
   (G)   Pursuant to the Cal. Gov't Code, Subdivision Map Act Chapter 2,
Article 1, the Council shall not approve a final map for a subdivision to be
created from the conversion of a residential real property into a condominium
project unless the Council finds that all of the Tenant Notification provisions
of the California Map Act and Article 31 have been met.

determination of "comparable" as will accessibility to the tenant's place of
employment; community and commercial facilities, schools; and public
transportation.
      (2)   Payment of a relocation fee, equal to the amount of three month's
rent, to each tenant who does not choose to purchase. A tenant is not entitled
to a relocation fee pursuant to this section if the tenant has been evicted for
just cause.
      (3)   The offer to each eligible tenant of a plan for relocation shall be
free of any coercion, intimidation, inducement or promise not herein specified
and shall not cause the tenant to vacate in advance of, a timetable or schedule
for relocation as approved in its application for approval of conversion.
      (4)   Any tenant who chooses not to purchase and who is handicapped, or
who has minor children in school, or is age 60 or older living in any unit

lessee or tenant of any such dwelling unit because such person opposed, in any
manner, the conversion of such building into a condominium.
   (D)   Pre-conversion protection. From the date of application for a use
permit to convert, or until relocation takes place or the application is denied
or withdrawn, but in no event for more than two years, no tenant shall be
unjustly evicted and no tenant's rent shall be increased more frequently than
once every six months, nor in an amount greater than the annual increase in
utility costs, insurance costs, and property tax, plus increased operating
costs not to exceed the Consumer Price Index applicable for the Bay Area per
year. This limitation shall not apply if rent increases are expressly provided
for in leases or contracts in existence prior to the filing date of the
conditional use permit for the conversion.
   (E)   Appliance warranties. The applicant shall at the close of escrow
provide free of charge to the first individual purchaser of each unit a one-
year warranty for repair and replacement on each built-in appliance contained
in the unit, whether new or used.

§ 9-5.3309 DOWNTOWN SPECIFIC PLAN.
   (A)   Findings.  The City Council hereby finds, determines and declares as
follows:
      (1)   The city holds the right to make and enforce all laws and
regulations not in conflict with general laws, and the city holds all rights
and powers established by state law.
      (2)   The Planning Commission conducted a duly noticed public hearing on
March 15, 2017 at which time a resolution was approved to initiate and
recommend to the City Council that this section be adopted. The City Council
held duly noticed public hearings on November 28, 2017 and December 12, 2017,
and heard the item on January 23, 2018 at which time all interested persons
were allowed to address the Council regarding adoption of this section.
      (3)   The city received a grant from the Strategic Growth Council for the
purposes of drafting a Downtown Specific Plan.
      (4)   The Association of Bay Area Governments has identified downtown
Antioch as a Priority Development, a designation intended for areas where
investment, new homes and job growth are encouraged.
      (5)   Cal. Gov’t Code Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 3, Article 8. Specific
Plans [§§ 65450-65457] enables the development, adoption, and implementation of
Specific Plans in the State of California.
      (6)   Antioch Municipal Code Title 9, Chapter 5, Article 33: Specific
Plans further describes the process for development, adoption, and
implementation of Specific Plans in the city.
      (7)   The City Council finds that the Downtown Specific Plan is
consistent with the Antioch General Plan.
   (B)   The Downtown Specific Plan is hereby adopted.
   (C)   CEQA.
      (1)   The 2003 General Plan approval was supported by an Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) that described the potential environmental impacts of
implementation of the Plan. This EIR addressed the potential impacts of
development of downtown Antioch, referred to as Rivertown in the General Plan.
The analyzed impacts correlated to downtown Antioch resulted from the increased
residential density envisioned by the General Plan and the associated traffic,
air quality, and similar development-related impacts. The proposed Downtown
Specific Plan increases density over the existing condition, but at a much
reduced rate than the General Plan. As a result, the Downtown Specific Plan
represents a reduction in anticipated environmental impacts when compared to
the General Plan.
      (2)   Because of this condition, the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) allows for an Addendum to the EIR that was certified with adoption of
the General Plan - a new plan-specific EIR is not warranted. A new EIR would
have been required only if the Downtown Specific Plan was reasonably expected
to generate new or increased impacts that exceed those analyzed by the General
Plan EIR.

ARTICLE 34: SENIOR HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 9-5.3401 SENIOR HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   The Senior Housing Overlay District applies to projects approved prior to
the effective date of this section. Projects with the Senior Housing Overlay
District will continue to be regulated by the terms of the Senior Housing
Overlay District approval, but amendments to those approvals will be processed
pursuant to the Municipal Code in place at the time the amendments are
requested.
(Ord. 2190-C-S, passed 8-25-20)
ARTICLE 35: DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM
§ 9-5.3501 PURPOSE.
   The Density Bonus Program is intended to implement the State Density Bonus
Law in compliance with the requirements of Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915 and the
adopted housing element of the Antioch General Plan by providing incentives
which will encourage developers to construct affordable housing to benefit
lower income households.
(Ord. 2190-C-S, passed 8-25-20)
§ 9-5.3502 DENSITY BONUS PROVISIONS.
   (A)   In addition to any other review required for a proposed housing
development, applications for a density bonus shall be filed with the Community
Development Director. The application for a density bonus shall be filed
concurrently with an application for a development plan review, administrative
approval, or other application necessary for the housing development. In
addition to and in conjunction with the submittal requirements for the housing
development application, the applicant shall submit the following items:
      (1)   The application form and submittal requirements approved by the
Community Development Director.
      (2)   The application fee, established by resolution of the City Council,
at the time the application is filed.
      (3)   Reasonable documentation to establish eligibility for a requested
density bonus, incentives or concessions, waivers or reductions of development
standards, and parking ratios, to the satisfaction of the Community Development
Director.
         (a)   A request for concessions or incentives shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating how the incentive or concession would result in
identifiable and actual cost reductions necessary to meet affordability levels.
         (b)   A request for a waiver or reduction of development standards
shall be accompanied by documentation demonstrating how the development
standards physically preclude the construction of the qualified affordable
housing development.
         (c)   A request for parking ratios pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code §§
65915(p)(2) and (3) shall be accompanied by documentation showing the proposal
meets the criteria in those sections.
   (B)   City staff shall process the application for a density bonus in the
same manner as, and concurrently with, the application for a development plan
review or administrative approval that is required by this Code.
   (C)   When notifying an applicant that city staff has deemed the application
complete, city staff shall include the information required by Cal. Gov’t Code
§ 65915.
      (1)   Any determination required by Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915 shall be
based on the development project at the time the application is deemed
complete. The city shall adjust the amount of density bonus and parking ratios
awarded pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915 based on any changes to the project
during the course of development.
   (D)   The city shall grant the applicant the number of incentives and
concessions required by Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915. The city shall grant the
specific concession(s) or incentive(s) requested by the applicant, unless it
makes any of the relevant written findings, based upon substantial evidence,
stated in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(d).
   (E)   The city shall approve a waiver or reduction of a development standard
requested by the applicant, unless it makes written findings based upon the
criteria in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(e).
   (F)   The applicant shall enter into an agreement with the city to ensure
the continued affordability of all affordable units or the continued
reservation of such units for qualifying senior citizens. Prior to receiving a
building permit for any project that receives a density bonus or any incentive,
concession, waiver, or reduction of development standards pursuant to this
section, such agreement shall be recorded as a covenant against the property.
   (G)   For any development project that is granted a density bonus or other
benefit pursuant to this section, the affordable units that qualify the project
as eligible for a density bonus, must be constructed concurrently with or prior
to the construction of any market rate units. In addition, the affordable units
must be integrated with the market rate units so that there is a mix of
affordable and market rate units, if any, in each building of the development
project.
   (H)   The provisions of this subdivision shall be interpreted to fulfill the
requirements of Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915. Any changes to that Cal. Gov’t Code §
65915 shall be deemed to supersede and govern any conflicting provisions
contained herein.

ARTICLE 36: ZONING MAP
§ 9-5.3601 ZONING MAP.
   (A)   The designations, locations, and boundaries of the districts
established are delineated upon the map entitled “Zoning Map for the City of
Antioch, California,” dated May 14, 1956, which map and all notations and
information thereon are hereby made a part of this chapter by reference. Any
land within the incorporated limits of the city, now or in the future, and not
designated or indicated on the zoning map shall receive a zoning classification
conforming to that designated by the General Land Use Plan of the city.
   (B)   The designations, locations, and boundaries of the districts
established delineated upon the map entitled "Zoning Map for the City of
Antioch, California," shall, as required by State law, be consistent with the
Antioch General Plan.
      (1)   Consistent with the provisions and intent of the General Plan
pertaining to the “A” Street Corridor Focused Planning Area, existing
residential zoning is considered to be consistent with the General Plan, until
such time as lands within the corridor are converted to commercial uses as
delineated in policies for the “A” Street Focused Planning Area. Changes of
zone from residential to commercial land use districts shall be considered to
be consistent with the General Plan if they include frontage along “A” Street
or the State Route 4 freeway, encompass a minimum of one- half developable
acre, and include the majority of a block face from intersection to
intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Consistent with the provisions and intent of the General Plan
pertaining to the area along 18th Street between “A” Street and Hillcrest
Avenue, existing residential zoning is considered to be consistent with the
General Plan, until such time as lands within the corridor are converted to
commercial uses as delineated on the General Plan land use map.
         (b)   Changes of zone from residential to commercial land use
districts shall be considered to be consistent with the General Plan if they
include frontage along 18th Street and encompass an area meeting minimum parcel
size regulations for the district to which the change of zone is requested.
      (3)   Consistent with the provisions and intent of the General Plan
pertaining to the area along Contra Loma Boulevard south of the State Route 4
freeway, existing uses are considered to be consistent with the General Plan,
as are the zoning districts reflecting such existing uses. Changes of zone
along Contra Loma Boulevard south of the State Route 4 freeway shall be
considered to be consistent with the General Plan if they reflect the uses
specifically identified in the General Plan Land Use Element.
      (4)   Consistent with the provisions and intent of the General Plan,
existing single family dwellings within multiple family zones are considered to
be consistent with the General Plan, and to be treated as conforming uses
pursuant to the provisions of this title.

ARTICLE 37: DETERMINATION OF BOUNDARIES
§ 9-5.3701 DETERMINATION OF BOUNDARIES.
   Where the exact boundaries of a district cannot be readily or exactly
determined by reference to the zoning map of the city, the boundary shall be
deemed to be along the nearest street line or lot line, as the case may be. If
a district boundary line divides or splits a lot or parcel of land of less than
12,000 square feet of area, the entire lot or parcel shall be deemed to fall
within the zoning district in which the preponderance of such lot or parcel
lies. Where said preponderance cannot be determined, such lot or parcel shall
be deemed to fail entirely within the more restrictive zoning district. In the
case of parcels in acreage in excess of 12,000 square feet and in all cases
where the methods of determination of this section are inappropriate, the
boundaries shall be determined by scaling the location of such boundaries as
shown upon the zoning map.

§ 9-5.3802 INTRODUCTION TO LAND USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The charts and text in §
9-5.3803 are adopted as the city's basic land use regulations. The uses shown
in this chart are divided into five groups:
      (1)   Residential;
      (2)   Public and semi-public;
      (3)   Commercial;
      (4)   Industrial; and
      (5)   Temporary uses.
   (B)   To determine in which zone a specific use is allowed:
      (1)   Find the use on the left hand side of the table.
      (2)   Read across the chart until either a number or a letter appears in
one of the columns.
      (3)   If a number appears, this means that the use is allowed in the zone
represented by that column, but only if certain special requirements are met.
The requirements applicable to that use are listed in this article. The number
appearing in the zoning column corresponds to the number of the footnote.
      (4)   If a “P” appears in the column, the use is permitted in that zone
by right. If a “U” appears in the column, a use permit is required. If an “A”
appears, an administrative use permit is required which can be issued by the
Zoning Administrator or designated staff. If no letter or number appears in the
column, then the use is not allowed in that zone.
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall interpret the appropriate zone for
any land use not specifically mentioned in this chart and not similar to any
use listed.
      (6)   If a specific use does not appear in the chart, contact the
Community Development Department for assistance.
      (7)   In the Hillside Planned Development (HPD), Planned Development
(PD), Combining (B), Manufactured Housing Combining (T), and Senior Housing
Overlay (SH) Districts use permit approval is required for all uses.
      (8)   In the Mixed Use Medical Facility (MUF) District, a final
development plan and use permit approval is required for all uses. Processing
of final development plans and use permits in the MUMF District shall be as
outlined in the Planned Development District (PD) section of this chapter.

measured above existing legal grade to the peak of the structure.
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided by divisions (E)(2)(b) and (E)(2)
(c) below, a detached ADU created on a lot with an existing or proposed single-
family or multifamily dwelling unit may not exceed 16 feet in height.

on a lot with an existing or proposed single family or multifamily dwelling
unit that is located within one-half mile walking distance of a major transit
stop or a high quality transit corridor, as those terms are defined in Cal.
Public Resources Code § 21155, and the ADU may be up to two additional feet in
height (for a maximum of 20 feet) if necessary to accommodate a roof pitch on
the ADU that is aligned with the roof pitch of the primary dwelling unit.

multifamily dwelling that has more than one story above grade may not exceed 18
feet in height.
         (d)   An ADU that is attached to the primary dwelling may not exceed
25 feet in height or the height limitation imposed by the underlying zone that
applies to the primary dwelling, whichever is lower. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, ADUs subject to this division (E)(2)(d) may not exceed two stories.
      (3)   Fire sprinklers. Fire sprinklers are required in an ADU if
sprinklers are required in the primary residence. The construction of an ADU
shall not trigger a requirement for fire sprinklers to be installed in the
existing primary dwelling.
      (4)   Rental term. No ADU or JADU may be rented for a term that is
shorter than 30 days.
      (5)   (a)   Separate conveyance. An ADU or JADU may be rented, but no ADU

         (a)   All ADUs created before January 1, 2020 are subject to the
owner-occupancy requirement that was in place when the ADU was created.
         (b)   An ADU that is created after that date is not subject to any
owner-occupancy requirement.
         (c)   All JADUs are subject to an owner-occupancy requirement. A
natural person with legal or equitable title to the property must reside on the
property, in either the primary dwelling or JADU, as the person’s legal
domicile and permanent residence. However, the owner-occupancy requirement of
this paragraph does not apply if the property is entirely owned by another
governmental agency, land trust, or housing organization.

         (a)   Must comply with building code. Subject to division (E)(7)(b)
below, all ADUs and JADUs must comply with all local building code
requirements.
         (b)   No change of occupancy. Construction of an ADU does not
constitute a Group R occupancy change under the local building code, as
described in Cal. Building Code § 310, unless the building official or a code
enforcement officer makes a written finding based on substantial evidence in
the record that the construction of the ADU could have a specific, adverse
impact on public health and safety. Nothing in this division (E)(7)(b) prevents
the city from changing the occupancy code of a space that was uninhabitable
space or that was only permitted for nonresidential use and was subsequently
converted for residential use in accordance with this section.

a nonconforming zoning condition, building code violation, or unpermitted
structure on the lot that does not present a threat to the public health and
safety and that is not affected by the construction of the ADU or JADU.
      (2)   Unpermitted ADUs constructed before 2018.
         (a)   Permit to legalize. As required by state law, the city may not
deny a permit to legalize an existing but unpermitted ADU that was constructed

installation of microwave transmitting and relay equipment.
   (B)   Antenna location.
      (1)   In any commercial, industrial, or multi-family residential
district, satellite television antennae are subject to Design Review Board
approval and require a building permit. The Design Review Board shall review
applications with the intent of screening antennae from public view.
      (2)   In a single-family residential district, satellite television
antennae shall be located only in the rear yard of any lot provided a five foot
setback from the rear property line is maintained. If a usable satellite signal
cannot be obtained from such rear yard, the antenna may be located in the side
yard provided a three foot setback from the side property line is maintained.
Any antenna placed in a side yard shall be shielded from the view of a public
street by fencing or appropriate landscaping. A building permit shall be
obtained prior to any antenna installation. If a usable satellite signal cannot
be obtained from the rear or side yard such antenna may be placed on the roof
of the dwelling if a television or antenna technician certifies in writing the
reasons why a usable satellite signal cannot be otherwise obtained. Any
satellite television antenna mounted on the roof shall be of a color compatible
with the roof material so as to reduce visual impact from surrounding
properties and from public streets. If the placement of the antenna in the side
yard would be more obtrusive to neighbors than placement on the roof, then a
roof-mounted installation may be approved by the Building Official, even though
a usable signal may be obtainable from the side yard.
   (C)   Antenna size.
      (1)   Satellite television antennae placed in single-family residential
districts shall not exceed 12 feet in height, including any platform or
structure upon which such antennae are mounted or affixed, and shall not cause
the building height with antenna to exceed 35 feet if the antenna is roof
mounted.
      (2)   Only one satellite television antenna shall be allowed on any lot
of less than one-half acre in size, unless a second antenna is of such a small
size as to be unobtrusive, as determined by the Building Official.
      (3)   All antennae and the construction and installation thereof shall
conform to applicable Building and Electrical Code regulations and
requirements.
      (4)   Antennae shall meet all manufacturers' specifications, be of
noncombustible and corrosive- resistant material, and be erected in a secure,
wind-resistant manner. Every antenna shall be adequately grounded for
protection against direct strikes of lightning.
   (D)   Other regulations.
      (1)   Neither this article, nor the issuance of any permit pursuant to
this article, shall supersede state or federal regulations pertaining to
satellite television antennae, and the issuance of any permit shall not imply
that the receipt of signals from satellites by such antennae is authorized by
state or federal law.
      (2)   Neither this article nor the issuance of any permit pursuant to
this article, shall supersede private deed restrictions or covenants which may
prohibit the installation of such antennae.
   (E)   Other antennae.
      (1)   This article does not differentiate between satellite receiving
dishes and other types of antennae. In situations where traditional television
antennae are allowed and not prohibited by deed restriction, they shall conform
to the height restrictions set forth in this article.

   (B)   Criteria and standards. The Planning Commission or Zoning
Administrator, when considering a use permit application for a hazardous
material facility, shall have the ability to relax or impose stricter standards
than those set forth in this section upon finding that such modifications are
reasonably necessary to implement the general intent of this section and the
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   General standards.
         (a)   All facilities must have engineered structural design features,
to include spill containment and monitoring devices.
         (b)   Underground storage of hazardous materials is preferred, unless
project review proves this unfeasible.
         (c)   Water, sewer, and emergency services must be available to all
hazardous material facilities. Properties located within the city's Sphere of
Influence must first annex to the city and agree to participate in all
applicable assessment districts before necessary utilities can be provided.
         (d)   Facilities must be designed to minimize any additional noise
impacts on surrounding areas.
         (e)   Hazardous material storage areas should be located as far as
possible from electric transmission lines in order to minimize the chances of
interaction between the two.
         (f)   Facilities shall be located in areas with immediate access to a
city-approved Hazardous Material Carrier Route.
         (g)   Processors shall be located close to waste generation sources to
minimize the need for waste transportation.
         (h)   The reduction of hazardous wastes at the source shall be
preferred, with the on-site processing of generated wastes encouraged over the
transport and disposal of wastes off-site.
      (2)   Large hazardous material generators and all hazardous waste
processors other than approved household hazardous waste collection centers
shall not be located:
         (a)   Within 200 feet of a recognized earthquake fault;
         (b)   Within wetland areas, such as marshes, swamps, and bogs;
         (c)   On prime agricultural lands, unless an overriding public need is
served and the facility cannot be better located on an alternate site;
         (d)   Within recreational, cultural, historic, aesthetic, or otherwise
significant areas;
         (e)   In such a manner as to preclude extraction of minerals necessary
to the state economy;
         (f)   Within the watershed of existing or proposed drinking water
reservoirs or near temporary or permanent sources of drifting water;
         (g)   Within critical habitat areas;
         (h)   Within areas with unstable soils, unless engineered design
features are incorporated which assure structural stability;
         (i)   Within non-attainment areas or Prevention of Significant
Deterioration areas unless Risk Assessments show that emissions will not
significantly contribute to the non-attainment of air quality standards, that
such emissions can be miti-gated, and that emissions are significantly less
than those associated with the transportation of hazardous waste out of the
area;
         (j)   Within high groundwater areas, within the 100-year flood plain
or near any bodies of water unless the engineered design of the containment
structure can withstand geologic or soil failure events; and
         (k)   Within 2,000 feet of any existing or future immobile population,
such as residences, schools, or hospitals, unless a Risk Assessment study shows
that a greater distance is necessary. This buffer zone shall be permanently
maintained upon establishment of the facility.
      (3)   In addition to the applicable siting criteria listed above the
following criteria shall also apply to residual repositories:
         (a)   Facilities shall in no case be located within areas subject to
100-year flood events;
         (b)   Areas known or suspected to be supplying principal recharge to a
regional aquifer shall not be considered;
         (c)   Repositories must conform to all State Water Resource Control
Board regulations concerning permeable strata and soils and ground-water areas;
and
         (d)   Residual repositories may be located at greater distances from
waste generation sources due to their need for larger land areas.
      (4)   In addition to the findings required for use permit approval, the
following findings must also be made for hazardous materials facilities:
         (a)   That the facility is in conformance with all applicable siting
criteria listed in the city's Hazardous Material Ordinance and all applicable
federal, state and local regulations;
         (b)   That sufficient evidence has been presented that the facility
will be operated using the best feasible hazardous material management tech-
nologies;
         (c)   That alternative locations for the project have been adequately
considered and the location selected is the most suitable; and
         (d)   That all significant environmental impacts associated with the
project have been con-sidered and will be adequately addressed.
      (5)   For hazardous waste processors, the following findings must also be
made:
         (a)   That the need for the proposed hazardous waste facility has been
adequately demonstrated; and
         (b)   That any conditions recommended by the project's Local
Assessment Committee were considered and those applicable were attached to the
use permit approval for the facility.
      (6)   New pipelines and other channels carrying hazardous materials shall
avoid existing and approved residential areas and other immobile populations to
the greatest extent possible. Where installed, they must be properly designed
to control leakage and above-ground pipelines must be completely surrounded by
spill containment basins.

      (4)   For large hazardous waste generators, written explanation of the
facility's operation and the reasons for its use and/or production of hazardous
materials;
      (5)   For large hazardous waste generators, a Minimization/Management
Plan designed to reduce the facility's use/production of hazardous materials;
      (6)   For large hazardous waste generators, an assessment of the
facility's ability to provide on-site treatment of hazardous wastes produced
and/or to participate in a program to recycle its wastes;
      (7)   For hazardous waste processors, an analysis of the local/regional
need for the proposed facility with at least two alternate sites considered;
      (8)   For large hazardous waste generators and all hazardous waste
processors, an agreement that a Health Risk Assessment analyzing the health and
safety concerns related to the proposal and associated mitigation measures may
be necessary with consultant to be selected by the city and costs to be borne
by the applicant;
      (9)   For large hazardous waste generators and all hazardous waste
processors an agreement that a Communication and Information Panel will be
established for the facility; and
      (10)    A Transportation Analysis may be required depending on the
facility's proximity to an approved carrier route, its distance to a highway,
and the materials to be transported. The analysis is to determine the effects
that the transport of hazardous materials to/from the site will have on the
local circulation network.
Note:  Applicable portions of a proposed facility's required Hazardous
Materials Management Plan may fulfill one or more of the above submittal
require-ments. Any changes to the Hazardous Materials Management Plan must be

§ 9-5.3848 TEMPORARY CANNABIS EVENTS.
   The City Council may authorize a temporary cannabis event if the event meets
all of the following terms and conditions:
   (A)   The event is held either at the Contra Costa Event Park, 1201 West
10th Street, Antioch, CA 94509 or at a District Agricultural Association event.
   (B)   Any retail sales are conducted pursuant to a valid cannabis business
license allowing retail sales and issued by the city.
   (C)   The event complies with state law and regulations.
   (D)   The event will be conducted by the holder of a cannabis event
organizer license and will be a licensed temporary cannabis event.

and security before, during, and after the event.
   (F)   The event organizer provides insurance protecting the city in an
amount and type, and with an admitted surety, satisfactory to the City Attorney
at least 90 days prior to the event.
   Failure by the event organizer to comply with any of the above terms and

the Council, the City Manager, the City Attorney, or the Chief of Police, to
revoke the City Council's authorization for the event and to provide written
notice thereof to the event organizer and the Department of Cannabis Control.
   Because the temporary cannabis event may only be held on property owned by

Infill Housing Overlay District Objective Design Standards.
(Ord. 2211-C-S, passed 4-26-22)
§ 9-5.3850 INNOVATIVE HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Innovative Housing (IH) Overlay District
is to regulate and encourage affordable housing production in new and novel
ways, including expanding where residential development is permitted and the
forms it may take. The IH Overlay applies to sites currently developed with
religious assembly uses with unused or underutilized land. In compliance with
Cal. Gov’t Code § 65583(c)(7), the IH Overlay District also facilitates the
development of accessory dwelling units that can be offered at affordable rent.
   (B)   Definitions. As used in this section, terms are defined as follows:
      ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT or ADU. A residential dwelling unit that provides
complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. An ACCESSORY
DWELLING UNIT also includes the following:
         (a)   An efficiency unit, as defined by Cal. Health and Safety Code §
17958.1; and
         (b)   A manufactured home, as defined by Cal. Health and Safety Code §
18007.
      AFFORDABLE HOUSING. Rental housing that is restricted by recorded
document to provide the housing at an affordable rent, as defined in Cal.
Health and Safety Code § 50053.
      ASSUMED HOUSEHOLD SIZE.  Generally, a household of one person in a studio
apartment, two persons in a one bedroom unit, three persons in a two bedroom
unit, and one additional person for each additional bedroom thereafter.
However, the assumed household size is subject to the requirements of different
funding sources and may differ accordingly.
      COTTAGE. A small detached residential structure. A COTTAGE may be one
detached accessory dwelling unit or two accessory dwelling units attached to
one another (i.e., creating a duplex or two-family dwelling).
      COTTAGE COMMUNITY. A cluster of no fewer than three cottages (which can
range from three units if each cottage is a single ADU to six units if each
cottage is a two-family dwelling) that interact together as a small community
and are designed with a coherent concept. COTTAGE COMMUNITIES are their own
category of residential facilities and are not considered single-family or
multiple-family dwellings. An existing or proposed single-family or multiple-
family dwelling is not required in order to develop a cottage community.
      PUBLIC TRANSIT. Either a high-quality transit corridor as defined in Cal.
Public Resources Code § 21155(b), or a major transit stop as defined in Cal.
Public Resources Code § 21064.3.
      RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY USE. Land or premises to gather together for common
religious proposes, including worship, religious study, and related religious,
philanthropic, or social activities. Churches, chapels, mosques, synagogues,
and temples, are examples of properties developed with religious assembly uses.
      SITE DEVELOPMENT AREA. The portion of a parcel identified for housing
development, including the associated setbacks, usable open space, and onsite
parking and circulation. For example, a religious institution may own a two-
acre site and plan to develop only half the site, making the site development
area one acre.
   (C)   (1)   Review process. Sites shown within the IH Overlay District on
the Antioch Zoning Map are qualified by-right for development of cottage
communities and can submit an application to the Planning Department for
ministerial review. For sites outside of the IH Overlay District, a rezone of
the site to be included in the IH Overlay District is required with approval
from City Council prior to submitting an application to the Planning Division.
      (2)   Sites within the IH Overlay District may be developed pursuant to
their underlying zoning instead of the IH Overlay District regulations. In this
case, development shall be regulated and approved according to the underlying
zoning district regulations and its associated standards, such as the multi-
family residential objective design standards.
   (D)   Affordability. Consistent with Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65583(c)(7) and
65852.2(g), the IH Overlay District goes beyond the statutory minimum to
further the creation of ADUs offered at affordable rate. Housing development in
the IH Overlay District is subject to the following affordability requirements:
      (1)   One hundred percent (100%) of the development project’s total
units, exclusive of a manager’s unit or units, are for lower income households,
except that up to 20% of the total units in the development may be for
moderate-income households and up to 5% of the total units in the development
may be for staff of the religious institution on site. Calculations resulting
in fractional units may be rounded to the next whole number.
      (2)   (a)   All affordable units shall be subject to a recorded deed
restriction of 20 years, unless a local ordinance or the terms of a federal,
state, or local grant, tax credit, or other project financing requires, as a
condition of the development of residential units, that the development include
a certain percentage of units that are affordable to, and occupied by, low-
income, lower income, very low income, or extremely low income households for a
term that exceeds 20 years.
         (b)   This requirement does not apply to any manger’s unit or units or
any unit or units reserved for staff of the on-site religious institution.
   (E)   (1)   Density. Cottage communities shall contain a minimum of three
cottages on a site. The density of a cottage community shall not exceed 15
dwelling units per acre, where the site development area is used to calculate
the site acreage and each ADU counts as one unit. A cottage community with a
density greater than 15 dwelling units per acre requires the approval of a use
permit.
      (2)   ADUs may be attached to one another in sets of two; no more than
two units shall be contained within one building footprint. There is no limit
on the total number of attached structures (e.g., duplexes) in one cottage
community, subject to the density requirements of division (E).
   (F)   Development standards. Cottage communities are not subject to the
multi-family design standards and shall comply with the standards below.
      (1)   Building footprint. All units shall be self-contained and include
their own kitchen and bathroom facilities. No unit shall be smaller than 150
square feet and no greater than 1,200 square feet; a cottage with two attached
units must then be at least 300 square feet and no more than 2,400 square feet.
The building footprint shall be measured by calculating the total square foot
area of a building that covers a portion of a lot, when viewed directly from
above, except for the following structures or parts of structures:
         (a)   Any part of the structure without a roof.
         (b)   Roof eaves.
         (c)   Carports, porches, and balconies that are open at least 50% of
their respective perimeter.
         (d)   Detached garages or sheds.
      (2)   (a)   Height. Cottages shall have a maximum height of 18 feet and
no structure shall exceed two stories.

slope of six to 12, the maximum roof height may extend up to 25 feet. All parts
of the roof above 18 feet must be pitched.
      (3)   (a)   Cottage orientation. Cottages shall generally be oriented
towards common open space, with at least 50% of cottages abutting common open
space.
         (b)   Exception. This standard may be reduced to 40% of cottages
abutting common open space for cottage communities that include at least 15% of
units, exclusive of a manger unit or units, for extremely or very low income
households.
      (4)   Usable open space.
         (a)   1.   Common open space open to all residents shall be provided
and maintained for cottage communities as follows:

                      dwelling unit if any of the cottages are separated by
                      less than 10 feet.A
10 - 20               200 square feet per dwelling unit, of which up to 60
                      square feet may be private open space.
More than 20          250 square feet per dwelling unit, of which up to 70
                      square feet may be private open space.
A.   Duplexes separated from other duplexes (or ADUs) by 10 feet may utilize
the 100 square foot/unit requirement.
 
            2.   Exception. Sites that are within one-half mile walking
distance of a public park are not required to provide common open space if
there is unobstructed access to the park from the development.

shall not be counted as usable open space. Pedestrian and bicycles paths or
trails may not be counted as usable open space.
         (d)   On-site recreational facilities for the religious assembly use
may count towards open space requirements for the cottage community if a
written agreement is provided that allows shared use of the facilities between
the cottage community and religious institution.
      (5)   Setbacks.
         (a)   When the development site area is adjacent to a property line,
the following standards apply:

            5.   Front and street side setbacks shall be reserved for
landscaping only, excluding access and egress driveways.
         (b)   When the development site area is internal to the religious
assembly use and not adjacent to a property line, there are no setback
requirements.
      (6)   Building separation. Cottages shall be separated from other
cottages by at least five feet. The minimum distance between all other
structures shall be in accordance with fire and building code requirements.
      (7)   Architectural standards. Cottage communities shall have a cohesive
architectural theme across all cottages. This could be conveyed through
consistent buildings materials and colors; consistent roof pitch wherein each
cottage’s roof pitch is within ten degrees of all adjacent cottages; horizontal
articulation such as siding, cladding, and floor separation that is parallel
across cottages; and/or consistent window proportions and window spacing
dimensions.

ARTICLE 41: RRMP RODDY RANCH MASTER PLAN DISTRICT
§ 9-5.4101 PURPOSE.
   The RRMP District is intended to implement the General Plan's stated vision
for the development of the Roddy Ranch Focus Area. The RRMP District shall
encourage the use of flexible development standards designed to ensure the
development of the district as a master planned community. The RRMP District
shall be defined principally by large-lot estate residential development, in a
resort style setting, clustered within natural and recreational open spaces and
focused on the existing Roddy Ranch Golf Course. The general development
standards applicable to the RRMP District are defined below. Specific
development standards designed for the RRMP shall be implemented pursuant to a
discretionary non-legislative final development plan prepared according the
regulatory zoning parameters described in this article. Unlike the Planned
Development Districts contemplated by Article 23 or the Hillside Planned
Development Districts contemplated by Article 24, the RRMP District zoning
designation is not an overlay district and is depicted on the city's zoning
map.
(Measure K Initiative, adopted 11-8-05)
§ 9-5.4102 USES PERMITTED.
   The following uses are permitted within the RRMP District:
   (A)   Residential development is permitted within the RRMP District,
provided it does not exceed a maximum of 700 dwelling units generally located
lands not committed to open space nor having significant steep slopes or other
significant environmental constraints. Of these 700 units, all or substantially
all shall be estate residential; any balance shall be multi-family attached
residential project types, as defined in the General Plan, in a resort style
setting. Residential neighborhoods within the RRMP District are encouraged to
be designed to provide high quality housing, including large-lot estate housing
that provides "move up" opportunities for local residents. Residential
development is encouraged to incorporate residential village themes, providing
identifiable neighborhood areas within the planned community. The identity of
individual neighborhoods should be reinforced with differing architectural
styles and locations within the community.
   (B)   Commercial uses are permitted within the RRMP District provided they
primarily serve local neighborhood needs (e.g., grocery, drug store, and
personal services) and are limited to that which can be supported by
residential and recreational uses within the district (e.g., 10 to 20 acres,
approximately 100,000 to 225,000 square feet of gross leasable area). Visitor-
serving commercial uses (e.g., hotel and restaurants) oriented toward the
district's existing golf course are also permitted within the RRMP District.
The hotel may include a maximum of 250 rooms with ancillary retail, conference,
restaurant, and recreational uses. Visitor-serving commercial uses may occupy a
total of 20 acres at a maximum building intensity of 0.50 floor area ratio.
   (C)   Uses otherwise permitted in the city may be included in the RRMP
District, provided such uses are shown on the approved final development plan
for the district and are in accordance with the General Plan.
(Measure K Initiative, adopted 11-8-05)
§ 9-5.4103 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   A proposed final development plan for the RRMP District shall be
submitted to city staff for review and recommendation by the Planning
Commission and approval by the City Council. The Community Development
Department shall, from time to time, issue reasonable application content
requirements with which the proposed final development plan application must
comply. The final development plan shall be subject to the Residential
Development Allocation Program set forth in Article 40. Following a public
hearing, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City
Council based on substantial consistency with the General Plan and this article
and a review of the environmental impacts of the plan, the appropriateness and
interrelationship of the proposed uses, any effects on traffic circulation due
to development of the plan, the quality of the suggested site plan design and
other details of the proposed development plan. In considering the final
development plan at its public hearing, the Commission shall also determine its
appropriateness based on its ability to meet the purpose of this article. A
favorable recommendation must include the findings listed in this article for
the RRMP final development plan and any proposed conditions. In addition, the
Design Review Board must review the design features of the proposal (e.g.,
architecture, landscaping, signage) and any conditions of approval imposed by
the Design Review Board shall be included in the recommendation to the Council.
At its public hearing, the Council may decide to approve, conditionally
approve, or deny the final development plan or return the matter to the
Planning Commission or the Design Review Board, as appropriate, for further
evaluation.
   (B)   (1)   A use permit shall be required prior to the construction of any
phase of the approved final development plan for the RRMP District. It is the
intent of the use permit to further clarify the details of the development
phase being considered and to ensure that each component complies with the
established provisions of the final development plan, including any conditions
of approval attached to the final development plan. The use permit is not
intended to obtain further exactions of the developer but it is to refine the
final development plan and implement the conditions of approval attached to the
final development plan. Use permit approval shall be required prior to final
map recordation for all projects within the RRMP District.
      (2)   A use permit may be granted by the Zoning Administrator or the
Planning Commission, provided that the proposed development phase is in
substantial conformance with the approved final development plan and the
conditions thereof.
(Measure K Initiative, adopted 11-8-05)
§ 9-5.4104 RELATIONSHIP TO LAND SUBDIVISION.
   In situations where a subdivision of land (e.g., a tentative map) is
undertaken in conjunction with the approval of the final development plan, such
subdivision and approval may be processed concurrently.

   A request for modifications to the final development or any conditions of
approval thereof shall be treated as a new application, unless the Zoning

overall final development plan and are consistent with the intent of the
original approval.
(Measure K Initiative, adopted 11-8-05)
ARTICLE 42: PROHIBITION ON CONVERSION OF SENIOR MOBILEHOME PARKS
§ 9-5.4201 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Mobilehome parks represent one of a few affordable housing options
left to senior citizens that permit exclusive residence in a detached dwelling
by those individuals over the age of 55 years.
   (B)   Senior mobilehome parks afford seniors the ability to live in their
own homes rather than in apartments and provide a senior living community in
low-rise setting that typically provides a clubhouse for community events and
socializing as well as recreation facilities inside the park so that the
residents can easily walk to these facilities and events. Many of the seniors
living in senior mobilehome parks enjoy having their grandchildren visit them
in the parks, but they, like the seniors without grandchildren, purchased
mobilehomes in a senior park in order to live in a quieter community with
others in their own age group and purchased their homes in these parks because
they were senior parks that only accepted prospective purchasers of homes in
the park if at least one occupant of the mobilehome being purchased was 55
years or older.
   (C)   Residents of senior mobilehome parks relied upon the representation of
the park management and park owners that only seniors could purchase homes in
those parks and obtain tenancies in those parks. These representations were set
forth in the leases or rental agreements they were required to sign upon
purchasing a mobilehome in the parks and moving into the parks and in the rules
of those parks, which the residents were also required to sign and acknowledge.
Now some owners of senior mobilehome parks have indicated that they can and may
change their parks from senior mobilehome parks to family parks, over the
objections of their senior residents, by changing park rules using the
procedure in Cal. Civil Code § 798.25.
   (D)   While the seniors now living in senior mobilehome parks could remain
in a park after it changes to an all ages mobilehome park, those seniors would
no longer enjoy the companionship of a senior community and would likely lose
the quiet environment that generally exists within these communities. A limited
supply of senior parks exists and allowing conversion of those parks would most
likely result in diminished supply and fewer housing options for senior
citizens. Moreover, since mobilehomes are not mobile in any practical sense due
to the high cost of moving a home, the risk of damage to the home in moving,
the loss of improvements such as porches, patios, carports, and landscaping,
which cannot be moved, and the lack of available rental spaces in senior parks,
or in any mobilehome park in the city or surrounding areas that will accept re-
locating homes, senior residents of a mobilehome park that becomes an all ages
mobilehome park would have to sell the homes in which they have lived for many
years and in which they have invested both financial and personal resources in
order to move to another senior facility. After selling their mobilehomes,
these seniors may no longer have sufficient funds to purchase a mobilehome in
another senior park or senior facility. The aforementioned factors make it
unlikely that seniors would be able to relocate to another senior mobilehome
community if the park owner converted their senior mobilehome park to an all
ages mobilehome park.
   (E)   Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution authorizes cities
to adopt local police, sanitary, and other ordinances not in conflict with
general laws.
   (F)   The California Legislature has authorized cities to provide zoning for
senior-only mobilehome parks pursuant to Cal. Health and Safety Code § 18300.
   (G)   Prior to the adoption of this article, the City Council determined
that an urgency ordinance was necessary to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the city, and further determined upon that basis
that an urgency ordinance was necessary to prohibit conversions of senior-only
mobilehome park conversions within the city. Accordingly, an initial urgency
ordinance was approved on August 8, 2017, which was effective for 45 days from
the date of that adoption (i.e., until September 22, 2017). Then, the City
Council approved a second urgency ordinance, which was effective for 22 months
and 15 days from the expiration of the first urgency ordinance (i.e., until
August 7, 2019).
   (H)   Prior to the expiration of the moratorium, the City Council adopted
this article, finding that the permanent extension of the prohibition on
conversion of senior mobilehome parks to all-ages mobilehome parks was
necessary to protect the supply of affordable housing for seniors within city
limits and, thus, was necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
(Ord. 2168-C-S, passed 6-25-19)
§ 9-5.4202 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   For purpose of this article, the term CHANGE OF USE shall have the
same meaning as stated in Cal. Civil Code § 798.10.
   (B)   For purpose of this article, the term MOBILE HOME PARK shall have the
same meaning as stated in Cal. Health and Safety Code § 18214.

mean any mobilehome park where, on the effective date of this article, the
number of full-time residents younger than 55 years of age comprised 20.01% or
more of the total number of residents in the mobilehome park.
(Ord. 2168-C-S, passed 6-25-19)
§ 9-5.4203 PROHIBITION ON CONVERSION.
   No senior mobilehome park existing on the effective date of this article
shall, from the effective date of this article and thereafter, convert to or
become an all-ages mobilehome park. This prohibition shall be effective for any
mobile home park subject to this article until such time as the mobile home
park has complied with Cal. Civil Code § 798.56(g) and all other applicable
statutes, regulations, and ordinances regarding the change of use of the
property in which the mobile home park is located.

and administered in a manner consistent with the Costa- Hawkins Rental Housing
Act codified in Cal. Civil Code §§ 1954.50, et seq. ("Costa-Hawkins"), if any
conflict exists between the provisions of Costa-Hawkins and this chapter,
Costa-Hawkins shall prevail.
(Ord. 2219-C-S, passed 10-11-22; Am. Ord. 2227-C-S, passed 6-27-2023)
§ 11-3.03 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      HOUSING SERVICES. All amenities and services related to the use or
occupancy of a rental unit and common areas that are provided by the landlord.
HOUSING SERVICES includes without limitation hot and cold water, heat,
utilities, painting, elevator service, refuse removal, janitorial service,
maintenance, repairs, replacement, recreational areas (including pools or
gyms), laundry facilities, furnishings, storage space, parking (including one
or more automobiles), employee services, security services, insurance, the
payment of property taxes, and any other benefits or privileges permitted to
the tenant by agreement, whether express or implied, including the right to
have a specific number of occupants and the right to one-for-one replacement of
roommates, regardless of any prohibition against subletting and/or assignment.
HOUSING SERVICES also includes those basic housing services required by Cal.
Civil Code § 1941.1. HOUSING SERVICES includes a proportionate part of services
provided to common facilities of the building and property in which the rental
unit is contained.
      LANDLORD. An owner of record, lessor, sublessor or any other person,
entity, or nonnatural person entitled to receive rent for the use or occupancy
of any dwelling place subject to this Rent Stabilization chapter, or an agent
representative, affiliate, member, shareholder, trustee, or successor of any of
the foregoing. If an owner of a rental unit is other than a single natural
person, then all entities and persons that share ownership and/or control
(direct or indirect) of the units under this Rent Stabilization chapter shall
be considered one and the same landlord.
      RENT. The sum of all consideration demanded accepted, or retained for the
use or occupancy of a rental unit or for housing services provided, or both.
RENT includes all periodic payments and all nonmonetary consideration,
including, but not limited to, the fair market value of goods or services
rendered to or for the benefit of the landlord, under an agreement concerning
the use or occupancy of residential real property.
   (B)   Terms defined in other sections of this Rent Stabilization chapter
shall have such meaning when used in this Rent Stabilization chapter, whether
singular or plural.
(Ord. 2219-C-S, passed 10-11-22; Am. Ord. 2227-C-S, passed 6-27-2023)
§ 11-3.04 LIMIT ON RENTAL RATE INCREASES.
   (A)   Increases in rent on residential real property in the city may not
exceed the lesser of 3% or 60% of the most recent 12-month increase in the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the San Francisco-Oakland-
Hayward Area published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Only one rent
increase in any 12 month period is permitted. A reduction in housing services
is an increase in rent.
   (B)   Division (A) of this section shall apply to all rent increases
occurring on or after August 23, 2022.
      (1)   In the event that a landlord has increased the rent by more than
the amount permissible under division (A) between August 23, 2022 and the
effective date of this Rent Stabilization chapter, the applicable rent on the
effective date of this Rent Stabilization chapter shall be the rent as it
existed on August 23, 2022 plus the maximum permissible increase authorized
under division (A) of this section and applicable state law, if any.
      (2)   A landlord has no duty to refund otherwise lawful rent received
prior to the effective date of this Rent Stabilization chapter in excess of the
amount authorized by this section.
   (C)   The 12 month period referenced in division (A) of this section shall
begin on the date of the last rent increase regardless of whether the last
increase occurred prior to the effective date of the Rent Stabilization
chapter.
   (D)   The City Council finds that the limited retroactive effect enacted by
divisions (B) and (C) of this section are necessary to counteract any rent
increases imposed in anticipation of the adoption of rent stabilization in the
city and to more fully effectuate the legislative and public purposes of this
Rent Stabilization chapter.
(Ord. 2219-C-S, passed 10-11-22; Am. Ord. 2227-C-S, passed 6-27-2023)
§ 11-3.05 REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN.
   This Rent Stabilization chapter allows for an annual adjustment of
residential real property rent of up to the lesser of 3% or 60% of the Consumer
Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward Area
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics pursuant to § 11-3.04. Such an
increase is found and determined to provide a just and reasonable return on a
landlord's property, and has been adopted to encourage good management, reward
efficiency, and discourage the flight of capital, as well as to be commensurate
with returns on comparable investments, but not so high as to defeat the
purpose of curtailing excessive rents and rental increases. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any landlord who contends that the limit on rental increases set
forth in §
11-3.04 will prevent the landlord from receiving a fair and reasonable return
on the property may petition for relief from the limit set forth in §
11-3.04 pursuant to the procedures set forth in §
11-3.07.
(Ord. 2219-C-S, passed 10-11-22; Am. Ord. 2227-C-S, passed 6-27-2023)
§ 11-3.06 TENANT PETITION FOR RENT REDUCTION.
   (A)   A tenant may petition for a reduction of rent ("rent reduction
petition") if the tenant believes that the landlord has demanded, accepted, or
retained fromthe tenant any rent in excess of the rent permitted by this Rent
Stabilization chapter. The landlord shall be informed of the tenant's complaint
and shall have the opportunity to respond to the tenant's claim of rent
overcharge.
      (1)   Such rent reduction petition shall be on an application form
prescribed by the City Attorney or designee and shall be decided by a Hearing
Officer subject to §
1-6.01 designated by the City Attorney.
      (2)   The tenant shall provide a copy of any rent reduction petition
submitted to the city to the applicable landlord and shall provide the city
with proof of completing such service to the applicable landlord. The landlord
shall have 30 days from the date of receiving the rent reduction petition to
reply or provide additional materials to the city in response to the rent
reduction petition.
      (3)   The tenant shall bear the burden of establishing that a rent
reduction is necessary to comply with the city's Rent Stabilization Ordinance
by providing information including the type of dwelling, dates of tenancy,
dates of rent increases, amount of rent increases, dates of charges, and
amounts of charges.
   (B)   The factors the Hearing Officer may consider in deciding a rent
reduction petition shall be matters related to the landlord's failure to comply
with the city's Rent Stabilization Ordinance and regulations. For example, the
amount of rent that the landlord has actually demanded, accepted, or retained
from the tenant exceeds the amount of rent that the landlord could lawfully
charge. The Hearing Officer may also consider a landlord's decrease of housing
services.
   (C)   A rent reduction petition shall be decided by the Hearing Officer
within 60 calendar days of the date that the application has been deemed
complete, including submission of proof of service of the rent reduction
petition on the applicable landlord(s), unless an extension of this time has
been agreed upon by the parties. The decision shall be sent by mail and shall
be emailed with proof of mailing to the applicable tenant(s), the designated
representative of the tenant(s), the subject landlord, and the landlord's
designated representative(s) for the rent reduction petition, if any. The
decision of the Hearing Officer shall be the final decision.

§ 11-3.07 LANDLORD PETITION FOR RENT INCREASE.
   (A)   A landlord may petition for a rent increase in excess of that provided
in §
11-3.04 in order to obtain a fair and reasonable return on the landlord's
property ("fair return petition").
      (1)   Such fair return petition shall be on an application form
prescribed by the City Attorney or designee and shall be decided by a Hearing
Officer subject to §
1-6.01 designated by the City Attorney.
      (2)   The landlord shall provide a copy of any fair return petition
submitted to the city to the applicable tenant(s) and shall provide the city
with proof of completing such service to the applicable tenant(s). The tenant
(s) shall have 30 days from the date of receiving the fair return petition to
reply or provide additional materials to the city in response to the fair
return petition.
      (3)   The landlord shall bear the burden of establishing that a rate
increase in excess of that provided in §
11-3.04 is necessary to provide the landlord with a fair and reasonable return
on the property, including by providing an independent financial report and
verified financial data demonstrating that without such an increase, the
landlord will not realize a fair and reasonable return on the property.
      (4)   The landlord shall be responsible for all costs associated with the

requests the offer in writing within 30 days after the landlord has notified
the city of an intention to offer the rental unit again for residential rent or
lease. The landlord of the rental unit shall be liable to any tenant who was
displaced by that faction for failure to comply with this division, for

constructed on the same property, and offered for rent or lease within five
years of the date the rental units were withdrawn from rent or lease, the newly
