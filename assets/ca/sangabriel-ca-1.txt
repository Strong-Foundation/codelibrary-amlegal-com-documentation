provisions or failing to comply with any of the requirements of this code shall

offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any
provisions of this code or of a city ordinance is committed, continued, or
permitted by such person and shall be punished accordingly.

§ 11.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council hereby finds that there is a need for an alternative
method of enforcement for violators of the Municipal Code. The City Council
further finds that an appropriate method for enforcement for violation is an
Administrative Citation Program as authorized by Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.4 that
will reduce the burden on the judicial system while providing full due process
for those cited.
   (B)   The procedures established in this chapter are in addition to
criminal, civil or other legal remedies that may be available to the city to
enforce violations of the Municipal Code.
   (C)   The City Council finds and determines that enforcement of the
provisions of the San Gabriel Municipal Code are municipal affairs as well as
matters of purely local concern to the citizens of San Gabriel.
   (D)   The City Council finds that the adoption and implementation of this

refuse to comply with the provisions of the Municipal Code in the city;

responsible person must comply with the administrative order, or seek judicial

APPEALS TO COUNCIL
§ 30.10 FINDINGS.
   The Council has found that in some provisions of this code there is no
definite procedure set out for an appeal to the Council from the findings,
decision, or action of an administrative officer, employee, board, or
commission created or appointed by the Council and that the wording of some
code provisions can be construed as leaving the final decision of a matter in
the hands of some subordinate person, board, body, or commission without appeal
to the Council. From such finding the Council believes there should always be a
means of relief for a person aggrieved by an arbitrary finding, decision, or
action of such appointive person, body, or commission, without resort to the
overcrowded courts of law.
('65 Code, § 1-4.01) (Ord. 843, passed - - )
§ 30.11 FILING.
   Where no specific provision is made or procedure is set out in this code or

person aggrieved by the findings, decision, or action of any subordinate
officer, employee, board, body, or commission may, within ten days from the
date of notice of such findings, decision, or action, file his written notice
of appeal therefrom with the City Clerk, giving his name and mailing address.
Where there is a specific appellate procedure applicable to the subject matter,
that procedure shall govern and these general appellate procedures shall be
inapplicable.
('65 Code, § 1-4.02) (Ord. 843, passed - - )
§ 30.12 STAY OF ACTION.
   The City Clerk shall forthwith notify the officer, employee, board, body or
commission of the filing of such notice of appeal, and all action pertaining to
the subject matter of the appeal shall be suspended until final action of the
Council therefrom unless delay of action of the matter directly endangers
public health and safety.
('65 Code, § 1-4.03) (Ord. 843, passed - - )
§ 30.13 REFERRAL TO COUNCIL.
   The City Clerk shall refer the filing of the notice of appeal to the Council
at its first regular meeting after receipt thereof, or at a special meeting
called for such purpose and shall, at the Council's direction, set the appeal
for hearing.
('65 Code, § 1-4.04) (Ord. 843, passed - - )
§ 30.14 NOTICE OF HEARING.
   The City Clerk shall notify the appellant of such date by mail and so notify
any other person requesting notice thereof.
('65 Code, § 1-4.07) (Ord. 843, passed - - )
§ 30.15 DECISION OF THE COUNCIL FOLLOWING HEARING.
   At the date and hour set for the public hearing, the appellant shall be
heard, and the Council shall hear such relevant and material testimony and
argument as shall be presented by the appellant or his counsel and the
testimony and argument, if any, by the respondent person or body, commission or
other person affected in the premises as in other appeals provided by this
code, by ordinance, or by state law.
('65 Code, § 1-4.08) (Ord. 843, passed - - )

BIDDER shall mean that bidder whose bid best serves the interests of the city
in the opinion of the Council and the Purchasing Officer based upon
considerations of price, quality, service, fitness, ability of the bidder to
deliver, ability of the bidder to deliver on time and within budget,
availability of parts and/or service, prior experience with the bidder, and any
other factors relating to the particular needs of the city for the supplies or
equipment to be purchased.
   (B)   Notices inviting bids. Notices inviting bids shall be posted at least
ten days before the date of opening of the bids on the city's website and shall
be posted in at least one public place in the city that has been designated for
the posting of public notices. The notice shall include a general description
of the articles to be purchased, shall state where bid forms and specifications
may be secured, and give the time and place for receipt and opening of the
bids. All such bids shall be filed with the City Clerk and opened by the City
Clerk at the time and place specified in the notices inviting bids. Any bidder

Purchasing Officer shall evaluate all bids and present his/her recommendation
as to the lowest responsible bidder to the Council, together with a summary of
all bids received.
   (C)   Bidders list. When the Purchasing Officer elects to establish a

interest and necessity to purchase supplies, services, or equipment without
compliance with the formal contract procedures set forth in this section, the

an existing proprietary article or process, or in which a warranty, guarantee
or other assurances could be voided. Purchases in excess of $25,000 require
City Council approval.
   (D)   Contracting for services in which an applicant deposits 100% of the
costs of such service and agrees to replenish a deposit account for any
additional costs incurred under the professional service agreement. The
professional services to be contracted shall be contractually obligated to the
city for purposes of oversight and supervision, not the applicant, and no
public funds will be a source of any payment to the service provider under that
specific contract. These contracts do not require City Council approval
regardless of dollar amount.

§ 34.37 EMERGENCY PURCHASES.
   (A)   When an emergency requires immediate purchase of supplies and
equipment, the department concerned shall, after approval by the City Manager,
or acting City Manager, or in the event of his or her absence or
unavailability, the Finance Director, or, in the case of the absence of both,
on its own authority, immediately deliver a purchase order to the City
Manager's office, which will expedite verification of funds available and
complete the preparation of the purchase order, returning the vendor's copy to
the ordering department "on the spot" to enable an immediate purchase.
   (B)   If, at the time of the emergency, the Purchasing Officer is
unavailable, the department head, having obtained prior approval in accordance

and limitations contained in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Division 2, Part 1.5;
   (B)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as these
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Division 2, Part 1.5;
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which imposes a 1% tax and provides a
measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of
Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practical to, and
requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes; and
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which can be administered in a manner
that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Cal. Rev. &
Tax. Code Division 2, Part 1.5, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and
use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this subchapter.

§ 35.037 SALES TAX.

retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate 1%
of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal
property sold at retail in the city on and after the operative date of this
subchapter.
      (2)   For the purposes of this subchapter, all retail sales are
consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible
personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-
state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state
destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges,
when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the
place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place
of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or
places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under
rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of
Equalization.
   (B)   (1)   Except as hereinafter provided, and except insofar as they are

word is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer,
the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, or the name of the
state treasury, or of the Constitution of the State of California; nor shall
the name of the city be substituted for that of the state in any section when
the results of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against
the city, or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Board of
Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or
operation of this subchapter; and neither shall the substitution be deemed to
have been made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to,
sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of
the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to
certain gross receipts which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while
those gross receipts remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of
Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Division 2, Part. 1; nor to impose this tax with respect
to certain gross receipts which would not be subject to tax by the state under
the said provisions of that code; and, in addition, the name of the city shall
not be substituted for that of the state in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 6701, 6702

& Tax. Code § 6067, an additional seller's permit shall not be required by
reason of this section.
      (4)   There shall be excluded from the gross receipts by which the tax is
measured:

retailer or consumer; and

retailer on or after the operative date of this subchapter for storage, use or

property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are

made.
   (B)   (1)   Except as hereinafter provided, and except insofar as they are
inconsistent with the provisions of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Division 2, Part 1.5,

      (2)   Wherever, and to the extent that, in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Division
2, Part 1, the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the city
shall be substituted therefor. Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to
require the substitution of the name of the city for the word “state” when that
word is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer,
the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the name of the
state treasury, or the Constitution of the State; nor shall the name of the
city be substituted for that of the state in any section when the result of
that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or
any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization,
in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
subchapter; and neither shall the substitution be deemed to have been made in
those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring
to the exterior boundaries of the state where the result of the substitution
would be to provide an exemption from such tax with respect to certain storage,
use, or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not
otherwise be exempt from such tax while such storage, use, or other consumption
remains subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Cal. Rev. and Tax.
Code Division 2, Part 1, or to impose such tax with respect to certain storage,
use, or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be
subject to tax by the state under the said provisions of the state code; and,
in addition, the name of the city shall not be substituted for that of the
state in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence
thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 and 6828 as adopted, and the name of the city
shall not be substituted for the word “state” in the phrase “retailer engaged
in business in this state” in Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code § 6203 nor in the

§ 35.056 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, or
intended or designed for occupancy, by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes and shall include any hotel, inn, tourist home or house,
motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment

   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this subchapter and shall have
the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter by either the principal or the managing agent,
however, shall be considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.
   RENT. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, property, and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for
a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar
days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be
deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired, unless there
is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for
a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date of the provisions of this subchapter may be considered.
('65 Code, § 3-6.302) (Ord. 925, passed - - )
§ 35.057 TAX IMPOSED.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject
to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the
operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient to the city,
which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the
city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time
the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of
the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon
the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax
due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Finance Director may require
that such tax be paid directly to him.

§ 35.059 OPERATOR'S DUTIES.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by the provisions of this
subchapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected
from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the
amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for
payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in
any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof,
will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to
the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner
provided in this subchapter.

fraud, a penalty in the amount of 25% of the amount of the tax shall be added
thereto in addition to the penalties set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this
section.
   (D)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who shall

any portion thereof, required by the provisions of this subchapter, the Finance
Director shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain the facts
and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the
Finance Director shall procure such facts and information as he is able to
obtain upon which to base the assessment of any such tax imposed by the
provisions of this subchapter and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Finance
Director shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax,
interest, and penalties provided for by the provisions of this subchapter. In
the event such determination is made, the Finance Director shall give notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
his last known place of address. Such operator may, within ten days after the
service or mailing of such notice, make an application in writing to the
Finance Director for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the Finance Director shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such an
application is made, the Finance Director shall give not less than five days
written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show
cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein
should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing the
operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and
penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing the Finance Director shall
determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the operator in the manner prescribed in this section of such
determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days the service or mailing of

Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 10 days after
the service or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Council shall
fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give
notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The
decision of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed in this subchapter for the service of a
notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.

is a rebuttable presumption that communication services, which are billed to a
billing or service address in the city, are used, in whole or in part, within
the city’s boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this
subchapter. If the billing address of the service user is different from the
service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for

services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the
Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in
another state or city on such communication services, shall be allowed a credit
against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed
in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not
exceed the tax owed to the city under this section.

   (A)   Any service user subject to the tax imposed by §

35.083 of this subchapter, which produces gas or electricity for self-use;
which receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services,
directly from a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this
subchapter; or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax

evidence, or, if the administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion
of the Tax Administrator is excessive, the Tax Administrator may determine the
tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would
have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related
supplemental services, had been provided by the service supplier that is the
primary supplier of gas or electricity within the city. Rate schedules for this
purpose shall be available from the city.

§ 35.086 BUNDLING TAXABLE ITEMS WITH NON-TAXABLE ITEMS.
   If any non-taxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from
taxable service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier,
the combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies,
by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge
that are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier’s books and
records kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for
tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper
apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges. If the service supplier
offers a combination of taxable and non-taxable services, and the charges are
separately stated, then for taxation purposes, the values assigned the taxable
and non-taxable services shall be based on its books and records kept in the
regular course of business and in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. The service
supplier has the burden of proving the proper valuation of the taxable and non-
taxable services.

§ 35.086.5 SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS/MINIMUM CONTACTS.
   For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a
tax under this subchapter, “substantial nexus” and “minimum contacts” shall be
construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of
the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law,
and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by
statutory enactment. Any communication service (including VOIP) used by a
person with a service address in the city, which service is capable of
terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be
subject to a rebuttable presumption that substantial nexus/minimum contacts
exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and
remit a tax, under this subchapter. A service supplier shall be deemed to have
sufficient activity in the city for tax collection and remittance purposes if
its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains
or has within the city, directly or through an agent, affiliate or subsidiary,
a place of business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees,
independent contractors, resellers, agents or other representatives; solicits
business in the city on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by
means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter within the
city or distributed from a location with the city; or advertises in newspapers
or other periodicals printed and published within the city or through materials
distributed in the city by means other than the United States mail; or if there
are activities performed in the city on behalf of the service supplier that are
significantly associated with the service supplier’s ability to establish and
maintain a market in the city for the provision of services that are subject to
a tax under this subchapter.

§ 35.087 TEMPORARY REBATES FOR EXTRAORDINARY UTILITY COSTS.
   (A)   The City Council, by resolution, may grant a temporary utility users
tax rebate to any class of service users for the purpose of easing the tax
burden on such customer class, which is due to an unusually large increase in
the service charges for a particular utility industry subject to the utility
users tax. The City Council may rebate an appropriate percentage of the tax
prospectively for a period of no more than 12 months. If applicable, the Tax
Administrator shall implement the temporary tax rebate by giving 60 day written
notice to all affected service suppliers as required by Cal. Pub. Util. Code §
799.
   (B)   The City Council shall consider the following factors in determining
whether to grant a temporary tax rebate under this section:
      (1)   The amount of the increase in the average billing for the utility
service for which a rebate is being considered;
      (2)   The severity of the burden that the increased billing and
associated tax imposes on the customer class for which a rebate is being
considered;
      (3)   The increased expense to the city as a utility customer, which
occurs as a result of the increase in the cost of such utility service;
      (4)   The estimated time period that the billing increase will likely
persist;
      (5)   The forecasted and historical increases or decreases in the other
sources of utility users tax;
      (6)   The forecasted and historical increases or decreases in municipal
tax revenues other than the utility users tax;
      (7)   The overall inflation rate during relevant time periods, as
measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI);
      (8)   The cost of administering the rebate; and,
      (9)   Any other factor that affects the fairness or equity of granting
such a temporary rebate.
   (C)   In a resolution granting a temporary tax rebate, the City Council
shall make the following findings:
      (1)   The temporary tax rebate is necessary to abate a significantly
increased tax burden on a class of service users; and,
      (2)   The temporary tax rebate shall not adversely affect the city’s
ability to meet its financial obligations as contemplated in its current
budget.
   (D)   Nothing herein shall prohibit the City Council from granting
consecutive temporary rebates, provided that the City Council reconsiders the
factors enumerated in division (B), above, for each subsequent temporary
rebate, and makes appropriate findings for each resolution. As stated in Cal.
Gov’t Code § 9611, the enactment of a temporary tax rebate by the City Council
shall not constitute a repeal of one or more of the original provisions of this
subchapter. Upon the expiration of the time of the temporary tax rebate, the
original provisions of this subchapter shall have the same force and effect as
if the temporary tax rebate had not been enacted. Nothing herein is intended to
constitute a decrease in a tax, or an increase in a tax requiring an election
approval under California Constitution Article XIIIC; and to the extent that
any aspect of a temporary tax rebate resolution is found to invoke such a
requirement, the entire temporary rebate resolution shall be deemed null and
void ab initio, and there shall be no entitlement to a rebate for any service
user.

§ 35.088 DELINQUENCY; INTEREST.
   (A)   Taxes collected from a service user, or owed by a service user subject
to §
35.085 of this subchapter are delinquent if not received by the Tax
Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend
or legal holiday, the return must be received by the Tax Administrator on or
before the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A
direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods
of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a
service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this division shall
be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date,
and the transfer settles into the city’s account on or before the following
business day.
   (B)   If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users tax
fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more
services or charges on the customer’s billing) or fails to remit the tax
collected on or before the due date, or, in the case of a service user that
fails to properly self-collect and remit the tax on or before the due date
under §
35.085 of this subchapter, the Tax Administrator shall attach a penalty for
such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of 15% of the total tax that is
delinquent or deficient in the remittance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
person required to collect and/or remit the utility users tax shall not be
subject to the 15% penalty and interest for an “improper assessment” if such
“improper assessment” is voluntarily disclosed to the Tax Administrator, or its
agent, and promptly corrected thereafter by such person, whether the disclosure
occurs in the course of a Tax Administrator survey under §§
35.081(C),
35.082(D),
35.083(D), and
35.084(D) or the disclosure is voluntarily initiated by such person. For
purposes of this division, the term VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSED shall mean
information freely offered by a service supplier to the city for the purpose of
increasing the accuracy of the service supplier’s tax collection and/or
remittances before the issue has been raised or an inquiry has been initiated
by the city or any other California municipality.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional
penalties upon persons required to collect and/or remit taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this subchapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or
remitting at the rate of 15% of the amount of the tax collected and/or required
to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.
   (D)   In addition to any other penalties imposed by this subchapter, any
person required to collect and/or remit any tax imposed by the provisions of
this subchapter who fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the
tax on one or more services or charges on the customer’s billing) or fails to
remit the tax collected on or before the due date, or, in the case of a service
user that fails to properly self-collect and remit the tax under §
35.085 of this subchapter on or before the due date, shall pay interest at the
rate of 3/4 of 1% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent, until paid.
   (E)   The interest accrued under the provision of this section shall become
a part of the tax required to be paid.

§ 35.089 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this
subchapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any
such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax
Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to
collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person
owing money to the city under the provisions of this subchapter shall be liable
to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount,
including penalties and interest as provided for in this subchapter, along with
any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person’s
noncompliance with this subchapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys fees.

§ 35.090 DUTY TO COLLECT; PROCEDURE.
   The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by this
subchapter shall be performed as follows:
   (A)   The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as
and along with the charges made in accordance with the regular billing
practices of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a
service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which has
accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and
the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user
has notified the service supplier of  his or her  refusal to pay the tax
imposed on the energy charges, §
35.093(B) will apply.
   (B)   The duty of a service supplier to collect tax from a service user
shall commence with the beginning of the first full regular billing period
applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such
regular billing are subject to the provisions of this subchapter. Where a
person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods
than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing.
(‘65 Code, § 3-6.509) (Ord. 390-C.S., passed - - ; Am. Ord. Measure A, passed -
 - )
§ 35.091 DUTY TO REMIT; PROCEDURES.
   Each person required by this subchapter to remit a tax shall file a return
with the Tax Administrator on forms approved by the Tax Administrator on or
before the due date. The full amount of the tax owed shall be included with the
return and filed with the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator is
authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems necessary
to determine if the tax is being levied, collected and remitted in accordance
with this subchapter. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason. Pursuant to Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7284.6, the Tax
Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as
confidential information, and not subject to the Public Records Act.
(Ord. Measure A, passed - - )
§ 35.092 ADDITIONAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty to enforce each
and all of the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations
consistent with provisions of this subchapter for the purpose of interpreting,
clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance
of the taxes herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a new
tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this section or increase
an existing tax, except as allowed by Cal. Gov’t Code § 53750(h)(2). A copy of
such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax
Administrator’s office. To the extent that the Tax Administrator determines
that the tax imposed under this subchapter shall not be collected in full for
any period of time from any particular service supplier or service user, that
determination shall be considered an exercise of the Tax Administrator’s
discretion to settle disputes and shall not constitute a change in taxing
methodology for purposes of Cal. Gov’t Code § 53750 or otherwise. The Tax
Administrator is not authorized to amend the city’s methodology for purposes of
Cal. Gov’t Code § 53750 and the city does not waive or abrogate its ability to
impose the communication users’ tax in full as a result of promulgating
administrative rulings or entering into agreements.
   (C)   Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make
administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict
requirements of this subchapter and thereby:
      (1)   Conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier
so long as the agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance
with the general purpose and scope of this subchapter; or
      (2)   To avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection
and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement
shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office, and are voidable by the Tax
Administrator or the city at any time.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper
compliance with the requirements of this subchapter, of any person required to
collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this subchapter. The Tax Administrator
shall notify the person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the
absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review
shall not exceed a period of three years next preceding the date of receipt of
the written notice by the person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of
the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant
to this subchapter for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed
and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax
Administrator. If the person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient
records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this
subchapter, the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate
of the deficiency. The reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable
presumption of correctness.
   (E)   Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause,
the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required
pursuant to this subchapter for a period of not to exceed 45 days, provided
that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the
request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason
of such extension. Interest shall accrue during the extension at the rate of
0.75% per month, prorated for any portion thereof.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person
who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of the tax imposed by this
subchapter.
   (G)   Notwithstanding any provision in this subchapter to the contrary, the
Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person
required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this
subchapter if the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether
the non-collection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into
consideration industry practice or other precedence.
(‘65 Code, §3-6.510) (Ord. 578, passed 11-4-08)
§ 35.093 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY; SERVICE USERS.
   (A)   Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has
deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the
amounts remitted to a service supplier required to collect the tax, that a
service user has failed to pay the amount of tax for a period of two or more
billing periods, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best
interest of the city, the Tax Administrator may relieve such person of the
obligation to collect taxes due under this subchapter from certain named
service users for specified billing periods. The service supplier shall provide
the city with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of
taxes owed under the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator shall notify the service user that he or she has
assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and
demand payment of the taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by
handing it to  him or her  personally or by deposit of the notice in the United
States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the
address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax;
or, should the service user have changed his or her address, to his or her last
known address.
   (C)   If a service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator
within 15 days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her,
which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person,
the Tax Administrator may assess the delinquent service user for the required
tax pursuant to §
35.094 of this subchapter.
(‘65 Code, § 3-6.511) (Ord. 390-C.S., passed - - ; Am. Ord. Measure A, passed -
 - )
§ 35.094 ASSESSMENTS.
   The Tax Administrator may make an assessment for taxes not paid or remitted
by a person required to pay or remit. The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice
of such assessment, which shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes,
penalties and interest imposed and the time and place where the assessment may
be contested, to the service supplier and/or the service user at least ten days
prior to the date of the hearing and shall post such notice for at least five
continuous days prior to the date of the hearing. A penalty of 25% of the
amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, along with interest
at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of
the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent, until paid, but not less than $5. Any interested party
having any objections may appear and be heard at the hearing provided his or
her objection is filed in writing with the Tax Administrator, within 14
calendar days of the date of the notice. At the time fixed for considering such
assessment, the Tax Administrator shall hear the same, together with any
objections filed as provided in this section, and thereupon may confirm or
modify such assessment.
(Ord. Measure A, passed --)
§ 35.095 RECORDS.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit
to the city any tax imposed by this subchapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of at least three years, all records as may be necessary to determine
the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of
and remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator
shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.
   (B)   The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to
deliver, to the Tax Administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by
the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this subchapter, including
the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available
media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and
ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed
records to the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the
administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside
the city on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse
the city for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect
those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses,
but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by
the city to conduct the inspection.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure
agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the confidentiality of
customer information pursuant to Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 7284.6 and 7284.7.
The Tax Administrator may request from a person providing transportation or
distribution services of gas or electricity to service users within the city, a
list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities of gas or
electricity delivered, and other pertinent information, of its transportation
customers within the city pursuant to Cal. Pub. Util. Code § 6354(e).
   (D)   If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to
bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: (i) provide to
the Tax Administrator the name, address, and telephone number of each billing
agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to
bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and (ii) upon request of the
Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or
records in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in
the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is necessary to verify the proper
application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the city.
   (E)   If any person subject to record-keeping under this section
unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator, or the Tax Administrator’s
designated representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the
information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified,
the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of $500 on such person for each day
following: (i) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access;
or (ii) the due date for production of records as set forth in the
administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty
imposed under this subchapter.

§ 35.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid, paid more than once,
or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax
Administrator under this subchapter, it may be refunded as provided in this
section.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid, paid
more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by
the Tax Administrator under this subchapter, provided that no refund shall be
paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her
guardian, conservator, executor or administrator has submitted a written claim,
under penalty of perjury, to the Tax Administrator within one year of the
overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must
clearly establish claimant’s right to the refund by written records showing
entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a refund claim
on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers. Where the amount of any individual
refund claim is in excess of $15,000, City Council approval shall be required.
   (C)   It is the intent of the city that the one year written claim
requirement of this section be given retroactive effect, provided, however,
that any claims which arose prior to the enactment of the one year claims
period of this section, and which are not otherwise barred by a then-applicable
statute of limitations or claims procedure, must be filed with the Tax
Administrator as provided in this division within 90 days following the
effective date of this ordinance.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator, or the City Council where the claim is in
excess of $15,000, shall act upon the refund claim within 45 days of the
initial receipt of the refund claim. Said decision shall be final. If the Tax
Administrator/City Council fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the
45 day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the Tax
Administrator/City Council on the forty-fifth day. The Tax Administrator shall
give notice of the action in a form which substantially complies with that set
forth in Cal. Gov’t Code § 913.
   (E)   The filing of a written claim is a prerequisite to any suit thereon.
Any action brought against the city pursuant to this section shall be subject
to the provisions of Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 945.6 and 946.
   (F)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service
supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission,
makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services, the taxes
paid pursuant to this subchapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall
also be refunded to service users, and the service supplier shall be entitled
to claim a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is
due upon the next monthly returns. In the event this subchapter is repealed,
the amounts of any refundable taxes will be borne by the city.
   (G)   Notwithstanding divisions (B) and (C) above, a service supplier shall
be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit against an underpayment
whenever such overpayment has been received by the city within the three years
next preceding a notice of tax deficiency or assessment by the Tax
Administrator, or during any year for which the service supplier, at the
request of the Tax Administrator, has executed a waiver of the defense of the
statute of limitations with regard to any claim the city may have for a utility
users tax. A service supplier shall not be entitled to said credit unless it
clearly establishes the right to the credit by written records showing
entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a
credit against an underpayment pursuant to this division qualify a service
supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the
one-year written claim requirement of this section.

   (A)   The provisions of this section apply to any assessment, decision or
administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator, other than a decision relating
to a refund pursuant to §
35.096 of this subchapter. Any person aggrieved by any assessment, decision or
administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator, other than a decision relating
to a refund, shall be required to comply with the appeals procedure of this
section. Compliance with this section shall be a prerequisite to a suit
thereon. [See Cal. Gov’t Code § 935(b).] Nothing herein shall permit the filing
of a claim or action on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers.
   (B)   If any person is aggrieved by any assessment, decision or
administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator, other than a decision relating
to a refund; or with the failure of the Tax Administrator to grant an exemption
as provided for under this subchapter; he or she may appeal to the City Manager
by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 14 days of the date of
the assessment, decision or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator
which aggrieved the service user or service supplier.
   (C)   The matter shall be set for hearing no more than 30 days from the
receipt of the appeal. The appellant shall be served with notice of the time
and place of the hearing, as well as any relevant materials, at least five
calendar days prior to the hearing. The hearing may be continued from time to
time upon mutual consent. At the time of the hearing, the appealing party, the
Tax Administrator, the City Manager, and any other interested person may
present such relevant evidence as he or she may have relating to the
determination from which the appeal is taken.
   (D)   Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the
city’s files, the City Manager shall issue a written notice and order
upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is
taken. The notice shall be given within 14 days after the conclusion of the
hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall specify
that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be
filed within 90 days from the date of the decision in accordance with Cal. Civ.
Proc. Code § 1094.6. If the City Manager fails or refuses to act on a refund
claim within the 14 day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected
by the City Manager on the fourteenth day.
   (E)   No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process
shall issue in any suit, action, or proceeding in any court against this city
or against any officer of the city to prevent or enjoin the collection under

remitted.

§ 35.098 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon:
      (1)   Any person or service when the imposition of such tax upon that
person or service would be in violation of the Constitution or the laws of the
United States or of the State of California;
      (2)   The city; and,
      (3)   Any state or federal government entity, including public school
districts.
   (B)   Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this
subchapter pursuant to division (A) shall file an application with the Tax
Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not
apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a
commonly recognized name. Said application shall be made upon a form approved
by the Tax Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of
perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the
names of all utility service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed
exempt by the Tax Administrator, such service user shall give the Tax
Administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service suppliers
so that the Tax Administrator can properly notify the new utility service
supplier of the service user’s tax exempt status. A service user that fails to
comply with this section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users
taxes collected and remitted to the Tax Administrator from such service user as
a result of such non-compliance. Upon request of the Tax Administrator, a
service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, shall
provide a list of the names and addresses of those customers which, according
to its billing records, are deemed exempt from the utility users tax. A
telephone communication services supplier shall provide a copy of the federal
exemption certificate for each exempt customer within the city that is served
by such service supplier upon request of the Tax Administrator.
   (C)   The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to §
35.097 of this subchapter. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and
appeal to the City Manager pursuant to §
35.097 of this subchapter is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

§ 35.099 EXEMPTION FOR RESIDENTS.
   (A)   Any service user shall be eligible for an exemption from the taxes
imposed by this subchapter if the service user qualifies for either the
California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Programs of The Southern
California Gas Company or Southern California Edison Company, or qualifies for
the Lifeline Rate Program of Pacific Bell. Proof of such eligibility shall be
submitted by the service user to the Tax Administrator, pursuant to
administrative procedures promulgated by the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator shall maintain a list of all service users
exempt from the utility users tax, according to the provisions of division (A)
of this section. The Tax Administrator shall advise all of the service
providers required to collect and remit this tax of the names and service
addresses of exempt service users.
   (C)   An exemption shall automatically terminate with any change in the
service address or residence of the exempt service user, or assignment of a
different account number by the service supplier because of discontinuance or
suspension of service at the request of the service user; and provided further,
that such individual may nevertheless apply for a new exemption with each
change of address or residence.
   (D)   Any service user who has been exempted under this section shall notify
the Tax Administrator within ten days of any change in fact or circumstance
which might disqualify said individual from receiving such exemption. It shall
be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the benefits of the
exemption provided by this section when the basis for such exemption does not
exist or ceases to exist.
   (E)   Any service supplier, who determines by any means that a non-exempt
service user is receiving service through a meter or connection exempt by
virtue of an exemption issued to a previous user or exempt user of the same
meter or connection, shall immediately notify the Tax Administrator of such
fact, and the Tax Administrator shall conduct an investigation to ascertain
whether or not the provisions of this section have been complied with, and,
where appropriate, order the service supplier to commence collecting the tax
from the service user.

requirements of Cal. Pub. Util. Code § 799. Prior to the effective date of the
ordinance change, the service supplier shall provide the Tax Administrator with
a copy of any written procedures describing the information that the service
supplier needs to implement the ordinance change. If the service supplier fails

time to time, provided that such reference to a statute herein shall not
include any subsequent amendment thereto, or to any subsequent change of
interpretation thereto by a state or federal agency or court of law with the
duty to interpret such law, to the extent that such amendment or change of
interpretation would require voter approval under California law, or to the
extent that such change would result in a tax decrease (as a result of
excluding all or a part of a communication service, or charge therefor, from
taxation). Only to the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a
tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute (or interpretation)
shall remain applicable; for any application or situation that would not
require voter approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the
amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum
possible extent. To the extent that the city’s authorization to collect or
impose any tax imposed under this subchapter is expanded or limited as a result
of changes in state or federal law, no amendment or modification of this
subchapter shall be required to conform the tax to those changes, and the tax

§ 35.107 INTERACTION WITH PRIOR TAX.
   (A)   Collection of tax by service providers. Service providers shall begin

   (B)   Judicial determinations. In the event that a final court order should
determine that the election enacting the amendments to this subchapter is

continuation shall be effective beginning as of the first date of service (or
billing date) for which the tax imposed by this subchapter is not valid.
However, in the event of an invalidation, any tax (other than a tax that is
ordered refunded by the court or is otherwise refunded by the city) paid by a
person with respect to a service and calculated pursuant to this subchapter

TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX
§ 35.115 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known as the “City of San Gabriel Transactions and
Use Tax Ordinance of 2020.” The City of San Gabriel hereinafter shall be called
“city.” This subchapter shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of
the city.
(Ord. 667, passed 3-3-20)
§ 35.116 OPERATIVE DATE.
   OPERATIVE DATE means the first day of the first calendar quarter commencing
more than 110 days after the adoption of this subchapter, the date of such
adoption being as set forth below. The transactions and use tax established and
codified hereunder shall have an indefinite term. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the transactions and use tax established hereunder may be
later terminated by the voters of the City of San Gabriel by means of a ballot
measure to repeal the same at a future general or special municipal election of
the city.
(Ord. 667, passed 3-3-20)
§ 35.117 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes,
and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish
those purposes:
   (A)   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with § 7251) of Division 2 and § 7285.9 of
Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code, authorizing the city to
adopt this subchapter, which shall be operative if a majority of the electors
voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election
called for that purpose;
   (B)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal.
Rev. & Tax. Code;
   (C)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by
the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts
itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation
from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and
collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal. Rev. &
Tax. Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and
at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to
taxation under the provisions of this subchapter;
   (E)   The revenues generated by the transactions and use tax imposed under
this subchapter may be used for any lawful governmental purpose of the city, as
authorized by ordinance, resolution or action of the City Council or by
ordinance adopted by the electorate of the city. The transactions and use tax
established under this subchapter does not meet the criteria established by
California Constitution Article IIIC, Section 1(d) for special taxes and said
tax is instead a general tax within the meaning of California Constitution
Article IIIC, Section 1(a) whose revenues may be used for any unrestricted
general revenue purpose;
   (F)   Transactions and use tax revenues collected by the city shall be
deposited in the city’s general fund which is subject to the city’s annual
financial audit conducted by the city’s third-party auditor.
(Ord. 667, passed 3-3-20)
§ 35.118 CONTRACT WITH STATE.
   Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration to perform all functions incident to
the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance;

Department of Tax and Fee Administration prior to the operative date, it shall
nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the
first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a
contract.

(Ord. 667, passed 3-3-20)
§ 35.120 PLACE OF SALE.

to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross
receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are
subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which
the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the California Department of Tax
and Fee Administration.
(Ord. 667, passed 3-3-20)
§ 35.121 USE TAX RATE. 
   An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in

   (A)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 939 of 1989, the California
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 40000,
et seq., as amended, supplemented, superseded, and replaced from time to time),
requires cities and counties to reduce, reuse, and recycle (including
composting) solid waste generated in their jurisdictions to the maximum extent
feasible before any incineration or landfill disposal of waste, to conserve
water, energy, and other natural resources, and to protect the environment.
   (B)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 341 of 2011 (approved by the
Governor of the State of California on October 5, 2011, which amended Cal.
Public Resources Code §§ 41730, 41731, 41734, 41735, 41736, 41800, 42926,
44004, and 50001 of, and added §§ 40004, 41734.5, and 41780.01 and Chapter 12.8
(commencing with § 42649) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, and added and repealed
Cal. Public Resources Code § 41780.02, as amended, supplemented, superseded and
replaced from time to time), places requirements on businesses and multi-family
property owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid waste to
arrange for recycling services and requires jurisdictions to implement a
mandatory commercial recycling program.
   (C)   State organics recycling law, Assembly Bill 1826 of 2014 (approved by
the Governor of the State of California on September 28, 2014, which added Cal.

owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid waste, recycling,
and organic waste per week to arrange for recycling services for that waste,
requires jurisdictions to implement a recycling program to divert organic waste
from businesses subject to the law, and requires jurisdictions to implement a
mandatory commercial organics recycling program.
   (D)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires CalRecycle to develop regulations to reduce organics in landfills as a
source of methane. The regulations place requirements on multiple entities
including jurisdictions, residential households, commercial businesses and
business owners, commercial edible food generators, haulers, self-haulers, food
recovery organizations, and food recovery services to support achievement of
statewide organic waste disposal reduction targets.
   (E)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires jurisdictions to adopt and enforce an ordinance or enforceable
mechanism to implement relevant provisions of SB 1383 regulations. This
subchapter will also help reduce food insecurity by requiring commercial edible
food generators to arrange to have the maximum amount of their edible food,
that would otherwise be disposed, be recovered for human consumption.

The city's procedures on imposition of administrative fines are hereby
incorporated in their entirety, as modified from time to time, and shall govern
the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review of administrative citations
issued to enforce this subchapter and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant
to this subchapter, except as otherwise indicated in this subchapter.
   (B)   Other remedies allowed by law may be used, including civil action or
prosecution as misdemeanor or infraction. The city may pursue civil actions in
the California courts to seek recovery of unpaid administrative citations. The
city may choose to delay court action until such time as a sufficiently large
number of violations, or cumulative size of violations exist such that court
action is a reasonable use of city staff and resources.
   (C)   Responsible entity for enforcement.
      (1)   Enforcement pursuant to this subchapter may be undertaken by the
city's enforcement official, which may be the City Manager or their designated
entity, legal counsel, or combination thereof.

generator found to have prohibited container contaminants in a container. Such
notice will be provided via a cart tag or other communication immediately upon
identification of the prohibited container contaminants or within two days
after determining that a violation has occurred. If the city and/or their
designee observes prohibited container contaminants in a generator's containers
on more than three consecutive occasion(s), the city and/or their designee may
assess contamination processing fines or contamination penalties on the
generator on the third such occasion.
      (4)   With the exception of violations of generator contamination of
container contents addressed under §

available, to the owner at the address of the dwelling or commercial property
or to the party responsible for paying for the collection services, depending
upon available information.
      (6)   In addition to the foregoing, for incidences of prohibited
container contaminants found by a hauler in containers, hauler will issue a
notice of contamination to any generator found to have prohibited container
contaminants in a container. Such notice will be provided via a cart tag or
other communication immediately upon identification of the prohibited container
contaminants or within two days after determining that a violation has
occurred. If a hauler observes prohibited container contaminants in a
generator's containers on more than two occasion(s) every calendar year
starting January 1, the hauler shall have the right to assess a contamination
service charge on the generator to cover the additional costs of processing
contaminated containers per the current franchise hauler rate schedule. The
foregoing contamination service charge shall not be considered an
administrative fine or penalty. Any disputes arising from the assessment of a
contamination service charge shall be adjudicated pursuant to the customer
complaint resolution process provided under the terms of any contract,
agreement, or similar contractual authorization between the hauler and the city
to collect organic waste.
   (E)   Penalty amounts for types of violations. The penalty levels are as
follows:
      (1)   For a first violation, the amount of the base penalty shall not

   (G)   Compliance deadline extension considerations. The city may extend the
compliance deadlines set forth in a Notice of Violation issued in accordance
with this chapter, if it finds that there are extenuating circumstances beyond
the control of the respondent that make compliance within the deadlines
impracticable, including the following:
      (1)   Acts of God such as earthquakes, wildfires, flooding, and other
emergencies or natural disasters;
      (2)   Delays in obtaining discretionary permits or other government
agency approvals; or
      (3)   Deficiencies in organic waste recycling infrastructure or edible
food recovery capacity and the city is under a corrective action plan with
CalRecycle pursuant to 14 CCR § 18996.2 due to those deficiencies.
   (H)   Appeals process. Persons receiving an administrative citation
containing a penalty for an uncorrected violation may request a hearing to
appeal the citation. A hearing will be held only if it is requested within the
time prescribed and consistent with the city's procedures in the city's codes
for appeals of administrative citations. Evidence may be presented at the
hearing. The city will appoint a hearing officer who shall conduct the hearing
and issue a final written order.
   (I)   Education period for non-compliance. Beginning January 1, 2022 and
through December 31, 2023, the city will conduct inspections, remote
monitoring, route reviews or waste evaluations, and compliance reviews,
depending upon the type of regulated entity, to determine compliance, and if
the city determines that organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, tier one
commercial edible food generator, food recovery organization, food recovery
service, or other entity is not in compliance, it shall provide educational
materials to the entity describing its obligations under this subchapter and a
notice that compliance is required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may
be subject to administrative civil penalties starting on January 1, 2024.
   (J)   Civil penalties for non-compliance. Beginning January 1, 2024, if the
city determines that an organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, tier one
or tier two commercial edible food generator, food recovery organization, food

approved, in that portion extending from the property line to the upper
terminus thereof by a standing test which shall consist of filling the line
with water and carrying the level of the column of such water to a height
sufficient to develop a pressure of four pounds per square inch at the lower
terminus thereof, and in no event to a height of less than four inches above
the top of the upper terminal end of such sewer. In lieu of such standing test,
a pump test may be made which shall consist of filling the line with water,
capping or sealing each upper terminus thereof, and applying an air pump at the
property line in such a manner as to furnish an aggregate pressure of four
pounds per square inch in such sewer at such lower terminus.
         (b)   Where, by reason of excessive fall in any such house connection
sewer, the static pressure in a standing test will exceed four pounds per
square inch, such line shall be tested in sections of such length that no such
section, nor any portion thereof, will be subjected to a pressure greater than
four pounds per square inch.

require additional FOG pretreatment.
(Ord. 605-C.S., passed 10-1-13)
§ 51.63 FOG PRETREATMENT REQUIRED.
   (A)   Application of requirements. The requirements of this section shall
apply to:
      (1)   All new food service establishments including, but not limited to,
restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, caterers, manufacturing plants and any other dischargers who
introduce FOG into the sanitary sewer;
      (2)   Any existing food service establishment upon the sale or transfer
of operational control thereof;
      (3)   Any existing food service establishment upon renovation of the
plumbing system or addition of any equipment that may increase discharge of FOG
to the sewer system, regardless of valuation; or any material renovation of the
establishment with a building permit valuation of $50,000 or more; and
      (4)   Any existing food service establishment, which has caused or
contributed to a grease-related blockage in the sanitary sewer, or which, based
on inspection or sampling, has been determined by the Director to be
discharging FOG in significant quantities sufficient to adversely impact the
sanitary sewer.
   (B)   Grease interceptor requirement. All food service establishments
specified in division (A) of this section shall install, operate and maintain
an approved type, adequately sized and readily accessible grease interceptor
necessary to maintain compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Grease
interceptor sizing and installation shall meet the minimum standards of the
most recent edition of the California Plumbing Code. Grease interceptors shall
have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention
and shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the San Gabriel
Municipal Code, subject to the review and approval of the Director and the
Building Official.
   (C)   Variance of grease interceptor requirement. A food service
establishment may obtain a variance from the grease interceptor requirement, if
a request is submitted in writing to the Director, to allow the installation
and maintenance of an alternative pretreatment device in lieu of a grease
interceptor provided that such alternative pretreatment device is equally as
effective in controlling the FOG discharge. Alternative pretreatment devices,
including, but not limited to, grease traps and other separation and holding
devices, must be appropriately sized and approved by the Director and the
Building Official. The food service establishment must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Director that the grease interceptor installation and
operation is physically not feasible or not warranted to fulfill discharge
requirements at the site and that the alternative pretreatment device is
equivalent to a grease interceptor in controlling the food service
establishment’s FOG discharge.
   (D)   Conditional waiver of interceptor requirement. An existing food
service establishment may obtain a conditional waiver from installing a grease
interceptor if the food service establishment can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Director that it has a negligible FOG discharge and an
insignificant impact on the sewer system. Any waiver granted by the Director
shall be voided by the food service establishment making changes in its
operations that significantly affect FOG discharge, including, but not limited
to, changes in food preparation activities, renovations of the plumbing system,
and increased discharges to the sewer system. The waiver shall remain valid
until the expiration date specified in the waiver, provided that the food
service establishment remains in compliance with the waiver’s terms and
conditions. A waiver may be revoked at any time when any of the terms and
conditions for its issuance is not satisfied or if the justification for the
waiver no longer exists.
   (E)   Sanitary fixtures. Toilets, urinals, and other similar sanitary
fixtures shall not discharge through the grease interceptor unless specifically
approved, in writing, by the Director.
(Ord. 605-C.S., passed 10-1-13)
§ 51.64 REQUIRED MAINTENANCE OF PRETREATMENT DEVICES.
   (A)   All pretreatment devices shall be maintained in efficient operating
condition at all times by periodic removal of the full contents of such
devices, which includes wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge
and solids. The maintenance frequency shall be adequate to comply with the
design capacity of the pretreatment device. In maintaining the pretreatment
device, the owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal, by
appropriate means, of the captured material and shall maintain records of the
dates, amounts and means of disposal, all of which is subject to review by the
Director.
   (B)   Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned at a
frequency such that the combined FOG and solids accumulation does not exceed
25% of the total hydraulic capacity of the grease interceptor calculated by
volume or depth, whichever is more stringent. At the minimum, all grease
interceptors shall be maintained not less than once every six months. Grease
interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned quarterly when the
maintenance frequency has not been established. The Director may change the
maintenance frequency at any time to reflect changes in actual operating
conditions in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. If the grease
interceptor, at any time, contains FOG and solids accumulation that does not
meet the requirements of this chapter, the food service establishment shall be
required to have the grease interceptor serviced immediately such that all
fats, oils, grease, sludge, and other materials are completely removed from the
grease interceptor.
   (C)   Additives that reduce FOG, such as bacteria, may be used in addition
to the regular maintenance program for grease interceptors, but shall not
impinge on grease interceptor sizing or maintenance frequency. The use of
additives is subject to approval by the Director. The introduction of
emulsifying agents, such as chemicals or solvents, either directly or
indirectly into the grease interceptor, other than what is considered typical
business operational practices such as dishwashing or sanitation, is strictly
prohibited.
   (D)   Wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge solids, and
other waste materials removed from the grease interceptor shall be properly
disposed off site by waste haulers in accordance with federal, state and local
laws. All pumping of grease pretreatment facilities and tallow bin hauling by
private contractors must be tracked by a manifest to confirm the pumping and
hauling of waste. Food service establishments are required to obtain and
maintain a copy of the waste hauler’s documentation which must include:
      (1)   The name and address of the hauling company;
      (2)   The name and signature of operator performing the pump out;
      (3)   Documentation of full pump out with volume of water and FOG removed
(e.g., 1,500 gallons);
      (4)   Documentation of the level of floating FOG and settable solids;
      (5)   Documentation of any repairs to the grease interceptor; and
      (6)   Identification of the facility where the waste hauler is planning
to dispose of the waste.
(Ord. 605-C.S., passed 10-1-13)
§ 51.65 RECORD MAINTENANCE REQUIRED.
   Every food service establishment shall maintain a compliance record of all
manifests, receipts and invoices of all cleaning, maintenance, grease removal
from pretreatment devices, hauling and disposal of waste, and cleaning of

CONNECTIONS
§ 52.10 CONNECTIONS REQUIRED PRIOR TO STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   Whenever a contract is let for the construction of a public sewer in any
street, or whenever the Council adopts a resolution or ordinance of intention
to improve any street in which there is a public sewer, water main, or gas
main, or in which a water main or gas main is to be laid, the Council may, by
motion, direct the Community Development Director to immediately give notice to
all owners of real property fronting on the portions of such streets intended
to be improved to connect their premises with a lateral sewer connection, water
main, or gas main on such street, either before the improvement is made or as a
part thereof, where such premises are not so connected at the time of giving
the notice.
('65 Code, § 6-8.202) (Ord. 201, passed - - )
§ 52.11 NOTICE THAT COMPLIANCE IS REQUIRED.
   The notice referred to in §
52.10 shall state the fact of the passage of the resolution or ordinance of
intention and shall state that unless such premises shall be connected with the
sewer, water main, or gas main in the manner provided in this chapter, the
Community Development Director will connect such premises at the expense of the
property owner as provided in this chapter.
('65 Code, § 6-8.203) (Ord. 201, passed - - )
§ 52.12 PUBLICATION OF NOTICE; SERVICE TO PROPERTY OWNER AND UTILITIES.
   (A)   Service to property owner. The Community Development Director shall
cause such notice to be published in two successive issues in the newspaper
published and circulated in the city in which the official advertising of the
city is published and, where the premises abutting upon the streets affected
are occupied, shall serve, or cause to be served, upon the occupants thereof a
copy of the notice. Where such premises are not occupied, a copy of the notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon each parcel of property fronting on
the streets affected. The service of the notice upon such occupants of the
property affected, and the posting thereon, shall be completed before the
expiration of the time of publication in the official newspaper. The affidavit
of publication in the official newspaper and the affidavit of the Director or
of the person posting and serving the notices shall be filed in the office of
the Community Development Director and shall be prima facie evidence of due and
proper publication and service of the notice. Personal service of the notice
upon the owner of any property affected shall dispense with the necessity of
further notices to him. ('65 Code, § 6-8.204)
   (B)   Service to utility. The Community Development Director, at the time of
serving the notices required, shall also cause to be served upon the person,

8.205)
(Ord. 201, passed - - )
§ 52.13 IMPROVEMENTS NOT ORDERED.
   In the event the improvements specified in the resolution or ordinance of
intention are not ordered at the time of the service of the notice, the notice
shall be inoperative, but the provisions of this section shall not prevent the
Community Development Director from thereafter giving the notice at any time
subsequent to the adoption of the resolution or ordinance directing the
improvement.
('65 Code, § 6-8.206) (Ord. 201, passed - - )
§ 52.14 PROTESTS; FILING AND HEARING, DECISION.
   (A)   Filing and hearing. Within ten days of the date of the last
publication of the notice, the owner of any real property affected thereby may
file with the City Clerk a written protest against being required to make the
connection required of him by such notice. At the regular meeting of the
Council next succeeding the date of the expiration of the time within which
such protests may be filed, or at any time to which the matter may be
continued, the Council shall hear the protests. ('65 Code, § 6-8.207)
   (B)   Decision. The Council, at the time of such hearing, or at any regular
meeting held thereafter to which such hearing is continued, may sustain or
overrule such protests, may order that connections be made at different
intervals than as specified in this chapter, may order that connections be made
of a different size than as specified in this chapter, and may fix times other
than those specified within which such connections shall be commenced and
completed by the owners of abutting property. The determination of the Council
shall be evidenced by motion if no protests are filed. The Council may, at the
first meeting after the expiration of the time within which protests may be
filed, or at a subsequent meeting to which the matter may be regularly
continued, make a determination regarding the matters set forth in this section
in the same manner and to the same effect as if made after protest. In either
case such determination shall be final and conclusive. A copy of the motion by
which the determination is evidenced shall be posted for two days in a
conspicuous place on or near the office of the City Clerk. The Council may
thereafter, by motion, extend the time for commencing and completing such
connections. ('65 Code, § 6-8.208)
(Ord. 201, passed - - )
§ 52.15 TIME OF COMMENCEMENT BY OWNER.
   Within ten days after the expiration of the time for filing protests or, if

fixed by the Council, it shall be the duty of each owner of real property
fronting on a street affected by proceedings taken pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter to commence in good faith the work of making the connections
required and to diligently prosecute such work to completion.
('65 Code, § 6-8.209) (Ord. 201, passed - - )
§ 52.16 FAILURE OF OWNER TO PERFORM WORK.
   At the expiration of ten days the Community Development Director shall make,

upon its own motion, permit fewer connections than specified in this division
in the case of any lot which the Council may deem adequately provided with gas
laterals.
   (B)   Water.
      (1)   Lateral connections with water mains shall be made to the property

      (2)   Lateral water connections shall be installed from the water main to
each lot. Where a lot has more than 50 feet of street frontage upon the street
to be improved, one lateral water connection shall be installed for each 50
feet, or fraction thereof, of street frontage; provided, however, upon petition
of any property owner or upon its own motion, the Council may permit fewer
connections than specified in this division in the case of any lot which the
Council may deem adequately provided with water laterals.
('65 Code, § 6-8.211) (Ord. 201, passed - - )
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 52.18 LIENS.
   (A)   Records. The Community Development Director shall provide a suitable
record book entitled Liens for Lateral Service Connections. Such book shall
have appropriate headings wherein may be entered the name of each street in
which lateral connections shall be made pursuant to the provisions of this
subchapter. Under such headings, columns shall be provided in which may be
entered the name of the owner of the property with which connections are made,
if known, a description of such property, the connections made, the date of
completion of the connections, the expenses incurred by the city in making each
such connection, the date of delinquency, the penalty for delinquency, the
total amount chargeable against the property at the date of sale, the date of
sale, the name of the purchaser, the date of redemption, by whom redeemed, the
amount paid to redeem, and the date of the deed to the city. When lateral
connections are made, the Community Development Director shall enter in such
book under the name of the street where such work was done, the name of each
owner of real property with which connections were made, if known, and, if not
known, the words “unknown owner,” a brief description of the property
connected, the connections made, the date of each such connection, and the
expenses incurred by the city in making or causing to be made each such
connection. No error in the name of the property owner, and no error in the
description of the property, shall affect the validity of the lien provided for
in this section provided the description is such that the property referred to
may be identified therefrom. ('65 Code, § 6-8.212)
   (B)   Publication. When the entries in such book have been made by the
Community Development Director, he shall cause to be published notice thereof
for three successive issues in the newspaper published and circulated in the
city in which the official advertising of the city is published. ('65 Code, §
6-8.213)
   (C)   Protests. Any property owner affected by proceedings taken pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter and feeling aggrieved by any act or
determination of the Community Development Director or the Council in relation
thereto, or who may claim that the connections, or any thereof, have not been
made in a safe and workmanlike manner, or having any objection to the
correctness or legality of the entries in the record book of the Community
Development Director may, within 30 days of the date of the first publication
of the notice provided for in division (B) of this section, file with the City
Clerk an objection in writing which shall briefly specify the ground of his
objection or protest. All such objections and protests shall be heard at the
regular meeting of the Council next succeeding the expiration of the time for
filing the same, or the Council may at such meeting fix a time and place
therefor. Upon such objection or protest, the Council may remedy or correct any
error or informality in the proceedings, revise and correct any of the acts or
determinations of the Community Development Director relative to such work,
confirm, amend, set aside, alter, modify, or correct the charges entered in the
book in such manner as to it shall seem just, require such work to be completed
according to the directions of the Council, and may instruct and direct the
Community Development Director to correct the entries in the book to conform to
the decision of the Council in relation thereto. The decisions and
determinations of the Council in such matters shall be final and conclusive
upon all persons entitled to object or protest pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter. ('65 Code, § 6-8.214)
   (D)   Foreclosure. Subject to the powers of the Council to correct and
modify, as provided in division (C) of this section, the amount of the charges
entered against each parcel of property shall become a lien against such
property in such amount as of the date of entry in the book entitled Liens for
Lateral Service Connections and shall thereupon become due and payable. No such
lien shall be extinguished until the amount thereof is paid in full or until a
valid deed of the property subject thereto is given by the Community
Development Director. Commencing the first week of January and July of each
year, the Community Development Director shall cause to be published for five
successive issues in the newspaper published and circulated in the city in
which the official advertising of the city is published a list of all liens
remaining due and unpaid on the first day of the month in which such
publication is commenced. The list shall contain the name of each owner of each
parcel of property upon which there is due an assessment or, if the name of
such owner does not appear in the book, the fact that the lien is entered
against an unknown owner, a description of the property, the total amount
necessary to satisfy the lien if paid in full before noon on the first Monday
of the month next succeeding the month in which the list is published, that 10%
of the amount of each such lien shall be added thereto for delinquency, and
that upon the first Tuesday of the month next succeeding the month in which the
lien is published, each parcel of property against which a lien remains unpaid
will, at 10:00 a.m. at the office of the Community Development Director in the
city hall, by operation of law and the declarations of the Community
Development Director, be sold to the city for the amount of such lien and
delinquency penalty. The Community Development Director shall enter in the
record book the date of each of such sales, the amount for which sold, and that
the same was sold to the city. ('65 Code, § 6-8.215)
   (E)   Redemption of property. A redemption of any parcel of property sold
for delinquent assessment pursuant to the proceedings set forth in this chapter
may be made at any time within one year from the date of sale by paying to the
Community Development Director the amount for which the property is sold, and,
in addition thereto, 10% thereof, if paid within three months from the date of
sale; 20% percent if paid within six months; 30% if paid within nine months;
and 40% if paid within 12 months. When redemption is made, the Community
Development Director shall note that fact in the book entitled Liens for
Lateral Service Connections in an appropriate column, entering thereon the date
of redemption, the person by whom redeemed, and the amount paid. At the
expiration of 12 months from the date of sale, the Community Development
Director shall execute to the city a deed of the property sold, the name of the
owner thereof as it appears on such book, a statement that such property was
sold for a delinquent lien for making lateral connections, the amount for which
the property was sold, and the date of the sale. The deed of the Community
Development Director shall convey absolute title to the property therein
described and be prima facie evidence of all matters therein recited and the
regularity of all proceedings prior to the execution thereof. ('65 Code, § 6-
8.216)

§ 52.20 VALIDITY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that
its purposes may be affected. No error or informality in any act or proceeding
taken which does not substantially affect the rights of property owners shall
invalidate the proceedings taken or liens established in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. Whenever such acts or proceedings are required to
be performed or done by the Community Development Director or by the Council,
such provisions respecting time shall be construed to be directory and not
mandatory.
('65 Code, § 6-8.218) (Ord. 201, passed - - )
§ 52.21 DEPOSITS AND FEES REQUIRED.
   The provisions of this code relating to deposits for excavations in streets
and other public places in the city shall apply with respect to all excavations
made by property owners pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. In the
event the property owners do not make the connections required and the
Community Development Director shall make the same, there shall be included in
the expense of making each such connection an amount, determined by Council
resolution, which shall be in lieu of the deposits and charges provided to be
made for excavations. Nothing contained in this chapter shall affect the
provisions of this code respecting the inspection of sewer and other
connections and the payment of fees therefor. The fees provided by this code
shall be paid as in other cases and shall be considered when connections are
made by the city as a part of the expense of making such connections.

§ 54.07 INFORMATION REQUIRED BEFORE ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   (A)   In accordance with §
54.08, the city's franchised waste hauler must handle all construction and
demolition material generated on a project site. Use of the franchised hauler
shall waive the requirement for a "Waste Management and Recycling Plan."
   (B)   If an applicant chooses to use the services of an independent
recycling company, in accordance with §
54.08, then the applicant shall submit a properly completed "Waste Management
and Recycling Plan," on a form prescribed by the city, as a part of the
building, demolition, or grading permit application process.
   (C)   The Waste Management and Recycling Plan shall indicate the following:
      (1)   Applicant contact information;
      (2)   A description of the project which includes location, square
footage, estimated timeline for completion of the project, and any other

§ 54.08 ON SITE PRACTICES.
   (A)   Use of franchise waste hauler required.
      (1)   The city's franchised waste hauler must handle all construction and
demolition material generated on a project site. The applicant, or the
applicant's subcontractors, may not self-haul material to a disposal or
diversion facility. An applicant may, however, acquire the services of an
independent recycling company, so long as the recycling company does not charge
a fee for bins nor bin service.
      (2)   The city's franchised waste hauler shall be required to divert from
landfill at least 50% of the material received from a job site. If the
franchised waste hauler guarantees 50% diversion, use of that franchise waste
hauling service shall be deemed as complying with the 50% diversion requirement
and any receipt issued by the waste hauler to the applicant shall constitute
evidence of such diversion.
   (B)   Alternative hauler authorization. If the city's franchised waste
hauler is unable to meet the 50% diversion requirement, the applicant must
contact the Building Official immediately, and the Building Official can
consider authorizing the use of alternative waste hauler(s) or recycler(s) that
can meet the 50% diversion requirement.
   (C)   Record keeping. During the term of the demolition or construction
project, the applicant shall keep all invoices from the franchised hauler or a
record of all materials diverted and disposed in tonnage or in other
measurements that can be converted to tonnage.
   (D)   Evaluation of recycling, disposal and salvage. The Building Official,
or authorized designee, may monitor and evaluate all or selected projects to
gauge the percentage of materials recycled, salvaged and disposed. Diversion
will be measured separately with respect to the demolition segment and the
construction segment of a project where both demolition and construction are
involved.
   (E)   Separation standards. To the maximum extent feasible as determined by
the City Engineer, Building Inspector or designee on-site separation of scrap
wood and clean green waste in a designated debris box or boxes shall be
arranged in order to permit chipping and mulching for soil enhancement or land
cover purposes. In order to protect chipping and grinding machinery, metal and
other materials, which cannot be chipped or ground, shall not be placed in such
boxes.
   (F)   W allboard. On-site separation shall be undertaken for wallboard to
the extent feasible on new construction.
(Ord. 557-C.S., passed 12-6-05)
§ 54.09 DECONSTRUCTION AND SALVAGE AND RECOVERY.
   Contractors are encouraged to make every structure planned for demolition
available for deconstruction, salvage and recovery prior to demolition and to
recover the maximum feasible amount of salvageable recyclable and reusable
materials prior to demolition. Recovered and salvaged recyclable and reusable
materials from the deconstruction phase shall be counted towards the diversion
requirements of this chapter, provided it is accounted for in the Waste
Management and Recycling Plan.
(Ord. 557-C.S., passed 12-6-05)
§ 54.10 REPORTING.
   (A)   Within 60 days following the completion of the demolition phase of a
project, and again within 60 days following the completion of the construction
phase of a project, the applicant shall, as a condition precedent to final
inspection and to issuance of any certificate of occupancy or final approval of
project, submit documentation to the Building Official, or authorized designee,
that proves compliance with the requirements of §
54.03.
   (B)   The documentation shall consist of either receipts from the franchised
hauler, or a completed Recycling and Reuse Summary Report. The report shall
show actual data of tonnage or volume of materials recycled and diverted,
supported by originals or photocopies of receipts and weight tags or other
records of measurement from the hauling/recycling vendor(s) used. Receipts and
weight tags will be used to verify whether materials generated from the site
have been or are to be recycled, reused, salvaged or otherwise disposed.
   (C)   The applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all
construction and demolition waste are weighed in compliance with all regulatory
requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition
waste for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other
considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of
volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized
conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose.
   (D)   If a project involves both demolition and construction, the report and
documentation for the demolition project must be submitted and approved by the
Building Official, or authorized designee, before issuance of a building permit
for the construction phase of the project.
   (E)   Any deposit posted pursuant to §
54.04 shall be forfeited if the applicant does not meet the timely reporting
requirements of this section.

§ 54.11 DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE AND RELEASE OF DIVERSION SECURITY DEPOSIT.
   The Building Official shall review the information submitted under §
54.10 and determine whether the applicant has complied with the requirements of
this chapter as follows:

applicant has fully complied with the requirements of this chapter, the
Building Official shall authorize that the full Diversion Security Deposit,
less the administrative fee, if applicable, be released to the applicant.
   (B)   Noncompliance; but good faith effort. If the Building Official finds
that less than 50% of the project waste was diverted from disposal at a
landfill, the Building Official shall determine whether the applicant made a
good faith effort to comply with this chapter. When making this determination
the Building Official shall consider the availability of markets for the C&D
materials transported for disposal in a landfill, the size of the project, and
the documented efforts of the applicant to divert C&D materials. If the
Building Official determines that the applicant has made a good faith effort to
comply with this chapter, the Building Official shall approve the release of
the diversion security deposit, or a portion thereof, to the applicant. Any
portion of the diversion security deposit not released to the applicant shall
be forfeited to the city and shall be used for the purposes of promoting
recycling within the city.
   (C)   Noncompliance. If the Building Official finds that less than 50% of
the project waste was diverted from disposal at a landfill, and if the Building
Official determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to
comply with this chapter, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation
required by §
54.10 within the required time period, then the diversion security deposit
shall be retained by the city.
   (D)   Refund. The Building Official shall authorize the refund of any
diversion security deposit if the building, demolition, or grading permit
application is withdrawn or cancelled before any work has begun.
   (E)   All diversion security deposits retained by the city shall be used
only for:
      (1)   Payment of diversion security deposit refunds;
      (2)   Costs of administration of the program established by this chapter;
and
      (3)   Costs of programs to achieve diversion of C&D materials required by
this chapter.

appealable by the same methods and subject to the same fees as other provisions
of the city's development codes.
(Ord. 557-C.S., passed 12-6-05)
§ 54.99    PENALTY.
   Each violation of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a
misdemeanor and shall be punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not

operators regarding standards for service, hours of operations, etc. to ensure

PRIVATE BUSES
§ 71.80 INTENT.
   Operators of private buses have from time to time been observed parking in a
manner that obstructs access to and from businesses, occupying multiple on-
street parking spaces or public transit bus zones, impairing sight distance for
other motorists and pedestrians, and idling engines for significant periods of
time. The operation of private buses in this manner creates unnecessary traffic
congestion, increases the likelihood of safety hazards, and raises the noise
and air pollution levels in the community. The city desires to regulate the
parking of these private buses in order to promote the health, safety and
welfare of its residents and visitors by prohibiting stopping, standing,
loading or unloading of private buses from all public streets in the city.
(Ord. 610-C.S., passed 4-1-14)

      (2)   Transporting passengers to and from specific cultural, educational,
or entertainment events at public facilities or parks within the city.
   (C)   The regulations imposed by this section shall not be effective until
such time as signs giving notice of such restrictions are conspicuously posted
on streets at the entrances to the city.
   (D)   Private bus operators violating this section shall be subject to a
fine as set forth in the City of San Gabriel Parking Penalty Schedule as
adopted by the City Council, and amended from time to time by resolution.

street parking lots or places which are obviously limited to use by customers,
clients, patients or patrons of the owner or other person in lawful possession
thereof, and that such persons so parking having no intention of making a
purchase or sale at the place of business, being or becoming a patient or
client at the office, or having any useful or other contact with such owner or
other person in lawful possession providing such limited off-street private
parking facility, and thereby use up the space reserved for or limited to the
use of customers, clients, patients or patrons of the owner or other person in
lawful possession of such facility to his loss or other disadvantage.

§ 90.01 FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.
   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the
authority granted by the state pursuant to the provisions of Cal. Veh. Code §
22660 to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or
parts thereof, as public nuisances, the Council hereby makes the following
findings and declarations:
      The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property, is
hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private
property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create
fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and
to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the
presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, or part
thereof, on private or public property, except as expressly permitted by the
provisions of this chapter, is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance
which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 90.10 HEARINGS; DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   All hearings held pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be
held before the City Manager or one or more of his deputies, designated by him
as Hearing Officer, who shall hear all facts and testimony deemed pertinent.
Such facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle,

property or public property. The Hearing Officer shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land on which the vehicle is
located may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written
statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land,
with his reasons for such denial.
   (B)   The Hearing Officer may impose such conditions and take such other
action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
purposes of this chapter. He may delay the time for the removal of the vehicle,
or part thereof, if, in his opinion, the circumstances so justify. At the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Hearing Officer may find that a vehicle,
or part thereof, has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or is inoperative on
private or public property, order the same removed from the property as a
public nuisance and disposed of as provided in this chapter, and determine the
administrative costs and the costs of removal to be charged against the owner
of the parcel of land on which the vehicle, or part thereof, is located. The
order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle, or part
thereof, and the correct identification number and license number of the
vehicle, if available at the site.
   (C)   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the

acquiesced in its presence, the Hearing Officer shall not assess costs of
administration for removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the
vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such
landowner.
   (D)   If an interested person makes a written presentation to the Hearing
Officer but does not appear, such interested person shall be notified in
writing of the decision.

§ 110.12 EXEMPT LICENSES.
   (A)   Business exempt by state or federal laws. The provisions of this
chapter shall not be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting and
carrying on any business exempt, by virtue of the Constitution or applicable
statutes of the United States or of the state, from the payment of such fees as
are set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Interstate commerce.
      (1)   Applications. None of the license fees provided for by this chapter
shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In
any case where a license fee is believed a licensee, or an applicant for a
license, to place an undue burden upon such commerce, he may apply to the
Finance Director for an adjustment of the fee so that it shall not be
discriminatory or unreasonable as to such commerce. The application may be made
before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license fee.
The applicant, by affidavit and supporting testimony, shall show his method of
business and the gross volume, or estimated gross volume, of business; an
estimate of, or its actual allocation as between interstate and intrastate
business; and such other information as the Finance Director may deem necessary
in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on such
commerce.
      (2)   Amount of fee. The Finance Director shall then cause an
investigation to be made and, after having obtained the written opinion of the
City Attorney, shall fix as the license fee for the applicant an amount which
is reasonable and nondiscriminatory or, if the license fee has already been
paid shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license fee so
fixed. In fixing the license fee to be charged, the Finance Director shall have
the power to base the license fee upon a percentage of gross receipts, or any
measure which will assure that the license fee assessed shall be uniform with
that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does
not exceed the license fee set forth in this chapter. Should the Finance
Director determine the gross receipts measure of the license fee to be the
proper basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of the
termination of the applicant's business in the city or at the end of each three
month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of
license fee therefor; provided, however, no additional license fee during any
one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an
amount equal to the annual license fee set forth in this chapter.
   (C)   Charitable and nonprofit activities. The provisions of this title
shall not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a license tax to
conduct, manage or carry on any business, occupation, event or activity from
any institution or organization which is conducted, managed or carried on for
the benefit of charitable, philanthropic, educational or religious purposes
provided convincing evidence is furnished to the Finance Director which
establishes that not less than 75% of the gross receipts derived from such
business, occupation, event or activity will be devoted to charitable,
philanthropic, educational or religious purposes. The provisions of this
section shall not be deemed to exempt any such institution or organization from
complying with any other provisions of this code requiring a permit from the
city.
   (D)   Verified statements; filing. Any person claiming an exemption pursuant
to the provisions of this section shall file a verified statement with the
Finance Director stating the facts upon which such exemption is claimed.
   (E)   Issuance of exempt licenses. The Finance Director shall, upon a proper
showing contained in the verified statement, issue a license to such person
claiming an exemption pursuant to the provisions of this section without
payment to the city of the license fee set forth in this chapter.
   (F)   Revocation of exempt licenses. The Finance Director, after giving
notice and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing to the licensee, may revoke
any license granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon information
that the licensee is not entitled to the exemption provided for in this
section.
('65 Code, § 3-1.111) (Ord. 810, passed - - ; Am. Ord. 107-C.S., passed - - )
§ 110.13 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION; GROUNDS.
   Any license or permit granted or issued pursuant to the provisions of this
code may be suspended or revoked at any time:
   (A)   For a material false statement contained in the application;
   (B)   For failure to comply with any regulatory provisions contained in the
statutes of the state or the laws of the city regulating such business;
   (C)   For failure to operate such business in an orderly and businesslike
manner in compliance with such orders, rules and regulations as may be
applicable thereto pursuant to the provisions of this code or statutes of the
state; or

without first obtaining a license to conduct such business shall not relieve
the person from paying the license fee due and unpaid at the time of such

prosecution for the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. All
remedies prescribed in this chapter shall be cumulative, and the use of any one

relief from such invalidity or preemption, including the payment of liquidated
damages. If the grantee and grantor are unable to reach agreement on such
modifications, the dispute will be submitted to a mutually agreeable
arbitrator, in accordance with state laws, who will determine what

decision shall be binding on the parties; provided, however, no decision of the
arbitrator shall require the grantor or grantee to be in violation of any
federal or state law or regulation.

GRANTING OF FRANCHISE
§ 112.020 GRANTING.
   (A)   In the event the grantor shall grant to the grantee a nonexclusive,
revocable franchise to construct, operate, maintain and reconstruct a cable
communications system within the franchise area, such franchise shall
constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable
communications system as required by the provisions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement. The franchise agreement shall include those provisions of
the grantee's application for the franchise which are finally negotiated and
accepted by the grantor and grantee.
   (B)   The franchise shall be granted under the terms and conditions of this
chapter, consistent with state law, which are incorporated by this reference as
if fully set forth herein. In the event of conflict between the terms and
conditions of the franchise and the terms and conditions on which the grantor
can grant a franchise, the statutory requirements, without exception, shall
control.
   (C)   The franchise shall be made subject to the general ordinance
provisions now in effect or hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise
shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and laws of the
grantor regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction.
('65 Code, § 7-8.401) (Ord. 244-C.S., passed - - )
§ 112.021 FRANCHISE TERRITORY.

public streets and ways within the franchise territory such wires, cables,
conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary and
appurtenant to the operation of the cable communications system. Prior to any
construction or alteration, however, the grantee in each case shall file plans
with the appropriate grantor agencies and local utility companies and receive
written approval before proceeding.

acceptance of the franchise, in which event the franchise shall be null and
void.

right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable
communications system as the grantor deems appropriate.
('65 Code, § 7-8.405) (Ord. 244-C.S., passed - - )
§ 112.025 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   Transfer of franchises. Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter
shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public. Such franchise
shall not in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of,
including, but not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, merger,
consolidation, receivership or other means, without the prior consent of the
grantor, and then only under such conditions as the grantor may establish. Such
consent as required by the grantor, however, shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
   (B)   Ownership or control. The grantee shall promptly notify the grantor of
any actual or proposed change in, transfer of or acquisition by any other party
of the control of the grantee. The word CONTROL, as used in this division,
shall not be limited to major stockholders but shall include actual working
control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer
of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any
person or group of persons of 10% of the voting shares of the grantee. Every
change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the
franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the grantor shall have
consented thereto which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the
purpose of determining whether the grantor shall consent to such change,
transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall
assist the grantor in any such inquiry.
   (C)   Foreclosures. The grantor agrees that any financial institution having
a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the
construction and/or operation of the franchise, prior to enforcing any right to
foreclose, shall have the right to notify the grantor that the financial
institution or its designee satisfactory to the grantor will take control and
operate the cable television system. Further, such financial institution shall
also submit a plan for such operation which will insure continued service and
compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall
not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless
extended by the grantor in its discretion, and during such period of time the
financial institution shall have the right to petition the grantor to transfer
the franchise to another grantee. If the grantor finds that such transfer,
after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public
interest qualities of the applicant, is satisfactory, the grantor will transfer
and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public
interest. The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
   (D)   Preferences for local organizations. The grantor reserves the right,
all other things being equal, in the event of a request for the approval of the
transfer of the ownership of the franchise by the grantee, other than pursuant
to division (C) of this section, to grant preference to any local not-for-
profit organization demonstrating a willingness and capability to meet the
terms and amount of the bona fide offer made to the grantee for the purchase of
the franchise and network. In no event, however, shall the grantor delay a
ruling on any request for the approval of the transfer of the ownership of the
franchise by the grantee for more than 30 days after the receipt of such
request by the grantor.
   (E)   Non-waivers of rights. The consent or approval of the grantor to any
transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights
of the grantor in and to the streets, and any transfer, by its terms, shall be
expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise.
   (F)   Substantial completion required. In the absence of extraordinary
circumstances, the grantor shall not approve any transfer or assignment of the
franchise prior to the substantial completion of the construction of the
proposed system.
   (G)   Obligations of successors in interest. In no event shall a transfer of
ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a
signatory to the franchise agreement.

§ 112.026 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Applications. The franchise may be renewed by the grantor upon an
application of the grantee pursuant to the procedures set forth in division (B)
of this section and in accordance with the then applicable laws.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   At least 13 months prior to the expiration of the franchise, the
grantee shall inform the grantor in writing of its intent to seek the renewal
of the franchise.
      (2)   After giving public notice, the grantor shall proceed to determine
whether the grantee has satisfactorily performed its obligations under the
franchise. To determine satisfactory performance, the grantor shall consider
the technical developments and performance of the system, the programming,
other services offered, the cost of services, and any other particular
requirements set forth in this chapter. Also, the grantor shall consider the
grantee's annual reports made to the grantor and the FCC. Industry performance
on a national basis shall also be considered. Provisions shall be made for
public comment.
      (3)   A four-month period shall be provided to determine the grantee's
eligibility for renewal.
      (4)   The grantor shall then prepare, within two months, any amendments
to this chapter the grantor believes necessary.
      (5)   If the grantor finds the grantee's performance satisfactory, a new
franchise may be granted pursuant to this chapter as amended for an additional
period of ten years. Subsequent renewal for ten-year periods may be applied for
by the grantee in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
      (6)   In the event the grantee is determined by the grantor to have
performed unsatisfactorily, new applicants may be sought and evaluated, and a
franchise award may be made by the grantor.
('65 Code, § 7-8.407) (Ord. 244-C.S., passed - - )
§ 112.027 POLICE POWERS.
   (A)   In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights
are subject to the police powers of the grantor to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and the grantee
agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the
grantor pursuant to such powers.
   (B)   Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the grantor's police powers shall be
resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of
general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to the grantee
or cable communications system which contains provisions inconsistent with the
franchise shall prevail only if, upon such exercise, the grantor finds an
emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general
welfare or such exercise is mandated by law.
('65 Code, § 7-8.408) (Ord. 244-C.S., passed - - )
§ 112.028 FRANCHISE FEES.
   (A)   Annual franchise payments. The grantee of a franchise shall pay to the
grantor an annual fee in an amount as designated in the franchise agreement,
but in no event less than 5% of the annual gross revenues. Such payment shall
be in addition to any other and commence as of the effective date of the
franchise. In the event of a dispute, the grantor, if it so requests, shall be
furnished a statement of such payment by a certified public accountant
reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues and the charges,
deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment.
   (B)   Acceptance by the grantor. No acceptance of any payment by the grantor
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee
pursuant to this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the
grantee.
   (C)   Failure to make required payments. In the event any franchise payment
or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified in this
section, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation:
      (1)   An interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate
equal to the commercial prime interest rate in effect upon the due date; and
      (2)   A sum of money equal to 5% of the amount due in order to defray
those additional expenses and costs incurred by the grantor by reason of the
delinquent payment.
   (D)   Quarterly payments. The payment due the grantor under this section
shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter, as of March 31, June
30, September 30 and December 31. Each quarterly payment shall be due and
payable no later than 30 days after such dates. Each payment shall be
accompanied by a brief report showing the basis for the computation and such
other relevant facts as may be required by the grantor.
   (E)   Credits. Following the issuance and acceptance of the franchise, the
grantee shall initiate franchise fee payments to the grantor at the minimum
rate specified in the franchise agreement. Such initial payments shall be
credited against payments due in later years of the franchise inasmuch as they
exceed the actual franchise payments due during any year.
('65 Code, § 7-8.409) (Ord. 244-C.S., passed - - )
§ 112.029 FORFEITURE OR REVOCATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Grounds for revocation. The grantor reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter and rescind all rights and
privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each
of which shall represent a default in breach under this chapter and the
franchise grant:
      (1)   If the grantee should default in the performance of any of its
material obligations under this chapter or under such documents, contracts and
other terms and provisions entered into by and between the grantor and the
grantee;
      (2)   If the grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond
required by this chapter;
      (3)   If any court of competent jurisdiction, the FCC, or any state
regulator body by rules, decisions or other action determines that any material
provision of the franchise documents, including this chapter, is invalid or
unenforceable prior to the commencement of the construction of the system;
      (4)   If the grantee should frequently violate any orders or rulings of
any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to the
franchise, unless such orders or rulings are being contested by the grantee in
a court of competent jurisdiction;
      (5)   If the grantee ceases to provide services for any reason within the
control of the grantee over the cable communications system, the grantee shall
not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of
this chapter in any case in which the performance of any such provision is
prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed
to be beyond the grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other
business entity in which the grantee holds a controlling interest, whether held
directly or indirectly;
      (6)   If the grantee attempts to evade any of the provisions of this
chapter or the franchise agreement or practices any fraud or deceit upon the
grantor;
      (7)   If the grantee's construction schedule is delayed for more than 18
months later than the schedule contained in the franchise agreement; or
      (8)   If the grantee becomes insolvent or unable or unwilling to pay its
debts or is adjudged bankrupt.
   (B)   Procedures prior to revocation.
      (1)   The grantor may make a written demand that the grantee so comply
with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or
correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or
neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 60 days following such written
demand, the grantor may place its request for the termination of the franchise
upon a regular meeting agenda of the grantor. The grantor shall cause to be
served upon the grantee, at least ten days prior to the date of such meeting, a
written notice of its intent to request such termination and the time and place
of the meeting, notice of which shall be published at least once ten days
before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the franchise
area.
      (2)   The grantor shall hear any persons interested therein and shall
determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by
the grantee was with just cause.
      (3)   If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, the grantor shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and
manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.
      (4)   If the grantor shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by
the grantee was without just cause, the grantor, by resolution, may declare
that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and the bond forfeited
unless there be compliance by the grantee within such period as the grantor may
fix.
   (C)   Disposition of facilities. In the event a franchise expires, is
revoked, or otherwise terminated, the grantor may order the removal of the
system facilities from the franchise area within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the grantor or require the original grantee to maintain and
operate its network until a subsequent grantee is selected.
   (D)   Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that
shall be made by the grantee and shall leave all public ways and places in as
good condition as that prevailing prior to the grantee's removal of its
equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone cable
wires or attachments. The grantor shall inspect and approve the condition of
the public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles
after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provided for in this
chapter and the performance bond provided for shall continue in full force and
effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by the grantee
with the terms and conditions of this section.
   (E)   Restoration by the grantor; reimbursement of costs. In the event of
the failure of the grantee to complete any work required by division (C) and/or
division (D) of this section or any other work required by city laws within the
time as may be established and to the satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor
may cause such work to be done, and the grantee shall reimburse the grantor the
cost thereof within 30 days after the receipt of an itemized list of such
costs, or the grantor may recover such costs through the security fund provided
by the grantee. The grantor shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable
relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
   (F)   Extended operation. Upon either the expiration or revocation of a
franchise, the grantor may require the grantee to continue to operate the cable
communications system for an extended period of time not to exceed 12 months
after the date of such expiration or revocation. The grantee, as trustee for
its successor in interest, shall continue to operate the cable communications
system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise
agreement and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the
services which may be provided at such time. The grantor shall be permitted to
seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
   (G)   Grantor's rights not affected. The termination and forfeiture of any
franchise shall in no way affect any of the rights of the grantor under the
franchise or any provision of law.

property and equipment of the grantee, or any part thereof, including or
excluding the franchise, the grantor may serve notice of termination upon the
grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise
granted and all rights and privileges of the grantee pursuant to this chapter

FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS
§ 112.100 REMEDIES FOR FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   If the grantee shall fail to perform any obligation under the
franchise, or fail to do so in a timely manner, the grantor, at its option and
in its sole discretion, may:
      (1)   Assess against the grantee penalties of up to $5,000 per day for
construction delays and up to $1,000 per day for all other violations, which
the grantee hereby agrees to pay, such assessment to be levied against the
security fund provided for in this chapter and collected by the grantor
immediately upon such assessment. The grantor and grantee agree that the amount
of such assessment shall be deemed, without proof, to represent the liquidation
of damages actually sustained by the grantor by reason of the grantee's failure
to perform. Such assessment shall not constitute a waiver by the grantor of any
other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, its right to recover from the grantee such
additional damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by the grantor by reason of, or
arising out of, such breach of the franchise. Such provision for the assessment
of damages is intended by the parties to be separate and apart from the
grantor's right to enforce the provisions of the construction and compliance
bonds provided for in §§
112.060 through
112.064 of this chapter and is intended to provide compensation to the grantor
for actual damages;
      (2)   For violations considered by the grantor to have materially
degraded the quality of service, order and direct the grantee to issue rebates
or reduce its rates and/or charges to subscribers in an amount solely
determined by the grantor to provide monetary relief substantially equal to the
reduced quality of service resulting from the grantee's failure to perform;
      (3)   Require the grantee to cure all defaults and breaches of its
obligations pursuant to this chapter before the grantee is entitled to increase
any rate or charge to subscribers pursuant to this chapter;
      (4)   Terminate the franchise for any of the causes set forth in §§
112.020 through
112.031 of this chapter; and
      (5)   No penalty shall be imposed by the grantor against the grantee for
any violation of the franchise without the grantee being afforded due process
of law as provided for in §
112.101 of this subchapter.
   (B)   The grantor, in its sole judgment and discretion, may impose any or
all of the measures set forth in this section against the grantee, which shall
be in addition to any and all other legal or equitable remedies the grantee has
under the franchise or under any applicable law.
('65 Code, § 7-8.1201) (Ord. 244-C.S., passed - - )
§ 112.101 REMEDIES FOR FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS; PROCEDURE.
   In the event the grantor determines that the grantee has violated any
provision of the franchise, any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to this
chapter, or any applicable federal, state, or local law, the grantor may make a
written demand on the grantee that it remedy such violation. If the violation,
breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not remedied to the satisfaction of the
grantor within 30 days following such demand, the grantor shall determine
whether or not such violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by the
grantee was excusable or inexcusable in accordance with the following
procedure:
   (A)   A public hearing shall be held, and the grantee shall be provided with
an opportunity to be heard upon 30 days written notice to the grantee of the
time and the place of the hearing and the allegations of the franchise
violations.
   (B)   If, after notice is given and at the grantee's option a full public
proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation, breach,
failure, refusal, or neglect by the grantee was excusable as provided in §
112.102 of this subchapter, the grantor shall direct the grantee to correct or
remedy the same within such additional time, in such manner, and upon such
terms and conditions as the grantor may direct.
   (C)   If, after notice is given and at the grantee's option a full public
proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation, breach,
failure, refusal, or neglect was inexcusable, the grantor may assess a penalty
or remedy in accordance with §
112.100 of this subchapter.
   (D)   If, after notice is given and at the grantee's option a full public
proceeding is held, the grantor declares the franchise or any renewal thereof
breached, the parties may pursue their remedies pursuant to the franchise or
any other remedy, legal or equitable.

   In the event the grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions,
obligations, or requirements of the franchise is prevented or impaired due to
any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such
inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused, and no penalties or
sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof provided the grantee has
notified the grantor in writing within 30 days of its discovery of the
occurrence of such an event. Such causes beyond the grantee's reasonable
control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but not be limited to,

   (D)   Special tests. At any time after the commencement of service to
subscribers, the grantor may require additional tests, full or partial repeat
tests, different test procedures, or tests involving a specific subscriber's
terminal. Requests for such additional tests shall be made on the basis of
complaints received or other evidence indicating an unresolved controversy or
significant noncompliance, and such tests will be limited to the particular
matter in controversy. The grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its requests

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 122.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds and declares as follows:
   (A)   The requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are
reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the city, while recognizing massage as a legitimate business interest that
provides benefits to its patrons in a therapeutic setting.
   (B)   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the provisions of the State
Constitution, Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 37100, 51030 et seq., Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code
§§ 460, 4600 through 4620 (The Massage Therapy Act) and 16000, and § 13 of the
Chiropractic Act (initiative measure approved by the electors November 7, 1922,
as amended).
   (C)   There is a significant risk of injury to massage clients by persons
improperly trained and/or educated in providing massage services, and this
chapter provides reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss.
   (D)   There is opportunity for acts of prostitution, lewdness, and other
unlawful sexual activity to occur in massage establishments, as well as
problems relating to human trafficking in massage establishments. Courts have
long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that massage
establishments are often brothels in disguise. The establishment of reasonable
standards for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to
reduce the risk of illegal activity and would thereby benefit the public
health.
   (E)   The provisions of this chapter are intended to enhance the efficient
processing of permits for massage establishments, owners and managers and the
ongoing regulation of those permittees and certificate holders by the city. The
provisions of this chapter in no way limit the authority of the city to inspect
massage establishments or conduct investigations to ensure permittees are
complying with applicable rules and regulations.
   (F)   The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are
intended, in part, to stop the practice of businesses quickly changing
ownership in name upon the discovery of criminal activity by the city.
   (G)   The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are
intended to be in addition to the requirement of a valid business license
issued pursuant to Title XI,
Chapter 110 of the San Gabriel Municipal Code and the requirement to obtain a
conditional use permit pursuant to
Chapter 153.
   (H)   The regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter are
intended to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of
prostitution, and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and
rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved within the confines
allowed by state law.
   (I)   The provisions of this chapter are not intended to be exclusive and
compliance therewith shall not excuse noncompliance with any state or local
laws or regulations that are uniformly applied to other professional or
personal service businesses.
   (J)   The California Massage Therapy Council (“CAMTC”) can better, and more
efficiently, regulate massage technicians in order to best protect the public
and it is in the public interest to require that all persons providing massage
in the city have a certificate from the CAMTC. However, in order to protect the
public health, safety and welfare of the residents and visitors to the City of
San Gabriel, it is necessary for the city to additionally regulate massage
establishment businesses.

CERTIFICATES OF OPERATION AND OPERATOR PERMITS
§ 122.30 CERTIFICATE OF OPERATION AND OPERATOR PERMIT REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   No person shall own or manage any massage establishment in any
location within the city without first having obtained an operator permit. An
operator permit must be obtained for each owner of a business or proposed
business, and any identified manager, in order for an application for a
conditional use permit for such business to be complete.
   (B)   No massage establishment shall be allowed to operate within the city
unless the business first obtains a certificate of operation. No certificate of
operation shall be approved until each operator identified in the application
has obtained an operator permit. A certificate of operation shall not be
granted until such time as a conditional use permit has been obtained for the
location.
   (C)   Any person desiring to obtain a certificate of operation and/or an
operator permit shall make application in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter, which application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee
in an amount established by resolution of the City Council.
   (D)   All applications shall be dated and shall contain the following
statements:
      (1)   A certification under penalty of perjury that the information
contained in the application is true and correct;
      (2)   An authorization for the city, its officers, agents and employees,
to seek information and conduct an investigation into the truth of the
statements set forth in the application and to ensure continual compliance with
all applicable provisions of law; and
      (3)   An acknowledgment that by applying for an operator permit, the
applicant understands that he or she is responsible for having a working
knowledge of the city’s regulations relating to massage establishment
operations, be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business and be
responsible for all violations of employees and independent contractors that
may take place in the massage establishment which such person owns or manages
and that such violations are grounds for revocation of the operator permit.
   (E)   The provisions of §§
122.05,
122.50,
122.51,
122.52 and
122.99 shall apply to any business that operates as a massage establishment,
even if such business fails to obtain operator permits or certificates of
operation. The city may immediately order a business that fails to have a
certificate of operation or a permitted operator on the premises to cease
operation until such failures have been resolved.
   (F)   Within 30 working days following receipt of a completed application,
the Finance Director shall either issue the certificate of operation and the
Chief of Police shall issue an operator permit or mail a written statement of
the reasons for denial thereof. Notwithstanding the above, failure of the city
to act upon a completed application within the time frame set forth above shall
not be deemed approval of the application pursuant to this chapter. Any
certificate of operation or permit issued pursuant to this division (F) shall
be deemed conditional pending the city’s receipt of the California Department
of Justice report on the applicant’s fingerprints. If the fingerprint report
demonstrates that the applicant has made any false, misleading, or fraudulent
statement of material fact in the permit application or in any report or record
required to be filed therewith, or discloses any disqualifying conduct, the
permit shall be subject to denial or revocation pursuant to this chapter.

   (G)   For any person that has a valid CAMTC certificate, the applicant shall
only be required to provide the information specified in division (B)(1)
through (B)(4) and have his or her picture taken or provide a photograph as

      (1)   The full name of the applicant;
      (2)   The name under which the business is to be conducted, which name

certificate is issued under
Chapter 110. No massage establishment business shall operate under any business

of operation. If the applicant is a corporation, the name shall be exactly as
shown on the articles of incorporation or on a valid DBA (“doing business as”);
      (3)   The address of the proposed massage establishment;
      (4)   A detailed description of the operation and type of services to be

operation of the massage establishment if other than the owner(s);
      (6)   A legal size copy of the floor plan approved as part of the
conditional use permit, drawn to scale with measurements in feet and inches and
labeled in English. The floor plan shall show: entrances; exits; windows;
interior doors; restrooms; all other separately enclosed rooms with dimensions,
including, but not limited to closets, storerooms, break rooms, and changing
rooms; and location of massage tables and chairs;
      (7)   The full name, address, and phone number of the legal owner of the
property, if other than the applicant on which the massage establishment is to
be located, along with a copy of the signed lease and a notarized
acknowledgment from the owner of the property that a massage establishment will
be located on his or her property; and
      (8)   The hours and days of operation.
   (B)   The Finance Director shall issue a certificate of operation upon
verification of the following:

including, but not limited to building, fire, zoning, health, and safety
regulations, as well as any conditions which have been imposed to comply with
such laws;
      (2)   Each person identified as an operator, i.e., the owner(s) and
manager(s), has obtained an operator permit; and
      (3)   A conditional use permit, if required, has been obtained.
      (4)   Any decision to deny the certificate of operation shall be made in
writing and shall set forth the reasons for the decision. The notice shall
include a statement of appeal rights pursuant to §
122.34 below.
   (C)   Every massage establishment for which a certificate of operation has
been granted pursuant to this chapter shall display the certificate in a
conspicuous place so it may be readily seen by persons entering the premises.
   (D)   A certificate of operation is not transferable to a separate location
of the same business, to a different business at the same location, or to the
same business under different ownership at the same location, or the same
business under a different name.
   (E)   It is the duty of each operator to notify the Finance Department
whenever there is a change in information which was required to be submitted in
the application for the certificate of operation in the first instance. Any
sale or transfer of any reportable interest of an owner in a massage
establishment, which interest would be required to be reported under division
(A) of this section in the first instance, shall render the certificate of
operation temporarily suspended and subject to revocation in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter unless prior to the effective date of such sale
or transfer, the new owner applies for and obtains an operator permit.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary,
where a notice of suspension or revocation has been issued regarding a massage
establishment, or the business has otherwise been required to close because of
suspension or revocation proceedings against the operator, the Finance
Department shall not process or issue a new application for a certificate of
operation for said location unless or until the revocation or suspension
proceedings are dismissed or a final determination is made that the current
certificate of operation should not be suspended or revoked, or a two-year
period has passed since the occurrence of the activity which gave rise to the
suspension or revocation proceedings or other criminal actions.
   (G)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, when
a massage establishment has been closed due to criminal activity and such
decision is final, no new massage establishment may open in such location and
no certificate of operation shall be issued for such location for a period of
two years from the date of such final determination. For purposes of this
section, closure due to criminal activity includes voluntary closure of the
business after there have been arrests at the location or other notices
relating to criminal activity or notices relating to suspension or revocation
proceedings. This provision is not meant to prohibit the issuance of a
certificate of operation to a business which initially failed to obtain a
certificate of operation without any prior oral or written notification by the
city that such was required.
   (H)   Where the applicant for the certificate of operation is not the record
owner, as shown on the latest county assessment roll, then upon issuance of the
certificate, the city shall send written notice to the property owner advising
of the issuance of the certificate and the regulations applicable to the
massage establishment and the property pursuant to this chapter; this may be
accomplished by including a copy of this chapter with the notice.

§ 122.33 SUSPENSION, REVOCATION AND NONRENEWAL OF OPERATOR PERMITS AND
CERTIFICATES OF OPERATION.
   (A)   Subject to the procedures set forth in this section, the Chief of
Police may suspend or revoke a permit, or determine not to renew an operator
permit, issued pursuant to this chapter whenever the Chief of Police determines
that any of the following has occurred:
      (1)   The permittee, or an employee or independent contractor working on
the premises, is conducting operations in a manner contrary to the provisions
of this code;
      (2)   The permittee, or an employee or independent contractor working on
the premises, is conducting operations in a manner which constitutes a public
nuisance;
      (3)   The permittee, or an employee or independent contractor working on
the premises, is conducting operations in a manner which is detrimental to the
health, safety, or welfare of the city or its inhabitants;
      (4)   There is substantial evidence of prostitution;
      (5)   The permittee, or any employee or independent contractor working on
the premises, has engaged in disqualifying conduct; or
      (6)   The Chief of Police makes any of the findings that would have
justified denying the application in the first instance.
   (B)   If, in the discretion of the Chief of Police, an alleged violation is
minor and capable of correction and there have not been previous violations by
the operator or the massage establishment, then prior to suspension or
revocation a written notice may be given to the permittee of the alleged
violation(s) involved to allow a period of time to correct the alleged
violation(s). Such period shall not exceed five business days, at the end of
which period, an inspection shall be conducted to determine whether the alleged
violation(s) has been corrected. For purposes of this section, written notice
shall include a notice of violation, an administrative citation, or a criminal
citation.
   (C)   If the Chief of Police determines that an alleged violation is not
minor or capable of correction, that an alleged violation(s) continues without
correction, or that there have been previous violations of this chapter, even
if for different reasons, then the Chief of Police may issue a notice of
suspension or revocation, along with an administrative or criminal citation.
Examples of a violation which will be determined by the Chief of Police to be
not capable of correction include but are not limited to substantial evidence
of prostitution activity on the massage establishment premises or an immediate
threat to public health, safety, or welfare.
   (D)   Notice of suspension, revocation or non-renewal. A notice of
suspension or revocation, or a notice of non-renewal of an operator permit,
shall contain a statement of the violation(s) which constitutes the basis for
the suspension or revocation, notice of the right to appeal to the City Manager
in accordance with §
122.34, and notice that a failure to appeal shall constitute a failure to
exhaust administrative remedies. If an alleged violation is capable of
correction, the notice shall also advise the permittee to correct the alleged
violation(s) within the time to respond.
   (E)   Unless the notice provides otherwise, the effective date of the
suspension or revocation shall be the deadline to file an appeal, or, if an
appeal is filed, the date that notice of a decision suspending or revoking a
permit is served.
   (F)   Where all massage activity is required to cease, notice shall also be
served on the owner of the property if different from the operator or
certificate holder.
   (G)   The notice shall include information about the right to appeal.
   (H)   Surrender of certificate of operation and permits. Any permittee shall
immediately surrender his or her permit to the Chief of Police upon the
effective date of its suspension or revocation. The operator shall immediately
surrender the certificate of operation upon revocation of an operator permit if
there is no other permitted operator for the massage establishment.

applicable basis for the appeal and shall be filed with the City Clerk no later

      (2)   The City Clerk shall not accept an appeal, and no hearing shall be
held, unless the appellant has paid a filing fee, in an amount set by
resolution of the City Council, to defray the cost of such appeal. Any appeal
without the timely payment of fees shall be considered to be untimely.

limited to those issues raised by the appellant in the written appeal, as
submitted pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section.

and witnesses shall not apply. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is
material and if it is evidence customarily relied upon by responsible persons
in the conduct of their affairs regardless of the existence of any common law
or statutory rule which might make admission of such evidence improper over
objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be admissible if it is the
sort upon which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of
serious affairs. The rules of privilege shall be applicable to the extent they
are now, or are hereafter permitted in civil actions. Irrelevant, collateral,
and repetitious testimony shall be excluded.
         (c)   In determining whether a person should be disqualified for
meeting the definition of PERSON WHO HAS ENGAGED IN DISQUALIFYING CONDUCT as
set forth in §
122.02, the City Manager may consider: the nature and severity of the act(s) or
crime(s); whether there were any additional subsequent act(s) or crime(s); the
number of act(s) or crime(s); and how recent the act(s) or crime(s) were.
      (4)   The appellant shall have the burden of proving that he or she meets
the requirements for issuing the permit or certificate in the first instance;
the city shall have the burden in proving that grounds exist for suspending,
revoking or failing to renew a permit.
      (5)   Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the City Manager
shall determine whether the decision should be affirmed, modified, or reversed.
      (6)   The City Manager shall issue his decision within ten business days
after the close of the hearing. The City Manager’s decision shall include a
statement of the reasons therefor.
      (7)   The decision of the City Manager shall include notice that the
decision is final and conclusive, that judicial review may be sought therefrom
pursuant to Cal. Civil Proc. Code § 1094.5, and that any action filed in the
superior court shall be filed within 90 days following the City Manager’s
notice pursuant to Cal. Civil Proc. Code § 1094.6.

States mail in a sealed envelope postage prepaid addressed to such responsible
party as the name and address appear in the most recent application on file

(Ord. 585-C.S., passed 3-2-10)
§ 125.02 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

intended to regulate tobacco sales and use, local laws need to be enhanced to
ensure compliance and maximize their effectiveness in protecting the public’s
health, especially that of the more vulnerable youth. The purpose of this
subchapter is to discourage violations of laws which prohibit or discourage
sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors in the city. It is not the
purpose of this subchapter to expand or reduce the degree to which the acts
regulated by federal or state law are criminally proscribed, or to alter the
penalty provided therefor.
(Ord. 585-C.S., passed 3-2-10)

An ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a person has a 10% or
greater interest in the stock, assets or income of a business other than the
sole interest of security for debt. A managerial interest shall be deemed to
exist when a person can or does have, or can or does share, ultimate control
over the day-to- day operations of a business.

of smoking materials of all types, cigarette rolling machines, and other items

126.99   Penalty
§ 126.01 LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE.
   Many retail establishments provide shopping carts for the convenience of
customers while shopping on the business premises. However, shopping carts
removed from the premises of such businesses and left abandoned on public or
private property throughout the city constitute a public nuisance and a
potential hazard to the health and safety of the public. The abundance of lost,
stolen, or abandoned shopping carts on public and private property causes
blighting conditions in the community, results in the obstruction of free
access to public and private sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and interferes
with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on public and private streets, and
impedes emergency services. The purpose of this chapter is to establish
regulations to ensure that measures are taken by the owners and operators of
businesses which provide ten or more shopping carts to prevent the removal of
shopping carts from the business premises and provide prompt retrieval of lost,
stolen, or abandoned shopping carts, to complement state law, and adopt local
regulations to the extent not otherwise preempted by state statute.
(Ord. 584-C.S., passed 6-1-10)
§ 126.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDONED SHOPPING CART. A shopping cart removed from the business premises
by any person without the written consent of the owner of the shopping cart or
the retailer entitled to possession of the cart, or a cart left unattended,
discarded, or abandoned outside the business premises or parking lot or
facility of the business establishment which furnishes the shopping cart for
patrons.
   BUSINESS PREMISES. The entirety of a commercial or industrial site upon
which a cart provider conducts a commercial establishment, including, but not
limited to, the interior of the cart provider’s commercial establishment,
adjacent walkways, any associated loading and parking areas provided on that
site or provided on private property in conjunction with the commercial or
industrial establishment.
   CART PROVIDER. The owner or operator of a business who provides ten or more
carts for use by its customers for the purpose of transporting goods of any
kind.
   PHYSICAL CONTAINMENT SYSTEM. Devices on all shopping carts, which prevent
them from being removed from the business premises by locking the wheels or
otherwise preventing the movement of the shopping carts off the business
premises or from the businesses entrance/exit.
   SHOPPING CART. Any basket of any size, mounted on wheels or other similar
device provided by the store operator for the purpose of transporting goods of
any kind within a business establishment or designated parking or loading area
of that business establishment.
(Ord. 584-C.S., passed 6-1-10)
§ 126.03 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Community Development Director or his or her designee shall oversee the
implementation, administration, and enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 584-C.S., passed 6-1-10)
§ 126.04 CART CONTAINMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided, it shall be unlawful for owners or
operators of any establishment that provides ten or more carts to provide or
offer, or permit to be offered, any shopping carts to customers of the retail
establishment without an approved mandatory cart containment system meeting one
or all of the following criteria:
      (1)   Installation of disabling devices on all carts, which are activated
when they cross a barrier at the entrance/exit to the business structure or the
perimeter of the premises. If the cart provider’s containment system is found
to be ineffective by city staff the cart provider will be required to modify
the existing system or implement a new containment system within 30 days of
said finding. Cart providers may not lose more than three carts a day to be
considered effective.
      (2)   Installation of the physical containment system required shall be
completed prior to the issuance of a business license to any cart provider for
any business opened after the effective date of this chapter.
      (3)   For each cart provider whose business is legally in operation
before the effective date of this chapter, a six-month implementation period
will be provided to allow the cart provider time to evaluate its own rates of
cart loss and to secure and install an effective containment system. Any such
cart provider who has not installed a physical containment system at the
conclusion of the six-month period from the effective date of this chapter
shall be in violation of the San Gabriel Municipal Code. An extension may be
given at the discretion of the city’s Development Services Director or his or
her designee.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any retail establishment to
provide or offer, or permit to be provided or offered, to customers of the
retail establishment any shopping cart which does not have a sign permanently
affixed thereto containing all of the information required by Cal. Bus. & Prof.
Code § 22435.1.
(Ord. 584-C.S., passed 6-1-10) Penalty, see §

collect all shopping carts located on the premises and confine them in a cart
containment area at the end of each business day (other than an establishment
open for business 24 hours per day).

intimidating conduct. Such conduct further jeopardizes the city's economy by
discouraging visitors, tourists and prospective customers from coming to San
Gabriel for business, recreation and shopping. Such conduct also threatens to
drive city residents to places outside of San Gabriel for their recreation and
shopping activities. Such conduct further undermines the public's basic right
to be in and enjoy public places without fear that they will be pursued or
intimidated by persons seeking handouts. Further, it is necessary to place
reasonable restrictions upon the time, place and manner in which panhandling
occurs in order to protect the public health and safety.

(Ord. 688, passed 5-2-23)
§ 130.22 VANDALISM.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of the City Council
of the city, through the adoption of this section, to provide additional
abatement and enforcement tools to protect public and private property from
acts of vandalism and defacement; especially, but not limited to, graffiti on
privately and publicly owned property, which is inimical and destructive of the
rights and values of private property owners as well as the total community.
The majority of those individuals who paint graffiti seek notoriety and
recognition as they attach status to having their work seen. Prolonged
visibility due to the sheer volume, scale and complexity of the graffiti, and
placement of the graffiti in hard-to-reach places, enhance the perpetrator's
satisfaction. Therefore, the swift removal or painting over of graffiti in
combination with criminal prosecution of the persons who create it is the most
effective way of combating this very serious problem. It is further the intent
of the City Council, through the adoption of this section, to provide notice to
all of those who callously disregard the property rights of others, that the
law enforcement agencies of the city, both the Police Department and the
prosecutor's office, will strictly enforce the law and severely prosecute those
persons engaging in the defacement of public and private properties.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different

EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION IN EXISTING BUILDINGS
§ 150.080 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to promote public safety and welfare
by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings constructed before
1934. Such buildings have been widely recognized for their sustaining of life
hazardous damage as a result of partial or complete collapse during past
moderate to strong earthquakes.
   (B)   The provisions of this subchapter are minimum standards for structural
seismic resistance, established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or
injury, and will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent
earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these standards.
This subchapter shall not require existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or
fire safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or
property.
   (C)   This subchapter provides systematic procedures and standards for
identification and classification of unreinforced masonry bearing wall
buildings based on their present use. Priorities, time periods and standards
are also established under which these buildings are required to be
structurally analyzed and anchored. Where the analysis determines deficiencies,
this subchapter requires the building to be strengthened or demolished.

prevent pointing with mortar of all the masonry wall joints before the tests
are first made. Prior to any pointing, the mortar joints must be raked and
cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar for pointing shall be
Type S or N except masonry cements shall not be used. All preparation and
mortar pointing shall be done under the continuous inspection of a registered
deputy building inspector. At the conclusion of the inspection, the inspector
shall submit a written report to the licensed engineer or architect responsible
for the seismic analysis of the building setting forth the result of the work
inspected. Such report shall be submitted to the Department for approval as
part of the structural analysis. All testing shall be performed in accordance
with the requirements specified in this division by a testing agency approved
by the Department. An accurate record of all such tests and their location in
the building shall be recorded and these results shall be submitted to the
Department for approval as part of the structural analysis.
      (2)   Number and location of tests. The minimum number of tests shall be
two per wall or line of wall elements resisting a common force, or one per 1500
square feet of wall surface, with a minimum of eight tests in any case. The
exact test or core location shall be determined at the building site by the
licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the
subject building.
      (3)   In-place shear tests. The bed joints of the outer wythe of the
masonry shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick
relative to the adjacent bricks in that wythe. The opposite head joint of the
brick to be tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing. The minimum
quality mortar in 80% of the shear tests shall not be less than the total of 30
psi plus the axial stress in the wall at the point of the test. The shear
stress shall be based on the gross area of both bed joints and shall be that at
which movement of the brick is first observed.
      (4)   Core tests. A minimum number of mortar test specimens equal to the
number of required cores shall be prepared from the cores and tested as
specified herein. The mortar joint of the outer wythe of the masonry core shall
be tested in shear by placing the circular core section in a compression
testing machine with the mortar bed joint rotated 15 degrees from the axis of
the applied load. The mortar joint tested in shear shall have an average
ultimate stress of 20 psi based on the gross area. The average shall be
obtained from the total number of cores made. If test specimens cannot be made
from cores taken, then the shear value shall be reported as zero.
   (F)   Testing of shear bolts.
      (1)   One-fourth of all new shear bolts and dowels embedded in
unreinforced masonry walls shall be tested by a registered deputy building
inspector using a torque calibrated wrench to the following minimum torques:
   1/2-inch-diameter bolts or dowels — 40 foot-lbs.
   5/8-inch-diameter bolts or dowels — 50 foot-lbs.
   3/4-inch-diameter bolts or dowels — 60 foot-lbs.
      (2)   No bolts exceeding three-fourths inch shall be used. All nuts shall
be installed over malleable iron or plate washers when bearing on wood and
heavy cut washers when bearing on steel.
   (G)   Determination of allowable stresses for design methods based on test
results.
      (1)   Design shear values. Design seismic in-plane shear stresses shall
be substantiated by tests performed as specified in divisions (E)(3) and (4) of
this section. Design stresses shall be related to test results obtained in
accordance with § 10 of the appendix following this chapter. Intermediate
values between three and ten psi may be interpolated.
      (2)   Design compression and tension values. Compression stresses for
unreinforced masonry having a minimum design shear value of three psi shall not
exceed 100 psi. Design tension values for unreinforced masonry shall not be
permitted.
   (H)   Five percent of the existing rod anchors utilized as all or part of
the required wall anchors shall be tested in pullout by an approved testing
laboratory. The minimum number tested shall be four per floor, with two tests
at walls with joists framing into the wall and two tests at walls with joists
parallel to the wall. The test apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall
at a minimum distance of the wall thickness from the anchor tested. The rod
anchor shall be given a preload of 300 pounds prior to establishing a datum for
recording elongation. The tension test load reported shall be recorded at one-
eighth inch relative movement of the anchor and the adjacent masonry surface.
Results of all tests shall be reported. The report shall include the test
results as related to the wall thickness and joist orientation. The allowable
resistance value of the existing anchors shall be 40% of the average of those
tested anchors having the same wall thickness and joist orientation.
   (I)   Qualification tests for devices used for wall anchorage shall be
tested with the entire tension load carried on the enlarged head at the
exterior face of the wall. Bond on the part of the device between the enlarged
head and the interior wall face shall be eliminated for the qualification
tests. The resistance value assigned the device shall be 20% of the average of
the ultimate loads.

information as are deemed necessary; and
   (S)   The Planning Commission shall make investigations and reports on the
design and improvement of any proposed division of real property for which a
tentative map, parcel map, or minor subdivision map is filed, and shall have
the authority to impose requirements and conditions upon such division of land,
and to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove such map and division of
land. The Community Development Director shall advise and assist in making
investigations and reports on tentative maps.

indicates, the presence of critically expansive soils or other soils problems
which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soils
investigation of each lot in the subdivision may be required by the Community
Development Director. Such soils investigation shall be done by a civil
engineer registered in the state, who shall recommend the corrective action
which is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure proposed to be
constructed in the area where such soils problem exists.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may approve the subdivision or portion
thereof, where such soils problems exist if the Planning Commission determines
that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each
structure to be constructed, and a condition to the issuance of any building

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES (C-1, C-3, AND M-1)
§ 153.150 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   General provisions. Two commercial and one industrial zone districts
are established to preserve and enhance areas throughout the city for a variety
of business activities that contribute to the economic well-being of the
community. These provisions are set forth to ensure the compatible and
mutually-beneficial interaction of commercial and industrial uses with
residential consumers, to encourage quality development projects, and to
accommodate the varied needs of the business community.
   (B)   Retail Commercial Zone (C-1). The Retail Commercial (C-1) Zone is
intended to provide for the continued use and development of low-scale, local
community-oriented retail sales and service uses. All permanent uses within
this district must be located within an entirely enclosed structure. Typical
uses include neighborhood-oriented retail and personal service businesses,
small professional offices, and other businesses that generate low volumes of
vehicle traffic.
   (C)   General Commercial Zone (C-3). The General Commercial (C-3) Zone is
intended to provide for the continued use and expansion and new development of
a wide variety of commercial enterprises, professional and medical offices,
entertainment uses, and similar businesses. The zone is located along major
roadway corridors to encourage uses that serve the local and regional markets.
Mixed-use, (i.e. a mix of commercial/residential uses) is allowed subject to
applicable permit requirements and light manufacturing uses associated with on-
premises retail sales are allowed under a conditional use permit (CUP).
   (D)   Light Manufacturing Zone (M-1). The Light Manufacturing (M-1) Zone is
intended to preserve and create areas where small- to moderate-sized, clean
industries may locate and operate in a manner that does not pose health or
environmental risks to surrounding land uses.

§ 153.151 USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The table in division (D) of this section identifies which uses are
permitted by right, permitted subject to conditional use permit review and
approval, permitted as temporary uses, and prohibited in the C-1, C-3, and M-
1 zones.
   (B)   In the event that a specific use or type of use is not listed in the
table in division (D) below, the Community Development Director shall have the
authority to determine which listed use is most similar to the proposed use and
thereby determine whether the proposed use is permitted, permitted subject to
conditional use permit review and approval, permitted as a temporary use, or
prohibited. The City Council shall be notified of the decision within seven
calendar days, and a permanent record of such decisions shall be maintained.
   (C)   The decision of the Community Development Director can be appealed to
the Planning Commission.

§ 153.164 MIXED USE IN THE C-1 AND C-3 ZONE DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose. These mixed-use provisions are established to provide for the
compatible and beneficial mixture of commercial, office, and residential uses
in a single structure or on a single site. Mixed-use development is designed to
achieve a convenient business/residential environment in areas where multiple
activities are considered to be desirable. Mixed-use development also serves as
a transition or buffer between residential uses and commercial uses. In
addition, mixed-use development can add to the city’s supply of affordable
housing; reduce commutes between home and work; and promote strong, stable, and
desirable pedestrian-oriented business environments.
   (B)   Permitted uses. Multi-family residential uses are only permitted on
the second and third floors above ground floor commercial or office uses
permitted in the C-1 and C-3 Zone. Ground floor multi-family residential uses
are only permitted in mixed-use developments in excess of three acres.
   (C)   Development standards. All mixed-use developments shall comply with
the provisions established for the C-1 and C-3 Zone, except as modified in this
subchapter. The following standards shall apply to all mixed-use developments.
      (1)   Parking. The number of off-street parking spaces required for
specific uses shall be in compliance with the provisions set forth in §
153.220 herein, except as modified in this subchapter. All multi-family
residential uses shall be provided with one parking space per bedroom which
shall be located in a garage or carport. However, units designated for senior
citizens (62 years of age or older) shall be provided at a rate of 0.75 spaces
per unit (covered or uncovered). Guest parking for the multi-family residential
uses shall be provided at a rate of one space for every three multi-family
residential units. Tandem parking may be used only for the spaces which are
assigned and designated for a single residential unit. Additionally, parking
for residential units shall be separate and secured.
      (2)   Multi-family density. For mixed-use development projects which abut
R-1 or R-2 zoned property or equivalently zoned properties in unincorporated
Los Angeles County, the minimum site area shall be 3,960 square feet of net lot
area for each multi-family dwelling unit. If the mixed-use development projects
abuts any other zone, the minimum site area shall be 1,452 square feet of net
lot area for each family dwelling unit. Density bonuses shall be allowed in
accordance with the provisions established in the California Government Code §
65915.
      (3)   Floor area ratio. The maximum floor area ratio (F.A.R.) for the
entire development shall not exceed one time the total net lot area. Multi-
family residential uses shall be a minimum of 25% of the total net lot area,
but shall not exceed 50% of the total net lot area.
      (4)   Lot coverage. Buildings and all accessory buildings shall not
occupy more than 55% of the total net lot area which abuts an R-1 or R-2 Zone
or equivalently zoned properties in unincorporated Los Angeles County, or 60%
of the total net lot area which abut any other zone.
      (5)   Height limit. For mixed-use development projects which abut R-1 or
R-2 zoned properties or equivalently-zoned properties in unincorporated Los
Angeles County, the maximum building height is two stories or 35 feet. For
mixed-use development projects which abut any other zone, the maximum height is
three stories or 45 feet.
      (6)   Front yards. The following front yard setback areas shall be
provided for mixed-use development projects:
         (a)   No front yard setback shall be required for commercial use
floors, however, a front setback may be required through the Precise Plan of
Design review or Conditional Use Permit process.
         (b)   Residential use floors shall maintain a minimum five foot
setback beyond the commercial floors.
      (7)   Side yard. For mixed-use development projects which abut a
residential zone, there shall be a minimum ten foot setback. There shall not be
a required side yard for mixed-use development projects which abut any other
zone. However, on corner lots, the side yard on the street side shall be not
less that ten feet.
      (8)   Rear yards. The rear yard for a mixed-use development project shall
be not less than 15 feet.
      (9)   Storage. A minimum of one 90-cubic-foot lockable, enclosed storage
space per residential unit must be provided.
      (10)   Trash enclosures. Separate trash facilities shall be provided for
the residential and non- residential components of the development.

the ground level shall have minimum dimension of ten feet. Open space areas
located above the ground level shall have a minimum dimension of six feet.
         (b)   For mixed-use developments in excess of three acres, a
pedestrian plaza, community garden, or other open space area shall be proved as
an aesthetic and usable passive recreation amenity. The area of the open space
shall be determined through the conditional use permit review process. All open
areas shall be unobstructed from the ground upward, unless covered by a roof or
balcony supported entirely by the building. All open space areas not landscaped
must be developed with either reflection pools, fountains, pedestrian walkways,
rest areas, or other similar improvements.
      (12)   (Reserved)
      (13)   Maximum uninterrupted building facade length. One public entrance

§ 153.166 TRASH/RECYCLING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   Any new development project within the city which is either commercial,
industrial, or light manufacturing or any enlargement of an existing
commercial, industrial or light manufacturing structure by more than 25% of the
existing gross floor area, shall be required to provide a trash enclosure area
for the collection and loading of recyclable materials. The dimensions and

(Ord. 508-C.S., passed 11-7-00)
§ 153.167 SUPPLEMENTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following supplemental standards apply to commercial and mixed-use
development in the C-l and C-3 Districts to create a pedestrian friendly
environment. The figures contained in this section are for illustrative
purposes only and do not imply that the concept illustrated be implemented
precisely as shown but rather in a manner consistent with the purpose of these
regulations.
   (A)   Orientation of primary building entrance. The primary building
entrance shall face or be oriented to the street frontage. Where a site is
located on two public streets, a primary entrance shall be oriented toward the
street with the higher classification. If a site fronts two public streets of
equal classification, the applicant may choose which frontage on which street
to meet the requirement.
   (B)   Building transparency/required openings. Exterior walls facing and
within 20 feet of a front or street side lot line shall include windows, doors,
or other openings for at least 50% of the building wall area located between
two and one-half and seven feet above the level of the sidewalk. Such walls may
run in a continuous plane for no more than 30 feet without an opening.
   FIGURE 153.167-(A): BUILDING TRANSPARENCY/ REQUIRED OPENINGS

IMAGES/0-0-0-6241.jpg]
 
      (1)   Design of required openings. Openings fulfilling this requirement
shall have transparent glazing and provide views into work areas, display
areas, sales areas, lobbies, or similar active spaces, or into window displays
that are at least three feet deep.
      (2)   Exceptions for parking garages. Multi-level garages are not
required to meet the ground-floor transparency requirement. Instead, they must
be designed and screened, consistent with the requirements of the off-street
parking subchapter (§§
153.220 through
153.229).
      (3)   Exceptions for historic buildings. Adaptive reuse projects that
incorporate architectural preservation methods as recommended by the City
Preservation Architect are not required to meet the ground-floor transparency
requirement as an incentive for historic preservation. The final determination
shall be made by the Design Review Commission and/or the Historic Preservation
and Cultural Resource Commission.
      (4)   Reductions through design review. The building transparency
requirement may be reduced or waived if it is found that:
         (a)   The proposed use has unique operational characteristics with
which providing the required windows and openings is incompatible, such as in
the case of a cinema or theater: and
         (b)   Street-facing building walls will exhibit architectural relief
and detail, and will be enhanced with landscaping in such a way as to create
visual interest at the pedestrian level.
   (C)   Building articulation. Buildings shall provide adequate architectural
articulation and detail to avoid a bulky and “box-like” appearance and to
create a pedestrian friendly environment.
      (1)   All street-facing facades shall have relief in plane and texture.
      (2)   Building facades shall include building projections or recesses,
doorway and window trim, and other details that provide architectural
articulation and design interest.
      (3)   Each side of the building that is visible from a public right-of-
way shall be designed with a complementary level of detailing.
   (D)   Pedestrian access. A system of pedestrian walkways shall connect all
buildings on a site to each other, to on-site automobile and bicycle parking
areas, and to any on-site open space areas or pedestrian amenities.
      (1)   To street network. Regular connections between on-site walkways and
the public sidewalk shall be provided. An on-site walkway shall connect the
primary building entry or entries to a public sidewalk on each street frontage.
      (2)   To neighbors. Direct and convenient access shall be provided from
commercial and mixed-use projects to adjoining residential and commercial areas
to the maximum extent feasible while still providing for safety and security.
      (3)   To transit. Safe and convenient pedestrian connections shall be
provided from transit stops to building entrances.
   (E)   Limitations on location of parking. Parking shall be located behind or
to the side of buildings.
   (F)   Limitations on curb cuts. Curb cuts shall be minimized and placed in
the location least likely to impede pedestrian circulation. Curb cuts shall be
located at least ten feet from an intersection curb return or pedestrian cross
walk.

parking facility.
   (B)   Where the parcel(s) providing the parking facilities is under separate
ownership than the parcel developed with the use for which the parking
facilities are provided, the parking facilities and incidental uses described
in (A)(1) and (A)(2) above are permitted under a conditional use permit.
However, as a condition of establishing such off-site parking facilities, the
Community Development Director shall require the applicant to enter into and
maintain a long-term lease with the owner of the property allowing the site to
be used for off-site parking purposes. The lease shall remain in effect for as
long as the use served continues to remain. Also, the lessee shall enter into
agreement with the city to maintain the parking facilities for as long as the
lease remains in effect.

OFF-STREET PARKING
§ 153.220 NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
   (A)   Required spaces. The table at the end of this section specifies the
number of off-street parking spaces required for specific uses. The requirement
for a use not specifically mentioned shall be the same as for a specified use
which has the most similar traffic and/or parking generating characteristics.
The Community Development Director shall determine what constitutes similar
traffic-generating characteristics.
   (B)   Fractional spaces. If the calculation of required parking spaces
results in a fractional number, that number shall be rounded up to the next
whole number.
   (C)   Handicapped parking. Parking for handicapped persons shall be provided
pursuant to the provisions of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.

Abbreviations:
SF = Square Feet
GFA = Gross Floor Area
GLA = Gross Land Area
 
   (E)   Small commercial uses exempt. In any district where they are
permitted, general commercial uses which require one space/250 square feet of
gross floor area or lower parking ratio are not required to provide on-site
parking when they contain less than 1,500 square feet of floor area. However,
when more than four such establishments are located on a single lot, their
floor areas shall be aggregated with all other establishments located on the
lot in order to determine required parking. This exemption does not apply to
restaurants, bars, night clubs, or other uses that have a more intensive
parking requirement.
   (F)   Reconstruction, expansion and change in use of existing non-
residential buildings. When a change in use, expansion of a use, or expansion
of floor area creates an increase of 10% or more in the number of required on-
site parking or loading spaces, additional on-site parking and loading shall be
provided only for the incremental increase in required parking and loading
spaces created by such addition, enlargement, or change in use. The existing
parking shall be maintained.
      (1)   If a building or site has existing legal parking spaces in greater
number than the prescribed minimum requirements for such use, the number of
spaces exceeding the prescribed minimum may be counted toward meeting the
parking requirements for the addition, enlargement, or change in use.
      (2)   If a building or site has existing legal parking spaces lesser in
number than the prescribed minimum requirements for such use, the number of
parking spaces required by the existing use may be credited to a new use.
      (3)   A change in occupancy is not considered a change in use unless the
new occupant is a different use type, as defined by the latest adopted edition
of the California Building Code, than the former occupant.
      (4)   Additional parking spaces are not required for the reconstruction
of an existing building when there is no increase in floor area.
   (G)   Tandem parking and valet parking.
      (1)   Tandem parking. Tandem parking may be permitted to satisfy the off-
street parking requirement in accordance with the following:
         (a)   No more than two vehicles shall be placed one behind the other.
         (b)   Both spaces shall be assigned to a single dwelling unit or
nonresidential establishment.
         (c)   Tandem parking to meet required parking for non-residential uses
shall not exceed 50% of the total number of spaces required for non-residential
uses. Tandem parking will only be allowed for non-residential uses if valet
parking is used.
         (d)   Tandem parking to meet required parking for residential multi-
unit development shall be located within an enclosed structure; the maximum
number of tandem parking spaces shall not exceed 50% of the total number of
spaces required for residential uses.
         (e)   Tandem parking shall not be used to meet the guest parking
requirement.
      (2)   Valet parking. Valet parking permitted according to the conditions
of §
153.228 may be used to satisfy up to 100% of the total amount of required
commercial parking. Valet parked vehicles must be stored in a private parking
area and not on public right-of-way.
   (H)   Parking reduction. The number of on-site parking spaces required by
this section may be reduced as follows, subject to Planning Commission approval
of a conditional use permit.
      (1)   Transportation demand and trip reduction measures. The number of
required parking spaces for any project that incorporates transportation demand
and trip reduction measures as provided in §
153.402 may be reduced by 20% of the normally required number of spaces.
      (2)   Transportation management association. The number of required
parking spaces for any project that is located on a property belonging to a
transportation management association may be reduced by 20% of the normally
required number of spaces. A TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION shall mean a
public-private partnership created to cooperatively provide transportation
demand management programs, trip reduction programs, and/or transportation
services in a defined geographic area.
      (3)   Transit accessibility. For any land use except residential single-
unit and duplex development, if any portion of the lot is located within one-
quarter mile of a transit stop with regular, scheduled service during the
weekday hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.. the number
of required parking spaces may be reduced by 20% of the normally required
number of spaces.
      (4)   Motorcycle or bicycle parking. Motorcycle or bicycle parking may
substitute for up to 5% of required automobile parking. Each motorcycle space
must be at least four feet wide and seven feet deep. Bicycle parking spaces
shall comply with §
153.229.
      (5)   Shared parking. Where a shared parking facility serving more than
one use will be provided, the total number of required parking spaces may be
reduced up to 40% with Planning Commission approval of a conditional use
permit, if the Commission finds that:
         (a)   The peak hours of use will not overlap or coincide to the degree
that peak demand for parking spaces from all uses will be greater than the
total supply of spaces:
         (b)   The proposed shared parking provided will be adequate to serve
each use;
         (c)   A parking demand study prepared by an independent traffic
engineering professional and approved by the city supports the proposed
reduction; and
         (d)   In the case of a shared parking facility that serves more than
one property, a legally acceptable covenant is executed and recorded to
guarantee the maintenance of the required spaces.
      (6)   Parking reductions allowed by division (H)(1) through (H)(5) above
may not be combined.
      (7)   Required findings. The Planning Commission may only approve a
conditional use permit for reduced parking allowed by division (H)(1) through
(H)(5) above if it finds that:
         (a)   Special conditions—including, but not limited to, the nature of
the proposed operation; proximity to frequent transit service; transportation
characteristics of persons residing, working, or visiting the site; or because
the applicant has undertaken a transportation demand management program—exist
that will reduce parking demand at the site;
         (b)   The use will adequately be served by the proposed on-site
parking;
         (c)   Parking demand generated by the project will not exceed the
capacity of or have a detrimental impact on the supply of on-street parking in
the surrounding area.
         (d)   In order to evaluate a proposed project’s compliance with the
above criteria, the Director may require submittal of a parking demand study
that substantiates the basis for granting a reduced number of spaces.

§ 153.224 DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICATIONS.
   All off-street parking areas, whether or not required by this title, and all
automobile, boat, truck, and trailer sales areas, shall be improved as follows:
   (A)   Surfacing. All off-street parking areas and driveways shall be
improved with surfacing materials as specified by the Community Development
Director, and shall be maintained in good condition. Parking lot paving should
be a balance of permeable and impermeable materials. Asphalt or concrete
(impermeable) paving should be used in high volume or drive aisle traffic areas
whereas permeable paving may be used in parking stalls. To best take advantage
of the permeable paving, parking lots should slope to drain to the perimeter
permeable paving. Bioswales or infiltration planters should be located adjacent
to the permeable parking stalls to capture and filter runoff that is not
infiltrated into the permeable paving. Curb alternatives allow for water to
access the swales and planters beyond.
   (B)   Drainage. All off-street parking areas shall have adequate grading and
drainage consistent with the Los Angeles County National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit and subject to the approval of the Community
Development Director.
   (C)   Dimensions.
      (1)   Standard space. Each standard parking space shall have minimum
dimensions of nine feet wide by 20 feet long.
      (2)   Compact space. Each compact car parking space shall have minimum
dimensions of eight feet wide by 15 feet long.
Each parking space shall be clearly marked by paint or some other easily
distinguishable material, and shall be maintained at all times.
   (D)   Screening. Through the review of development applications, the
Community Development Director or Planning Commission may require that a solid
masonry wall be provided along lot lines abutting parking areas to protect
adjacent properties and uses from adverse noise, light and glare, and similar
effects.
   (E)   Lighting. Parking area lighting shall be arranged to reflect away from
adjoining uses and to avoid creating nuisance effects on adjacent roadways.

   Landscaping of outdoor surface parking areas consisting of five or more
stalls shall be provided and maintained according to the general standards of
this section. The figures contained in this section are for illustrative
purposes only and do not imply that the concept illustrated be implemented
precisely as shown but rather in a manner consistent with the purpose of these
regulations.
   (A)   Landscape area required. A minimum of 8% of any parking lot area shall
be landscaped.
   (B)   Minimum planter dimension. No landscape planter that is to be counted
toward the required landscape area shall be less than five feet in any
horizontal dimension. The horizontal dimension is measured to the edge of the
landscaped area and does not include curbing.
   (C)   Layout. Landscaped areas shall be well-distributed throughout the
parking lot area. Parking lot should drain to the landscaped areas. Parking lot
landscaping may be provided in any combination of:
      (1)   Landscaped planting strips at least five feet wide between rows of
parking stalls;
      (2)   Landscaped planting strips between parking areas and adjacent
buildings or internal pedestrian walkways;
      (3)   A landscaped island at least five feet in all interior dimensions
and containing at least one 15-gallon-size or larger tree shall be provided at
each end of each interior row of parking stalls and between every six

§ 153.281 AREA.
   The minimum area for a Planned Development provisional plan, which does not
fully comply with the development standards of the underlying zone, shall be
one acre. Projects of less than one acre shall be subject to the procedures
contained in this subchapter, but shall not be eligible for consideration of

§ 153.282 PURPOSE.
   A Planned Development Zone may be established where:
   (A)   A proposal for a large-scale development (one acre or larger) makes it
desirable to apply regulations more flexible than those applicable to other
zones in this chapter;
   (B)   It has been determined that specific corridors within the city should
be designated as Planned Development Overlay Zones so as to insure the orderly
and compatible development of those identified corridors.

Development Overlay Zone (P-D) subject to the regulations set forth in this
subchapter. No person shall construct or maintain any building or structure for
use on any lot in a Planned Development Overlay Zone unless:

§ 153.284 PROVISIONAL PLANS.
   (A)   Where the city desires to specify corridors of the city for inclusion
as Planned Development Overlay Zones, such designation may be placed on the
properties after compliance with the procedure set forth in §§ 153.470 through
153.475 . In such cases of city-initiated zone changes to specify Planned
Development Overlay Zones, a precise plan shall be submitted by the applicant
at the time permission to build or remodel structures on property included in a
Planned Development Overlay Zone is sought. In city-initiated zone change cases
a provisional plan is not required.
   (B)   For large scale projects of over one acre in size, an application for
a change of classification to a Planned Development Overlay Zone (P-D) shall be
accompanied by a provisional plan showing the site purposed for the
development, the character and use of adjoining property, the general size,
location, and use of all proposed buildings and structures to be placed on the
site, and the location and dimensions of streets, parking areas, open areas,
and other public and private facilities and uses.

§ 153.285 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The change of classification shall be determined pursuant to the
procedure set forth in §§ 153.470 through 153.475, and the provisional plan,
where applicable, shall be merged with the Planned Development Overlay Zone (P-
D) for the particular property so classified. A provisional plan which does not
conform to the standard of development for the R, C, or M zones may be approved
for projects of one acre or larger when such plan fulfills the purposes of a
Planned Development Overlay Zone. A change in the provisional plan enacted with
a Planned Development Overlay Zone shall constitute a reclassification of the
property, and such change shall be determined pursuant to the procedure for
zoning amendments.
   (B)   No development of the subject site shall begin and no building permit
shall be issued for any property located in a Planned Development Overlay Zone
until a precise plan of development has been approved by the Planning
Commission and/or City Council as set forth in this subchapter. The precise
plan shall substantially conform to any provisional plan required by this
chapter.

within one year after the date the approval becomes final; provided, however,
if litigation is filed prior to the exercise of such rights attacking the

automatically extended pending a final determination of such litigation. The
granting body, upon good cause shown by the applicant, may extend the time
limitations imposed, once, for a period of not to exceed one year without a

   (H)   Modifications. Any condition imposed upon the approval of a precise
plan may be modified or eliminated, or new conditions may be added, provided
the granting body shall first conduct a public hearing thereon in the same
manner as is required for the granting of the same. No such modification shall
be made unless the granting body finds that such modification is necessary to
protect the public peace, health, and safety, or, in the event of the deletion
of such a condition, that such action is necessary to permit reasonable
development under the precise plan as approved. If the modification hearing is
conducted by the Commission, its decision shall be subject to review on appeal,
taken in the time and manner set forth in

§ 153.331(C)(7), the Planning Commission may, by resolution, deny said
application or grant such extension when, after hearing the testimony, or other

provisions would be unreasonable as to a particular sign; strict application of
the nonconforming sign provisions would create a hardship upon the applicant
which was not brought about by an act of the applicant; and the hardship
resulting from strict application of the nonconforming sign provisions
outweighs any detriment to the public caused by granting an extension of time.

recommended transit service or capital improvements which may be required as a
direct result of the project, and to recommend reasonable mitigation measures
minimizing automobile trips on the CMP network. It shall be the responsibility
of the transit operators to show the direct relation of the impacts to the
project and to show the reasonableness of proposed mitigation. Impacts and
recommended mitigation measures identified by the transit operator shall be
evaluated in the Draft Environmental Impact Report prepared for the project.
Related mitigation measures adopted shall be monitored through the mitigation
monitoring requirements of CEQA.
   (B)   Phased development projects, development projects subject to a
development agreement, or development projects requiring subsequent approvals,
need not repeat this process as long as no significant changes are made to the
project. It shall remain the discretion of the lead agency to determine when a
project is substantially the same and therefore covered by a previously
certified EIR.

equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act (the “Acts”) to request reasonable
accommodation in the application of the city’s land use regulations and to
establish relevant criteria to be used when considering such requests.
   (B)   Sections
153.484 through
153.490 are intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled
under the Acts.
   (C)   Sections
153.484 through

require the city to waiver or reduce development or building fees associated
with the granting of a reasonable accommodation request.
(Ord. 590-C.S., passed 3-1-11)
§ 153.485 SAME–APPLICABILITY.
   A request for reasonable accommodations may be made by any person with a
disability, their representative, or any entity, when the application of a

to fair housing opportunities.
(Ord. 590-C.S., passed 3-1-11)
§ 153.486 SAME–ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Requesting reasonable accommodation. A disabled person (or his or her
representative) who requests a reasonable accommodation in the form of a
modification in the application of a zoning requirement or prohibition that

disability of the applicant may do so by submitting a letter to the Community
Development Director and paying any fees. The letter shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   The applicant’s name, address, telephone number, and e-mail
address;
      (2)   Address of the property for which the request is being made;
      (3)   The current actual use of the property;

reasonable accommodation is being requested;
      (6)   Why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific
property accessible to the individual.
   (B)   If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable
accommodation, the Community Development Director will make every effort to
provide the assistance necessary to ensure that the process is accessible to
the applicant.
   (C)   If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is
being made also requires some other discretionary approval (including, but not
limited to, a conditional use permit, design review, general plan amendment,
zoning change, annexation, and the like), then the applicant shall file the
information required by this section together for concurrent review with the
application for discretionary approval.

§ 153.487 SAME–REVIEW AND DETERMINATION.
   (A)   The Community Development Director shall have the authority to
consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation. The Director may

applicant agreeing to comply with all other applicable zoning or building
regulations. The determination shall be made in writing. The determination
shall be based on the ability to make the required findings as set forth below.
   (B)   Rather than act on a request for reasonable accommodation, the
Community Development Director may refer the application to the Planning
Commission for consideration. The Planning Commission may approve,
conditionally approve, or deny a request. Approvals are subject to the
applicant agreeing to comply with all other applicable zoning or building
regulations. If the matter is referred to the Planning Commission, notice for a
public hearing shall be given as required by §
153.264 of this code. The determination shall be based on the ability to make
the required findings as set forth below.
   (C)   Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review
with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the
authority reviewing the discretionary land use application. The written
determination on whether to grant or deny the request for reasonable
accommodation shall be made by the authority responsible for reviewing the
discretionary land use application in compliance with the applicable review
procedure for the discretionary review. The determination shall be based on the
ability to make the required findings as set forth below.
(Ord. 590-C.S., passed 3-1-11)
§ 153.488 SAME–REQUIRED FINDINGS.
   (A)   The following findings must be analyzed, made and adopted before any
action is taken to approve, conditionally approve or deny a request for
reasonable accommodation, and must be incorporated into the record of the
proceeding relating to approval, conditional approval or denial:
      (1)   The housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by a
person with a disability as defined under the Acts:
      (2)   The request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make
specific housing available to a person with a disability as defined under the
Acts;
      (3)   The requested reasonable accommodation would not impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the city;
      (4)   The reasonable accommodation would not require a fundamental
alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to
land use and zoning;
      (5)   The impact on surrounding uses does not negatively impact the
public health, safety, and welfare;
      (6)   The physical attributes of and any proposed changes to the subject
property and structures are necessary and appropriate;

uses not otherwise allowed in a residential neighborhood, to the detriment of
the residential character of that neighborhood.
(Ord. 590-C.S., passed 3-1-11)
§ 153.489 SAME–CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.

authority may impose any conditions of or for approval deemed reasonable and
necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the
findings required by §
153.488.
   (B)   Conditions may be imposed to ensure that any removable structures or
physical design features that are constructed or installed in association with
the reasonable accommodation be removed once those structures or physical
design features are unnecessary to provide access to the dwelling unit for the
current occupants.

153.484 through
153.490 may be conditioned to provide for its rescission or automatic
expiration under appropriate circumstances.

§ 153.534 LANDSCAPE DESIGN PRINCIPLES.
   The following design principles are general standards to be used by city
staff and decision-makers in evaluating whether landscape plans conform to the
requirements of this section. The figures contained in this section are for
illustrative purposes only and do not imply that the concept illustrated be
implemented precisely as shown but rather in a manner consistent with the
purpose of these regulations:
   (A)   Natural landscapes. Landscape designs should incorporate, build upon
and complement existing natural landscapes using specimen trees, native
vegetation (including canopy, understory, and ground cover) as well as habitat.
Particular care should be given to preserve intact natural landscapes, if any.
   (B)   Responsive to local context and character. Landscape designs should
build on the site’s and area’s unique physical characteristics, conserving and
complementing existing natural features. Naturalistic design elements such as
irregular plant spacing, undulating berm contours, and mixed proportions of
plant species should be used to ensure that new landscaping blends in and
contributes to the quality of the surrounding area. Selection and spacing of
plant material should be reflective of the surrounding area’s character.
   (C)   Continuity and connection. Landscaping should be designed within the
context of the surrounding area, provided that the landscaping is also
consistent with these design principles. Where the design intent and the
surrounding landscape is naturalistic, plant materials should blend well with
adjacent properties, particularly where property edges meet, to create a
seamless and natural landscape. Where the design intent and the surrounding
landscape is formal, consistent or similar plant material and spacing should be
utilized. Exceptions should be made when seeking to create a transition between
uses and districts.
   (D)   Enhancing architecture. Landscape designs should be compatible with
and enhance the architectural character and features of the buildings on site,
and help relate the building to the surrounding landscape. Major landscape
elements should be designed to complement architectural elevations and
rooflines through color, texture, density, and form on both vertical and
horizontal planes. Landscaping should be in scale with on-site and adjacent
buildings. Plant material should be installed at an appropriate size and
allowed to accomplish these intended goals. When foundation planting is
required, plantings and window boxes should be compatible with a building’s
architectural character and could incorporate artistic elements.
   (E)   Composition. The quality of a landscape design is dependent not only
on the quantity and selection of plant materials but also on how that material
is arranged. Landscape materials should be arranged in a manner as to provide
the following qualities and characteristics:
      (1)   Texture. Landscape designs should provide a textured appearance
through the use of a variety of plant material rather than a single species.
Contrasting large leaf textures with medium and small leaf textures, and using
a variety of plant heights supports a natural aesthetic and provides more
ecological services. Spacing of key landscaping components, such as trees and
shrubs, should be consistent with the overall design approach of the landscape
plan. Formal landscape designs benefit from a uniform spacing of plants,
whereas varied spacing and clustering of trees is more compatible with a
naturalistic design.
      (2)   Scale. Landscape design should include plant material of an
appropriate scale to the space and/or structure(s) at their mature sizes.
Trees, shrubs, and hedges, especially those used for screening and buffering,
should display a fullness at maturity that is typical of the species.
      (3)   Color. Landscape designs should include a variety of plants to
provide contrasting color to other plants in the design. Designs are encouraged
to include flowering plants and especially a mix of plants that display
colorful flowers throughout the year and support local birds, butterflies and
pollinators. For ease of maintenance and water conservation, emphasis should be
placed on flowering perennials shrubs and not annual color.
      (4)   Form. Landscape designs should consider the complete three-
dimensional form of the landscape, not simply the form of individual elements.
The interrelationship of all landscape elements can be considered so that the
final design presents a coherent whole. Principles of feng shui or occidental
garden designs should be taken into consideration when planning the garden’s
form and design.
   (F)   Use of native and drought resistant plants. Landscape designs shall
feature native and/or related plant species, especially in areas adjacent to
existing native vegetation, to take advantage of the unique natural character
and diversity of the San Gabriel Valley and the adaptability of native plants
to local environmental conditions. Where feasible, the re-establishment of
native habitats should be incorporated into the landscape design. In the same
manner, landscape designs shall utilize drought tolerant plant materials to the
maximum extent feasible. The use of drought-tolerant plants should enrich the
existing landscape character, conserve water and energy, and provide a pleasant
and varied visual appearance as well as habitat for local wildlife.
   (G)   Buffering and screening. The placement of natural landscape materials
(trees, shrubs, and hedges) is the preferred method for buffering differing
land uses, for providing a transition between adjacent properties, and for
screening the view of any parking or storage area, trash enclosure, utility
enclosures, or other service area visible from a public street, alley, or
pedestrian area. Plants may be used with fences or berms to achieve the desired
screening or buffering effect. Plant material should be mature enough at the
time of planting to provide an effective buffer or screen, and should be
planted in an appropriate location to allow for desired growth within a
reasonable period of time. When used to screen an activity area such as a
parking lot, landscape shall not obstruct the visibility of motorists or
pedestrians or interfere with public safety.
   (H)   Sustainable practices. Sustainable stormwater management creates a
system of managing stormwater through retention, treatment or infiltration.
      (1)   Rainwater harvesting is the collection, storage and use of runoff
which is captured in a collection system such as a rain barrel or cistern.
   FIGURE 153.534-(H)(1): RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEM

IMAGES/0-0-0-6056.jpg]
 
      (2)   Permeable or porous paving allows rainfall and runoff to pass
through the paving into the ground below. Permeable paving allows for
infiltration, slows down runoff and improves water quality.

IMAGES/0-0-0-6058.jpg]
 
      (3)   Rain gardens are small depressed areas that allow water to pool for
a short amount of time and infiltrate into the ground. Rain gardens mimic
terrain commonly found in natural landscapes. Rain gardens help to slow down
runoff and improve water quality.

IMAGES/0-0-0-6060.jpg]
 
      (4)   Bioswales are shallow basins that use vegetation and soils to
filter, treat and infiltrate rainfall and runoff. Often used to capture runoff
from parking lots, bioswales can remove pollutants and sediments from runoff
water.

§ 153.535 AREAS TO BE LANDSCAPED.
   The following areas shall be landscaped, and may count toward the total area
of site landscaping required by zoning district regulations. The figures
contained in this section are for illustrative purposes only and do not imply
that the concept illustrated be implemented precisely as shown but rather in a
manner consistent with the purpose of these regulations.
   (A)   Required setbacks. All required setbacks in all zones, except for
areas used for exit and entry, shall be landscaped.
   (B)   Lot perimeters. Landscape buffers shall be installed and maintained
along side and rear lot lines between differing land uses, in accordance with
the following standards.
      (1)   Required landscape buffers. Table 153.535-(B)(1), Required
Landscape Buffers, shows when a buffer treatment is required, and of what type,
based on the proposed and the adjoining use. Only the proposed use is required
to provide the buffer yard. Adjoining uses are not required to provide the
buffer yard. The type of buffer yard required refers to buffer yard-type
designations as shown in Table 153.535-(B)(2), Buffer Yard Requirements. “-”

      (3)   Width reduction for adjacent landscaped buffer. If an equivalent
landscape buffer exists on the adjacent lot, the width of the required buffer
may be reduced 50% provided that the abutting property owners have provided a
written agreement ensuring the adjacent landscape buffer will be preserved and
maintained.
   (C)   Building perimeters. The portions of a multi-family residential,
commercial, industrial, or institutional building that front a public street
shall have one or more landscape planters installed along a minimum 20% of that

   (D)   Flood control channels. A 15-foot wide landscape buffer planted with
drought tolerant plants, including a 12-foot wide service road and bike path,
shall be provided along the outer edge of flood channel easements. In those
cases where a strict compliance with the landscaping requirements set forth in
this division may be a hardship on the property owner or the developer thereof,
an alternate plan accomplishing the objectives of helping restore the lost
environmental value of the Alhambra and Rubio washes and enhancing the washes
as scenic community amenities may be submitted for review by the Community
Development Director. The Community Development Director shall be authorized to
disapprove, approve, or conditionally approve the alternate plan.

   (E)   Parking areas. Parking areas as required by §
153.226, Parking Lot Landscaping and Screening.
   (F)   Parkways and street trees. Protect roots of street trees with
engineered soil and provide sufficient space for above and below ground growth.
Street trees form the canopy, provide shade, introduce seasonal color and
define the street edge. The minimum installed street tree size should be 24-
inch box to ensure long term survival of the tree and the ability for the tree
to reach mature height rapidly.
   (G)   Unused areas. All areas of a project site not intended for a specific
use, including areas planned for future phases of a phased development, shall
be landscaped or left in a natural state.
(Ord. 601-C.S., passed 3-4-14)
§ 153.536 MATERIALS.
   (A)   General. Landscaping may consist of a combination of groundcovers,
shrubs, vines, trees, and garden areas. Landscape may also include incidental
features such as stepping stones, benches, fountains, sculptures, decorative
stones, or other ornamental features, placed within a landscaped setting.
      (1)   Plants having similar water use shall be grouped together.
      (2)   Except for garden areas, plant materials shall be selected from
among those species and varieties known to thrive in the San Gabriel climate
and where applicable, selected from an approved list maintained by the city.
      (3)   Installation of invasive plant species is prohibited as listed on
the California Invasive Plant Council (Cal-IPC) list of Exotic Pest Plants of
Greatest Ecological Concern in California.
      (4)   Site drainage shall be directed toward landscaped areas wherever
feasible.
   (B)   Landscaped areas greater than 2,500 square feet. Where the total
landscape area is equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet for commercial,
industrial, and institutional projects or equal to or greater than 5,000 square
feet for single-family and multi-family residential projects, the following
landscape material limitations apply.
      (1)   Exclusive of garden areas, at least 60% of all plants and trees
must be native or low water use.
      (2)   A maximum of 25% of the required landscape areas shall be turf or
planted with other high water use plants except for turf areas that comprise an
essential component of a project (e.g., golf courses or playing fields), which
are exempt from this limit.
      (3)   The installation of turf on slopes greater than 25% is prohibited.
      (4)   No portion of turf areas shall be less than eight feet wide.
Landscaped areas less than ten feet wide shall be irrigated with sub-surface
drip or other technology that produces no over spray or runoff.
   (C)   Ground cover materials. Ground cover shall be of live plant material.
Groundcover may include grasses. Pervious non-plant materials such as permeable
paving, gravel, colored rock, cinder, bark, and similar materials shall not
cover more than 15% of the area required to be landscaped, except with approval
of a minor deviation to the landscape plan. Existing turf in residential zones
may be replaced with synthetic grass or artificial turf, subject to said
materials meeting design standards developed by the city. Mulch must be
confined to areas underneath shrubs and trees and is not a substitute for
ground cover plants.
   (D)   Mulch. A minimum two inch layer of mulch shall be applied on all
exposed soil surfaces of planting areas except in turf areas, creeping or
rooting ground covers or other special planting situations where mulch is not
recommended. Stabilizing mulching products shall be used on slopes.

the city’s cultural, architectural, social, historical, economic, and political
heritage. It is the intent and purpose of the San Gabriel City Council in
passing this subchapter to:
      (1)   Preserve, maintain, and safeguard the city’s heritage and
character, for the enjoyment of present and future generations, by providing
for the protection and thoughtful management of cultural resources as defined
in this subchapter;
      (2)   Foster awareness, recognition, and stewardship of the city’s
archaeological and Native American cultural resources;
      (3)   Encourage public knowledge and appreciation of the city’s heritage
and foster civic and neighborhood pride and sense of identity through the
recognition of cultural resources;
      (4)   Encourage the maintenance and preservation of cultural landscapes
that contribute to the historic character of our neighborhoods and built
environment;
      (5)   Recognize the city’s cultural resources as economic assets;
      (6)   Stabilize and improve property values within the city and increase
the economic and financial benefits to the city and its inhabitants through the
preservation, rehabilitation, and ongoing use of cultural resources;

CULTURAL RESOURCE SENSITIVITY MAP shall be subject to the provisions of the
federal Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470hh), which
requires that archaeological cultural resource site locations remain
confidential in order to ensure their preservation. The California Public
Records Act also provides for the nondisclosure of archaeological cultural
resource information (Cal. Gov’t Code § 6254.10).
   DEMOLITION. Any act or process that destroys, in whole or in part, a

Properties with HISTORIC INTEGRITY are those properties that retain enough of
their materials, features, and characteristics from their period of
significance that they continue to convey the reasons for their significance.
Often these are original materials that date from the property’s construction
or early period. As defined by the National Park Service and in accordance with
the accepted standards of professional preservation practice, HISTORIC
INTEGRITY is the composite of seven aspects of integrity: location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association. HISTORIC INTEGRITY is

   HISTORIC RESOURCE SURVEY. A neighborhood- or city-wide survey to identify
eligible cultural resources, including buildings, structures, objects, sites,
historic districts, planning features, public art and parks, cultural
landscapes, conservation overlay zones, and other features. A HISTORIC RESOURCE
SURVEY generally results in an inventory of properties that are potentially
eligible for national, state, or local landmark designation. The survey
produces basic information about each resource. This information generally
includes building type, dates of construction, architectural style, description
of other design aspects, materials, and setting, approximate dates of exterior
alterations, physical condition, and notes on historic integrity.
   HISTORIC RESOURCES.
      (1)   Those cultural resources that meet the significance criteria for
designation as historic landmarks itemized in §
153.607 or for historic districts itemized in §
153.608, including all the resources identified as “contributing” to a historic
district. HISTORIC RESOURCES in San Gabriel would include resources listed on
federal, state, and local registers, identified in the Inventory, or properties
that have not yet been evaluated but which evidence shows would satisfy the
designation criteria. Generally, the term HISTORIC RESOURCE does not include
paleontological resources.
      (2)   HISTORICAL RESOURCES are defined pursuant to CEQA as resources
listed in, or formally determined eligible for listing in, the California
Register of Historical Resources; resources listed in the local, San Gabriel

historically appropriate. Completion of the INITIAL REVIEW will result in a
finding that the proposed changes are in accordance with the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and other
applicable design guidelines provided for in this subchapter and will result in
no significant adverse impacts to the cultural resource.
   INITIAL REVIEW ADMINISTRATIVE CLEARANCE. The review completed by city staff,
at the administrative level, finding that an application for a minor alteration
to a cultural resource is historically appropriate and in accordance with the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties
and other applicable design guidelines provided for in this subchapter and will
result in no significant adverse impacts to cultural resources.
   MAJOR ALTERATIONS. Any work to a property that includes the alteration,
removal, or obstruction of character-defining features, elevations, and spaces,
or additions to a property that are visible from the public right-of-way, or,

§ 153.605 SAN GABRIEL INVENTORY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES.
   (A)   Purpose. The Cultural Resources Chapter of the General Plan includes
goals and targets intended to identify and protect San Gabriel’s cultural
resources. Target 11.4.2 specifies the creation of an inventory of “San
Gabriel’s cultural resources and landscapes.” This section furthers this goal
by creating the San Gabriel Inventory of Cultural Resources (Inventory).
   (B)   Intent. This section establishes the process for creating and managing
the Inventory, which is the city’s list of potentially eligible cultural
resources.
   (C)   Inventory of cultural resources established. The city shall create and
maintain an official list of properties known as the San Gabriel Inventory of
Cultural Resources (“Inventory”). The Inventory shall be a list of potentially
eligible cultural resources identified through a historic resource survey. The
historic resource survey creating the Inventory shall be completed under the
direction of the Director and Commission by a qualified architectural historian
or historian as defined in this subchapter, in accordance with accepted
professional practices. Prior to commencement of a historic resource survey,
the city shall commission the preparation of a citywide historic context
statement, in order to identify significant themes and patterns of development
and to develop a consistent framework for survey work and evaluations.
   (D)   Inventory creation, review, and adoption. Within the first year of its
establishment, the Commission shall forward a plan to the City Council
recommending a comprehensive and systematic historic resource survey, which
will provide the basis for the Inventory. The Inventory shall be reviewed and
approved by the Commission. The Commission shall then refer the Inventory to
the City Council for discussion and approval. The Commission shall compile and
maintain the Inventory of Cultural Resources.
   (E)   Inventory updates. In accordance with the purpose of this subchapter
and to ensure the city’s proactive identification and treatment of cultural
resources, and consistent with the intent of Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 5024.1.g(4),
the Inventory shall be reviewed at minimum every five years and periodically
updated through historic resource surveys.
   (F)   Inventory notification. All owners and residents of properties
included on the Inventory shall be notified by the city of this inclusion, in a
process and timeline to be determined by the Director. In order to ensure that
owners, residents, and potential owners are aware of the status of cultural
resources, the Director and Building and Safety Division shall implement and
oversee a system for clearly identifying and marking the building records of
all Inventory-listed properties, including but not limited to a geographic
information systems (GIS) database.
   (G)   Inventory of cultural resources and CEQA. In accordance with
California Code of Regulations Title 14, Chapter 3, § 15064.5(a)(2), properties
included on the Inventory of Cultural Resources shall be considered historical
resources for purposes of CEQA.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.606 SAN GABRIEL REGISTER OF CULTURAL RESOURCES.
   (A)   Purpose. The Cultural Resources Chapter of the General Plan includes
goals and targets aimed at identifying, conserving, and protecting San
Gabriel’s cultural resources. The creation of the San Gabriel Register of
Cultural Resources (Register) forwards the goals of the General Plan.
   (B)   Intent. This section establishes the process for creating and managing
the Register, which is the city’s list of officially designated cultural
resources.
   (C)   Register of cultural resources established. There is hereby
established the San Gabriel Register of Cultural Resources (“Register”). The
Register shall include all locally designated cultural resources, as well as
properties designated on the National Register of Historic Places and
California Register of Historical Resources. The Register is also understood to
include all contributors to designated historic districts in addition to
individually designated properties. The most current iteration of the Register
shall be made available on the city’s website and will be included in the
city’s GIS database.
   (D)    Reserved.
   (E)   Prior local designations. Any property designated as a culturally
significant landmark or as a historic landmark by the City Council on or before
the effective date of this subchapter shall be automatically designated as a
cultural resource for purposes of this subchapter and included on the Register.
Any historic property under a Mills Act contract at the time of the adoption of
this subchapter shall also be automatically added to the Register.
   (F)   New designations. New designations of cultural resources shall be
initiated in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in this
subchapter.
   (G)   Designation runs with the land. The designation of a cultural resource
shall not be affected by a change of the property owner.
   (H)   Rescission of designation. The conditions and process for amendment or
rescission of a cultural resource designation are described in §
153.612 (Amendment or Rescission of Designation).

§ 153.607 DESIGNATION CRITERIA FOR HISTORIC LANDMARKS.
   With the advice of the Commission, the City Council may designate a
property, site, public art, park, cultural landscape, or natural feature as a
historic landmark and add it to the San Gabriel Register if it meets the
requirements described in divisions (A) and (B) below:
   (A)   The property meets one of the following eligibility criteria:
      (1)   It is or was once associated or identified with important events or
broad patterns of development that have made a significant contribution to the
cultural, architectural, social, historical, economic, and political heritage
of the city, region, state, or nation.
      (2)   It is or was once associated with an important person or persons
who made a significant contribution to the history, development, and/or culture
of the city, region, state, or nation.
      (3)   It embodies the distinctive characteristics of a style, type,
period, or method of construction; represents the work of a master, or
possesses high artistic or aesthetic values; or it represents one of the last,
best remaining examples of an architectural type or style in a neighborhood or
the city that was once common but is increasingly rare.
      (4)   It has yielded or has the potential to yield information important
to the prehistory or history of the city, region, state, or nation.
   (B)   The property retains integrity from its period of significance, as
determined by a qualified architectural historian or historian. A proposed
historic landmark need not retain all seven aspects of historic integrity
(location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association),
but it must retain sufficient integrity to convey the reasons for its cultural,
architectural, social, historical, economic, and political significance.
   (C)   Neither the deferred maintenance of a proposed historic landmark nor
its dilapidated condition shall, on its own, be equated with a loss of
integrity. Integrity shall be judged with reference to the particular
characteristics that support the property’s eligibility under the appropriate
criteria and theme of significance.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.608 DESIGNATION CRITERIA FOR HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   In addition to satisfying the criteria in §
153.607(A) when recommending the designation of a historic district, the
Commission and City Council must also find:
      (1)   That the historic district is an identifiable and distinct entity
with discernible boundaries, consisting of a cohesive concentration, linkage,
or continuity of sites, buildings, structures or objects united historically or
aesthetically by plan or physical development.
      (2)   That the historic district retains integrity from its period of
significance as determined by a qualified architectural historian or historian.
Not all properties or features within a proposed district need to retain all
seven aspects of integrity (location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association), but a substantial number of such properties and
structures must retain sufficient integrity to convey the historic, cultural,
or architectural significance of the district.
      (3)   That a minimum of 51% of the buildings and structures within the
boundaries of the historic district be identified as contributors to the
historic district.
   (B)   The components of an eligible historic district may lack individual
distinction but still represent a significant and distinguishable entity that
meets eligibility criteria.
   (C)   In recommending approval of a historic district, the Commission shall
recommend the adoption of district-specific preservation plan and design
guidelines to guide subsequent in-fill and new construction, alterations and
additions, and to further the purpose of this subchapter.
   (D)   Neither deferred maintenance within a proposed district nor the
dilapidated condition of its constituent buildings and landscapes shall, on its
own, be equated with a loss of integrity. Integrity shall be judged with
reference to the particular characteristics that support the district’s
eligibility under the appropriate criteria and theme of significance.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.609 DESIGNATION PROCEDURES–HISTORIC LANDMARKS.
   (A)   Application.   The Historic Preservation and Cultural Resource

review of a designation application, to confirm the finding of eligibility.
Such an assessment shall be submitted to the Commission for review and
concurrence. The assessment shall be completed by a qualified architectural
historian or historian as defined in this subchapter.
   (E)   Commission review and recommendation. The Commission shall review and
conduct a public hearing on the merits of the application, to determine whether

(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.611 CONSERVATION OVERLAY ZONES–CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Purpose. The Cultural Resources Chapter of the General Plan includes a
number of goals and targets intended to identify, conserve, and protect the
historic character of the city’s neighborhoods. Allowing for the identification
and adoption of conservation overlay zones forwards General Plan goals and
targets.
   (B)   Intent. This section establishes the criteria and process for
identifying and adopting conservation overlay zones.
   (C)   Definition. CONSERVATION OVERLAY ZONES are cohesive groupings of
related properties that convey an era or type of construction in the city’s
history but do not qualify for designation as historic districts. This
subchapter provides for the identification and management of such CONSERVATION
OVERLAY ZONES. Alterations to properties and features found to be contributing
elements of CONSERVATION OVERLAY ZONES shall be subject to design guidelines
and standards as adopted by the Commission. For purposes of CEQA, CONSERVATION
OVERLAY ZONES are not historical resources.
   (D)   Procedures. As verified by a qualified architectural historian or
historian through a historic resource survey or evaluation, the Commission may
recommend that the City Council approve the creation of a conservation overlay
zone if the proposed zone meets one of the following criteria:
      (1)   It represents a grouping of properties and features with a cohesive
and identifiable setting, architectural style, scale, or character, and/or
development history or association that makes it an integral part of the city’s
identity; or
      (2)   It represents a recognized neighborhood identity with a definable
physical character whose retention would contribute to the historic character
and setting of the city.
   (E)   Design guidelines. The adoption of a conservation overlay zone shall
be accompanied, within a timely manner, by the adoption of design guidelines to
guide new construction/in-fill, major alterations, and additions within the
boundaries of the conservation overlay zone. The design guidelines shall
reference the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards, particularly with
reference to the mass and scale of new construction/infill, major alterations,
and additions, interpreted with the flexibility appropriate to a conservation
overlay zone.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.612 AMENDMENT OR RESCISSION OF DESIGNATION.
   (A)   Criteria for rescission. Once a cultural resource has been designated,
it shall not be repealed by the City Council unless the City Council first
determines that: (1) the evidence used to establish the designation was
erroneous; or (2) the cultural resource no longer meets the criteria for
designation established in §§
153.607 and
153.608 of this subchapter.
   (B)   Amendment or rescission. The City Council may initiate an amendment or
rescission of the designation of any designated cultural resource in the same
manner that is followed for designation. This process shall be considered a
discretionary action under CEQA.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.613 DUTY TO MAINTAIN DESIGNATED CULTURAL RESOURCES.
   (A)   Purpose. The owner, or other person in charge, of a cultural resource
listed on the Register has a duty to maintain in good repair all exterior
features and to comply with all applicable codes, laws, and regulations
governing the maintenance of the cultural resource. It is the intent of this
section to preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect the exterior
features of cultural resources and the interior portions thereof when such
maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of the exterior.
Cultural resources listed on the Register shall be protected against such decay
and deterioration and shall remain free from structural defects through prompt
corrections of any of the following defects:
      (1)   Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations or other vertical
supports that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing or buckling;
      (2)   Deterioration of flooring or floor supports or other horizontal
members that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing or buckling;
      (3)   Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning, sagging,
splitting, listing or buckling;
      (4)   Deterioration of crumbling exterior plasters or mortars;
      (5)   Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations
including broken windows and doors;
      (6)   Defective protection or lack of weather protection for exterior
walls and roof coverings, including through the lack of paint or other
protective covering;
      (7)   Rotting holes or other forms of decay;
      (8)   Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and
door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings, ornament, trim and other
architectural details that cause delamination, instability, loss of shape and
form and crumbling.
   (B)   Enforcement procedures.
      (1)   The Director may file a petition listing specific defects with the
Neighborhood Improvement Services Manager, or person whom the Director has
designated to act in that capacity, requesting the correction of defects and/or
repairs to designated properties.
      (2)   Whenever such a petition is filed, the Neighborhood Improvement
Services Manager or the Director’s designee shall attempt to make direct
personal contact with the owner or other such person having legal possession or
custody and/or representative. If personal contact is not possible, then
written notification of the specific defects and a right to inspect the
property will be mailed to the owner or such person having legal possession,
custody and/or control and posted at a conspicuous location appropriate to the
identified defects. In the written notification, the Neighborhood Improvement
Services Manager or the Director’s designee shall document the nature of the
specific defects and corrective action ordered.
      (3)   After receiving agreement from the owner, representative or other
such persons having legal possession, custody and control of the property for
an inspection, the Neighborhood Improvement Services Manager or the Director’s
designee and the Director or his or her designee shall conduct an investigation
and prepare a written report on whether the property requires work to meet the
requirements of division (A) set forth above.
      (4)   If the property is found to require work to meet the requirements
of division (A) above, the owner, representative or such persons having legal
possession, custody and control of the property will be served within 15 days
with a complaint identifying the deficiencies and providing notice that a
hearing will be held before the Commission at their next available agenda. The
purpose of the hearing shall be to:
         (a)   Receive evidence about the deteriorated conditions;
         (b)   Develop a plan and schedule for undertaking the needed repairs
to stabilize the building or structure and arrest further deterioration.
      (5)   Following such notice and hearing a written determination as to the
conditions in need of correction/repair will be prepared, and the owner or
other interested parties will be served with an order to repair those defective
elements within a reasonable specified time frame.
      (6)   If the owner fails to make the necessary repairs within the
identified time frame, the city may utilize any available remedy at law to
correct the deficiencies that create any hazardous and/or unsafe conditions to
life, health, or property. The expense of this work can be recorded as a lien
on the property.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.614 INITIAL REVIEW–REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Purpose. No person shall carry out or cause to be carried out any
alteration or relocation of a property listed on the Register unless the city

§ 153.616 INITIAL REVIEW, ADMINISTRATIVE CLEARANCE FOR MINOR
ALTERATIONS–FINDINGS.
   The following considerations shall guide the initial review administrative
clearance for historic appropriateness.
   (A)   The Director or his or her designee may approve or approve with
conditions an initial review administrative clearance for historic
appropriateness for minor alterations to cultural resources listed on the
Register that:
      (1)   Are compatible with the historic character and scale of the
cultural resource, including its size, massing, proportions, orientation,
architectural details, and the spatial relationships that characterize the
property and its site;
      (2)   Do not result in a change of design, material, or appearance of the
property’s character-defining features (except those changes determined to be
in compliance with the Secretary’s Standards, per division (A)(3) below;
      (3)   Comply with the Secretary’s Standards and any other applicable
design guidelines adopted by the city;
      (4)   Will not cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of

      (6)   Are consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   In accordance with CEQA, a project that has been determined to conform
with the Secretary’s Standards is generally considered to be a project that
will not cause a significant adverse impact to a historical resource, pursuant
to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, § 15126.4(b)(1). Projects that
comply with the Secretary’s Standards may be exempt from further review under
CEQA, pursuant to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, § 15331.
   (C)   No changes shall be made to approved plans for which an initial review
administrative clearance for historic appropriateness has been completed
without resubmitting the revised plans to the Director or his or her designee
for review and approval.
   (D)   All initial reviews completed in accordance with this section shall
expire one year from the date of effectiveness unless work is started within
that time.
   (E)   If the Director or his or her designee determines that proposed work
involving a cultural resource could result in a change of design, material, or
appearance of character-defining features or could have the potential to
conflict with the Secretary’s Standards, the Director or his or her designee
may refer the project and the initial review to the Commission.

         (c)   Comply with the Secretary’s Standards and any other applicable
design guidelines adopted by the city and therefore are either mitigated to a
less-than-significant impact on historical resources under CEQA (CEQA
Guidelines [California Code of Regulations. Title 14] § 15064.5(b)(3)) or
exempt from CEQA under Class 31, which applies to “projects limited to
maintenance, repair, stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation,
conservation or reconstruction of historical resources in a manner consistent
with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic
Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and

review.
      (3)   All initial reviews completed in accordance with this section shall
expire one year from the date of effectiveness unless work is started within
that time.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.619 SAN GABRIEL INVENTORY AND THE INITIAL REVIEW–REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Purpose. No person shall carry out or cause to be carried out any
major alteration or relocation of a potential cultural resource listed on the
Inventory unless the city has first completed an initial review in accordance
with the requirements of this subchapter. The approval or denial of the
proposed work involving Inventory-listed cultural resources shall be deemed a
discretionary action under CEQA (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, §
15002(i).
   (B)   Actions requiring an initial review. The following actions shall
require an initial review from the Director or his or her designee. The
Director may refer some initial reviews for Inventory resources to the
Commission for action. Performance of any work that falls within the provisions
of this subchapter without an initial review is prohibited.
      (1)   Major alterations or relocation of a cultural resource listed on
the Inventory;
      (2)   New construction within a historic district listed on the
Inventory;
   (C)   The Director shall develop procedures and findings associated with the
completion of an initial review for Inventory properties.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.620 RELOCATION OF DESIGNATED CULTURAL RESOURCES.
   (A)   Purpose. Relocation has the potential to adversely affect the
significance of cultural resources and is discouraged. Should relocation of a
Register-listed cultural resource be necessary, this section outlines the
process and criteria for issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for
relocation.
   (B)   Procedure. The Director or his or her designee shall review
applications for relocating Register-listed cultural resources. At the
discretion of the Director, relocation applications can be submitted to the
Commission for review.
   (C)   Criteria for relocation. Relocation shall be permitted only when
relocation is consistent with the goals and policies of the General Plan, this
subchapter, and applicable area or specific plans, and only when all of the
following findings can be made by the Director or Commission:
      (1)   Relocation will not significantly change, destroy, or adversely
affect the historic integrity of the cultural resource;
      (2)   Relocation will not have a significant adverse effect on the
character of the historic district or neighborhood, or surrounding properties
where the cultural resource is located or at the location of its receiver site;
      (3)   The original site and the proposed receiver site are controlled
through ownership, long-term lease, or similar assurance by the person(s)
proposing relocation, to the Commission’s approval; and
      (4)   The relocation is necessary to correct an unsafe or dangerous
condition on the site and no other measures for correcting the condition have
been determined feasible, or the relocation is necessary to preserve the
cultural resource and all other feasible options for preservation on the
original site have failed, as determined by the Director or Commission.
   (D)   Relocation timing. The cultural resource shall not be relocated until
all appropriate entitlements have been obtained.
   (E)   Relocation plan. Relocations shall follow a plan approved by the
Commission or Director and include the following:
      (1)   Application for relocation shall be made on a form provided by the
Director.
      (2)   The Commission shall hold a noticed public hearing and make a

(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.621 CERTIFICATE OF DEMOLITION.
   (A)   Purpose. This section describes the process for obtaining a
certificate of demolition for any property listed on the Register or Inventory.
No permit shall be issued by the city or staff designee to demolish a property
included on the Register or Inventory without first obtaining a certificate of
demolition. The approval or denial of the certificate of demolition shall be
deemed a discretionary action under CEQA (California Code of Regulations, Title
14, § 15002(i)). Penalties for noncompliance with the provisions of this
subchapter are described in §
153.629 (Enforcement and Penalties).
   (B)   Intent. It is the intent of the city that cultural resources will not
be demolished unless extraordinary circumstances exist. In keeping with the
purpose of the General Plan and this subchapter, cultural resources merit
protection in order to encourage their retention for the benefit and enjoyment
of current and future generations. The following provisions are intended to
establish reasonable measures to ensure that cultural resources are not
inadvertently or unnecessarily destroyed and that all feasible alternatives to
their demolition are explored.
   (C)   Compliance with federal and state laws. Review of all applications for
a certificate of demolition shall comply with applicable state and federal laws
and regulations, including without limitation, CEQA, the National Historic
Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.
   (D)   Application materials. All applications for a certificate of
demolition will include:
      (1)   The demolition permit application, on a form prescribed by the
Director;
      (2)   If the cultural resource has been determined an imminent hazard,
documentation from the Director, including documentation from a qualified
structural engineer, as defined in §
153.603 (Definitions), describing the basis for this determination;
      (3)   If the cultural resource has been determined to no longer meet the
criteria for eligibility, documentation from a qualified architectural
historian or historian as defined in §
153.603 (Definitions), describing the basis for this determination;
      (4)   Other materials as requested by the Director. Such materials may
include (but not be limited to) current photographs of the resource(s) for
which the certificate of demolition is requested; a plot plan identifying the
resource(s) proposed for demolition and any other buildings, structures or
historic features on the property; and documentation of any claims by the
applicant regarding the condition or costs for repair of the resource.
   (E)   One hundred eighty-day waiting period. For any cultural resource not
deemed an imminent hazard, the Director and/or Commission may delay demolition
for a period of up to but not exceeding 180 days. During this period, the
Commission and Director shall work with the property owner to explore
alternatives to demolition, including adaptive re-use and/or rehabilitation in
accordance with the Secretary’s Standards, application of the California
Historical Building Code to allow for flexibility in code requirements in cases
of adaptive reuse or rehabilitation, use of financial incentives such as the
Mills Act historic property contract program, relocation, resale, or other
provisions as appropriate.
   (F)   Procedure.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for demolition, a notice of intent
to demolish, on a form approved by the Director, shall be prominently posted on
the property.
      (2)   The Director or his or her designee shall review the application
for demolition and confirm that all requested materials have been provided.
Once deemed complete, the application will be scheduled for the next available
Commission meeting.
      (3)   If the cultural resource proposed for demolition has been
determined to be an imminent threat to public health, safety, and welfare by
the City Building Official, the Director or his or her designee may approve or
deny the request.
      (4)   All projects requiring a certificate of demolition shall require
public notification. The city shall, no later than ten days prior to the
hearing, issue a public hearing notice indicating the place, date, and time of
the Commission meeting and include a brief description of the proposed project.
Public notification shall be provided as follows:
         (a)   Hearing notice to applicant and owners. Public notification
shall be provided to the applicant, to all owners of real property as shown on
the county’s latest equalized assessment roll, and to all legal occupants
located within a 300-foot radius of the subject parcel upon which a certificate
is requested.
         (b)   Hearing notice to owners of historic district properties. Public
notification for any project proposed within a locally designated historic
district or a district listed on the California Register shall be as follows:
the public notification described in division (F)(4)(a) above, plus the owners
of real property as shown on the county’s latest equalized assessment roll and
to all legal occupants of each property located within the historic district.
      (5)   The Commission shall review the application, staff report, and hear
evidence presented by property owners and members of the public to determine if
the criteria for demolition approval have been met. The Commission shall
approve, deny, delay the demolition for a specified period, approve with
conditions, or continue the application to obtain additional information
necessary to consider the demolition request.
      (6)   If the demolition request is denied because it does not meet the
aforementioned criteria, the applicant may request demolition approval based on
a finding of economic hardship in accordance with §
153.623 of this subchapter;
      (7)   If the demolition request is denied, the owner or applicant may
appeal the Commission’s decision in writing to the City Council within ten days
of the Commission’s decision in accordance with §
153.626 of this subchapter.
      (8)   If a certificate of demolition approval is granted on any basis
other than that of imminent hazard to public safety or economic hardship, the
city will not issue a certificate of demolition approval until (1) Historic
American Buildings Survey (HABS) or Historic American Engineering Report (HAER)
documentation of the resource slated for demolition and its setting have been
completed by a qualified architectural historian, historian, or historic
architect as defined in this subchapter and (2) plans for the replacement
structure have been approved by the Commission. The replacement plan must be in
compliance with existing zoning, the city’s General Plan, any adopted
neighborhood or specific plan for the area and applicable design guidelines.
Vacant land or non-use will not constitute a valid replacement plan.
      (9)   The Director or his or her designee will analyze the replacement
plan for its conformance with the Secretary’s Standards and other city-level
design guidelines as applicable and will prepare a report with recommendations.
         (a)   The Commission will review the replacement plan and make a
decision to approve, deny, approve with conditions or continue the matter with
specific instructions as to what information is needed to make a decision on
the request.
         (b)   If the replacement plan is denied, the owner or applicant may
appeal the decision of the Commission in writing to the City Council within ten
days of the decision. The City Council will hear the appeal according to §
153.626 of this subchapter.
   (G)   Mandatory findings. The city shall not issue a certificate of
demolition for a cultural resource listed on the Register or Inventory unless
the applicant has met all of the following conditions:
      (1)   The 180-day waiting period or other period of up to 180 days as
required by the Commission has expired and all steps to explore alternatives to
demolition, as described in §
153.621(E) have been explored to the Commission’s satisfaction;
      (2)   Any deterioration of the cultural resource is not the result of the
failure of the owner to maintain the property in accordance with §
153.613 of this subchapter;
      (3)   As a condition of approval, all permits have been granted for the
replacement structure;
      (4)   CEQA analysis has been conducted, and the owner has provided
substantial evidence, as defined in CEQA (Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(e)),
demonstrating that no feasible alternative exists that would avoid a
significant adverse impact to the cultural resource.
   (H)   Proposed demolition of properties 45 years old or older.
      (1)   Purpose. The Cultural Resources Chapter of the General Plan
includes goals and targets intended to diminish “imminent threats to San
Gabriel’s heritage” (Goal 11.4). Specifically, Target 11.4.1 specifies the
creation of an ordinance that “provides protection against demolition.” This
provision forwards this General Plan goal.
      (2)   Intent. This section shall diminish imminent threats to properties
that qualify as cultural resources but have not been subject to evaluation. The
section describes the circumstances in which the Director or his or her
designee shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a historic resources
assessment of any property proposed for demolition that is 45 years of age or
older but not included on the Register or Inventory.
      (3)   Applicability. If a permit is sought to demolish a property that
was constructed at least 45 years prior to the date of application for
demolition, the application shall be referred to the Director to make a
preliminary determination as to whether the property meets national, state, or
local criteria for designation, if the property:
         (a)   Is not already listed on the Register or Inventory;
         (b)   Is not the subject of a pending landmark nomination for the
Register, either individually or as a contributor to a historic district.
      (4)   Exception, properties within recently surveyed areas. If the
property proposed for demolition falls within an area of the city that was
subject to a historic resource survey approved and adopted by the City Council
within the last five years, and the property was not identified as a potential
cultural resource, a historic resources assessment will not be required.
      (5)   Determination by Director.
         (a)   Time limit and criteria. Within a timely manner from receipt of
an application to demolish a property under division (H) below, the Director or
his or her designee will obtain a professional opinion from a qualified
architectural historian or historian as defined in §
153.603 (Definitions) of this subchapter as to whether the property is
potentially eligible for federal, state, or local listing. If the Director
determines that the property is potentially eligible at the federal, state, or
local level, he or she shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, with assistance
from a qualified architectural historian or historian as defined in §
153.603 (Definitions) of this subchapter, an intensive-level historic resources
evaluation (HRE) following practices promulgated by the State Office of
Historic Preservation.
         (b)   Notice. The Director shall notify the property owner of the
determination of the HRE in writing within a timely manner. Failure of the
Director to act within 60 days shall be considered a determination that the
property is not eligible for listing at the federal, state, or local level.
         (c)   Determination and effect.
            1.   If, based on a negative finding of the HRE, the Director
determines that the property is not eligible at the federal, state, or local
level, the permit to demolish the property shall be issued without further
restrictions under this subchapter.
            2.   If, based on a finding of the HRE, the Director determines
that the property is potentially eligible at the federal, state, or local
level, the Director shall schedule consideration of the HRE on the next
available agenda of the Commission. Following review of the HRE and concurrence
by the Commission, the property shall be added to the Inventory and the
provisions of §
153.621 shall apply to the proposed demolition.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.622 WORK HOLD PENDING DESIGNATION.
   (A)   Work hold–pending historic landmark designation. Except as necessary
to correct an unsafe or dangerous condition pursuant to §
153.624, it shall be unlawful for any person to carry out or cause to be
carried out any activity requiring an initial review on a proposed cultural
resource for which an application has been filed, until final approval of the
designation. An exception to the work hold shall apply for alterations shown to
comply with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties, as found through the project review process and criteria
established in this subchapter.
   (B)   Work hold–pending historic district designation. Except as necessary
to correct an unsafe or dangerous condition pursuant to §
153.624, it shall be unlawful for any person to carry out or cause to be
carried out any activity requiring an initial review for any property within
the boundaries of a proposed historic district while an application for
designation is pending. An exception to the temporary moratorium shall apply
for alterations shown to comply with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for the Treatment of Historic Properties, as found through the project review
process and criteria established in this subchapter.
(Ord. 636-C.S., passed 8-15-17)
§ 153.623 CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   (A)   Purpose. The city recognizes that there may be circumstances in which
the provisions of this subchapter could create an undue economic hardship. This
section describes the criteria and process for property owners to demonstrate
that such a hardship exists. The City Council may issue a certificate of
economic hardship to allow alteration or demolition of a cultural resource
listed on the Register or Inventory where denial of the same would create an
undue economic hardship upon the owner.
   (B)   Threshold. For income-producing properties, the threshold for
establishing economic hardship shall be that a reasonable rate of return cannot
be obtained from the property in its present condition or if rehabilitated. For
non-income-producing properties, the threshold for establishing economic
hardship shall be that, without approval of the proposed demolition or remodel,
the property owner would be deprived of all reasonable use of or return from
the property. For proposed demolition, the commission must make the finding
that the cultural resource cannot be remodeled or rehabilitated in a manner
that would allow for a reasonable use of or return from the property.
   (C)   Applications. An application for a certificate of economic hardship
shall be subject to a pro forma evaluation completed for the city by a
qualified economic professional selected from a list of qualified economic
professionals to be maintained by the city. The application shall be made on
the prescribed form and be accompanied by the following information. The
following would be applicable, unless the Director makes the written
determination that such information is not required:
      (1)   The estimated market value of the property in its current condition
with supporting documentation.
      (2)   The estimated market value of the property after completion of the
proposed alteration or demolition with supporting documentation.

supporting documentation.
      (4)   In the case of demolition, the estimated market value of the
property after renovation of the existing property for continued use and an
estimate from a qualified historic architect as defined in §
153.603 (Definitions) as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse
of the existing structure on the property.
      (5)   A rehabilitation report from a qualified structural engineer or
historic architect as defined in §
153.603 (Definitions) of this subchapter as to the structural condition of the
property and feasibility of stabilization and rehabilitation.
      (6)   For income-producing properties, information on annual gross
income, operating and maintenance expenses, tax deductions for depreciation,
and annual cash flow after debt service, current property value appraisals,
assessed property valuations, and real estate taxes.
      (7)   Remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing secured by the
property and annual debt service, if any, for the previous two years.
      (8)   All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner
or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing, or ownership of the
property.
      (9)   The amount paid for the property if purchased within the previous
36 months, the date of purchase, and the party from whom purchased, including a

financing between the seller and buyer.
      (10)   Any listing of the property for sale, rent, prices asked, and
offers received, if any within the previous two years.
      (11)   Any other information the Director may reasonably require in order
to determine whether or not the property may yield a reasonable return to the
owners.
   (F)   Hearing required. The City Council shall hold a public hearing on all
applications for a certificate of economic hardship; after which it may
approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application. Such hearing may be
held concurrently with any related application for an initial review or
certificate of demolition.
   (G)   Findings. The City Council shall approve a certificate of economic
hardship if it makes all of the following findings:
      (1)   Denial of the application would decrease the value of the subject
property so as to deprive the owner of any reasonable economic return on the
property.
      (2)   Sale or rental of the property is not financially feasible, when
looking at the cost of holding such property for uses permitted in the
applicable zone.
      (3)   Adaptive reuse of the property for lawful purposes is prohibited or
impractical.
      (4)   Denial of the application would damage the owner of the property
unreasonably in comparison to the benefit conferred on the community.
   (H)   Approval.
      (1)   Upon approval, copies of the certificate of economic hardship shall

§ 153.624 UNSAFE OR DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.
   (A)   None of the provisions of this subchapter shall be construed to
prevent any construction, alteration, removal, demolition or relocation of a
historic landmark or contributing resource necessary to correct the unsafe or
dangerous conditions of any structure, or feature, or part thereof, where the
Building Official, with a report from a qualified structural engineer or other
qualified professional, has declared such condition unsafe or dangerous and the
proposed construction, alteration, removal, demolition or relocation necessary
to correct the condition. Only such work as is necessary to correct the unsafe
or dangerous condition may be performed pursuant to this section. All
assessments shall utilize the California Historical Building Code and the
Uniform Code for Building Conservation.
   (B)   The Building Official shall inform the Commission and Director prior
to authorizing any work pursuant to this subchapter unless he or she determines
that such work is immediately necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous
condition; in which case, the Building Official shall report his or her actions
to the Director within 48 hours and to the Commission at its next regular
meeting.
   (C)   If work authorized by the Building Official pursuant to this
subchapter is not immediately necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous
condition, the Commission may advise the Building Official of the historic
significance of the building and recommend a reasonable period of postponement
for the purpose of arranging for rehabilitation, relocation, documentation,
and/or salvage of the cultural resource or contributing resource.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no arrangements have been made for
rehabilitation, relocation, or salvage within 60 days of an order to abate a
nuisance, or an earlier time if determined to be necessary by the Building
Official, the Building Official may proceed with the abatement action.

§ 153.627 PRESERVATION INCENTIVES.
   (A)   Purpose. The City Council may by resolution or ordinance adopt
preservation incentives to encourage the designation, preservation,
maintenance, and appropriate rehabilitation of the city’s cultural resources.
Preservation incentives, in the form of financial and regulatory incentives,
shall be made available to owners of properties that are designated cultural
resources, either individually or as contributors to historic districts, and
listed in the San Gabriel Register of Cultural Resources.
   (B)   Financial preservation incentives. The following financial incentives
shall be made available to owners of designated cultural resources, in a
process to be determined by the Director:
      (1)   Waiver of initial review for historic appropriateness/
administrative approval fees. All fees associated with the completion of an
initial review for historic appropriateness shall be waived for designated
cultural resources.
      (2)   Mills Act historic property contracts. Through the Mills Act
historic property contract program, the city allows owners of designated
cultural resources to receive a reduction in property taxes in exchange for a
commitment to complete specific repair, restoration, and/or rehabilitation
project and on-going maintenance in accordance with the Secretary’s Standards
and other applicable design guidelines and criteria. The City Council, on the
advice of the Director and Commission, shall periodically review and update the
application process, criteria, and procedures for Mills Act contracts, by
resolution or ordinance. The Mills Act was adopted by the city by resolution on
August, 21, 2001 (Resolution No. 01-31). The state-level enabling legislation
for the Mills Act program is contained in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 50280 through
50290.
      (3)   Preservation easements. Preservation easements may be acquired by
the city through donation or purchase. The preservation easement would be
accepted and administered by a state or local 501(c)(3) organization dedicated
to historic preservation. The easement would specify the conditions and
restrictions running with the land designed to preserve and maintain the
cultural resource.
   (C)   Regulatory preservation incentives. Designated cultural resources are
eligible for the following regulatory preservation incentives, which are
intended to encourage the preservation and ongoing use of the city’s cultural
resources. The following incentives shall be made available to owners of
designated cultural resources, in a process to be determined by the Director:
      (1)   California Historical Building Code. The California Historic
Building Code (Title 24, Part 8, California Administrative Code) shall guide
upgrades and alterations to designated cultural resources.
      (2)   Transfer of development rights. Through the transfer of development
rights (TDR) program, the City Council may by resolution approve the sale of
unused development rights from designated cultural resources (sender sites) to
development sites (receiver sites). Before any transferable development rights
are offered for sale, the city shall establish by resolution the criteria,
procedures, and public process, through the city’s formal bidding procedures,
to sell unused floor area development rights from sender sites to receiver
sites. TDR policies and procedures will be periodically reviewed and updated as
needed by the city.
      (3)   Exemption from design review. Design review shall be carried out
concurrently by the Historic Preservation and Cultural Resource Commission for
the following projects:
         (a)   All major alterations to designated cultural resources,
including individually listed properties and contributors to historic
districts;
         (b)   New construction and in-fill within the boundaries of designated
historic districts;
         (c)   All new construction, additions to, and alterations of a parcel
including a designated cultural resource, whether individually listed or a
contributor to a historic district.
      (4)   Exemption for nonconforming uses. On a case by case basis, a
preexisting nonconforming use or site condition may be changed to a permitted
use or site condition at the discretion of the Director, if the exemption
encourages the retention and ongoing viable use of a designated cultural
resource.
      (5)   Reduction of commercial parking requirements. At the discretion of
the Director, commercial properties included on the Register may be granted a
reduction in parking requirements, to a maximum of 50%, based on the degree to
which the historic character of the cultural resource would be preserved,
enhanced, or made more viable through the reduction in parking requirements.
      (6)   Residential waiver for garage space requirement.
         (a)   Residential properties included on the Register may be granted a
waiver of the requirement for an additional covered parking space for additions
of more than 25% of the existing gross floor area (§
153.049, Zoning Code, Garage Space Required). Waiving the requirement for
additional covered parking spaces encourages the retention and protection of
historic garages and carports, which contribute to the historic character and
integrity of historic districts and conservation overlay zones.
         (b)   This section allows the Director to waive the requirement for an
additional covered parking space where the Commission first determines through
the certificate of appropriateness approval process that:
            1.   The property has an existing historic garage or carport that
is a contributing element of the cultural resource;
            2.   The existing historic garage or carport can accommodate at
least one vehicle;
            3.   The existing historic garage or carport is structurally sound
or, if deteriorated, the Commission approves a rehabilitation plan for the
historic garage or carport as part of the certificate of appropriateness
approval process;
            4.   The second required parking space can be accommodated outside
of the existing covered parking space within an existing legal driveway or
tandem space;
            5.   The cumulative addition to the historic property is less than
50% of the existing floor area;
            6.   The additional living space does not include a new dwelling
unit on the property.

§ 153.629 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any person who violates a requirement of this subchapter or fails to
obey an order issued by the City Council, Commission and/or Director, or fails
to comply with a condition of approval of any certificate or permit issued
under this subchapter, shall be subject to enforcement actions as set forth in
§
153.005 (Violations) of this code.
   (B)   In addition to all other remedies available to the city, any
alteration or demolition of a cultural resource in violation of this subchapter
is expressly declared to be a nuisance and may be abated as deemed appropriate
by the city.
   (C)   In addition to all other remedies, the city shall have the authority
to impose a temporary moratorium on the development of a property for a period
not to exceed 60 months from the date the city becomes aware of any alteration
or demolition in violation of this subchapter, unless the owner obtains permits
to restore or reconstruct the property to its original condition prior to the
violation and the work is consistent with the Secretary’s Standards. The
purpose of the moratorium is to provide the city with an opportunity to study
and determine appropriate mitigation measures for the alteration and/or removal
of the cultural resource, and to ensure measures are incorporated into any
future development plans and approvals for the subject property. Mitigation
measures, as determined by the Commission and/or Director, shall be imposed as
a condition of any subsequent permit for development of the subject property.
   (D)   The City Attorney may maintain an action for injunctive relief to
restrain a violation or cause, where possible, the complete or partial
restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of any cultural resource
demolished, partially demolished, altered, or partially altered in violation of
this subchapter.
   (E)   Any person who constructs, alters, removes, or demolishes a cultural
resource without the approval and issuance of a certificate or permit issued
pursuant to this subchapter may be required to restore the property to its
appearance prior to the violation to the extent such restoration is physically
possible, under the guidance of the Director. This civil remedy shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal penalties available.
   (F)   In addition to any other remedies provided herein, any violation of
this subchapter may be enforced by civil action brought by the city. Remedies
under this subchapter are in addition to and do not supersede or limit any and
all other remedies or penalties, whether civil or criminal. The remedies
provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive. In any such action, the city
may seek as appropriate, one or both of the following remedies:
      (1)   A temporary or permanent injunction, or both;
      (2)   Assessment of the violator for the costs of any investigation,
inspection, or monitoring survey that led to the establishment of the
violation, and for the reasonable costs of preparing and bringing legal action
under this division (F).

§ 153.630 IDENTIFICATION, DOCUMENTATION, AND MANAGEMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL,
NATIVE AMERICAN, AND PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES.
   (A)   Purpose. In keeping with the goals and policies of General Plan
Chapter 11 (Cultural Resources), this section outlines the procedures and
criteria for the identification, documentation, and management of
archaeological, Native American, and paleontological cultural resources.
   (B)   Scope and applicability.
      (1)   Potential project impacts to those cultural resources that are
significant archaeological, Native American, and paleontological resources
shall be addressed during project review as described in this section. This
shall be accomplished through the identification of potential significant
cultural resources (Phase I), the evaluation of those resources’ significance
(Phase II), and, where necessary and appropriate, the mitigation of substantial
adverse impacts through data recovery/salvage (Phase III) by qualified
professionals as defined in §
153.603 of this subchapter.
      (2)   The provisions of this policy shall apply to all activities
including but not limited to proposed structures, expansions, additions,
alterations, grading, excavation, trenching, and/or demolition on properties
containing archaeological, Native American, or paleontological resources
classified as follows:
         (a)   Listed on the Register or Inventory;
         (b)   Listed on the California Register of Historical Resources or on
the National Register of Historic Places;
         (c)   Determined by the Director or the State Historic Preservation
Officer to be eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical
Resources, the National Register of Historic Places, or the Register;
         (d)   Or are located in areas with a high or medium potential for the
presence of cultural resources; in order to make this determination, the city
shall prepare or cause to be prepared a cultural resource sensitivity map.
   (C)   Report preparation.
      (1)   All development applications satisfying the above criteria shall be
required to submit a Phase I cultural resources inventory report and/or a
paleontological resources inventory report to the city as a part of their
application. Applications for properties that contain potential cultural
resources that have not been evaluated for significance shall be required to
submit a Phase II cultural resources evaluation report to the city as part of
their application. A development application shall not be considered complete
until said report(s) as required by this subchapter is submitted to the city.
      (2)   If the Director determines that the proposed project could
potentially affect a known or suspected cultural resource adjacent to the
project site, then the applicant will be required to submit a Phase I cultural
resources inventory report in order to determine whether the project has the
potential to impact the cultural resource.
      (3)   Cultural resources reports and paleontological resources reports
shall be the responsibility of the applicant. The reports shall be prepared by
qualified archaeologists or paleontologists as defined in §
153.603 of this subchapter.
      (4)   Cultural resources reports shall be prepared in a standard format:
the California Office of Historic Preservation Archaeological Resource
Management Reports (ARMR): Recommended Contents and Format. All cultural
resources reports and appended resource records shall be filed with the local
California Historical Resources Information System (CHRIS) Information Center.
      (5)   Paleontological resources reports shall be prepared in a standard
format and shall include a clear description and map of the project location,
as well as descriptions of the author’s qualifications; the criteria used to
evaluate the property; the study’s methods, limitations, and dates of
investigation; background materials consulted; the study’s results, including a
map and quantified list of identified paleontological resources identified on
the property; and the name of the facility where any recovered paleontological
resources will be curated.
      (6)   The report shall include a description and map indicating location
of specific sites, features, isolates, and fossils analyzed within the report.
The mapped location of archaeological sites, Native American resources, and
fossil localities is confidential information, not to be released for public
view. It is to be provided to the city as an appendix to the main report.
      (7)   The city may prepare or commission the preparation of Cultural
Resource Management Guidelines, in conjunction with a qualified archaeologist,
in order to establish the specific requirements for identifying, recording,
evaluating, and mitigating impacts to archaeological, Native American, and
paleontological resources, and for the preparation of Phase I, Phase II, and
Phase III reports and associated documentation.
   (D)   Exemptions. The following applications shall be exempt from the
requirements for submitting reports:
      (1)   Applications for a property for which a Phase I cultural resources
inventory report and/or paleontological resources report has been accepted by
the city within the last five years, provided that there were no significant
errors in methodology or content as determined by the Director and that the
application complies with any applicable mitigation requirements.
      (2)   Projects that require a permit application that will not excavate
deeper than 12 inches or excavate more than 50 cubic yards of earth, or those
for which the Director, based on expert advice, has determined in writing, that
the sediments to be disturbed do not have the potential to yield subsurface
artifacts, archaeological features, or fossils.
      (3)   Projects that are limited to repair and maintenance of existing
facilities and/or utilities without ground disturbing activities that extend
beyond the footprint of those facilities or utilities.
      (4)   Projects that are ground level residential additions less than 500
square feet and are in accordance with §
153.630.
   (E)   Review process.
      (1)   All development applications subject to the provisions of this
section shall be reviewed in the following manner in order to effectively
identify and evaluate any cultural resources that exist on the project site and
to mitigate substantial adverse changes to their significance:
      (2)   The applicable preliminary report shall be submitted to the
Director. The Director may take the following actions:
         (a)   If the report finds and the Director concurs that no significant
cultural resources are present, the Director shall require that the project
comply with on-site monitoring and mitigation (see division (F) below). The
Director may direct the city to retain the services of a separate qualified
archaeologist or a qualified paleontologist to provide an independent review of
these findings.
         (b)   If the report identifies the presence of archaeological, Native
American, or paleontological resources, the Director shall refer the report for
consideration to the Commission.
      (3)   The Commission, in reviewing the development proposal, shall
evaluate the report and incorporate mitigation conditions for the project in
order to preserve any known or identified significant archaeological, Native
American, or paleontological resources.
      (4)   Any conditions or mitigation measures required by the Director or
Commission shall be forwarded to the Building and Safety Division and enforced
in accordance with Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6.
      (5)   All decisions of the Director may be appealed to the Commission,
and all decisions of the Commission may be appealed to the City Council in
accordance with §
153.626 of this subchapter.
   (F)   On-site monitoring and mitigation (archaeological/Native American
resources).
      (1)   The Building and Safety Division shall be provided with an executed
consultant services contact with the individual responsible for supervising
onsite archaeological monitoring, who shall be a qualified archaeologist
selected from approved list of qualified archaeologists to be maintained by the
city.
      (2)   In instances, due to known or expected existence of subsurface
Native American resources or as an outcome of Native American consultation, the
consulting archaeologist or the Director may request that a Native American
monitor be present on-site during grading operations. If so requested, a
qualified Native American monitor shall be retained by the project applicant.
      (3)   If unanticipated subsurface cultural resources are discovered at
the site, the archaeologist shall take immediate steps to stop all construction
activity within 25 feet of the cultural material. The Director shall be
immediately informed of the situation. If it is determined that the find is an
isolated occurrence or that the remaining construction activity will not
significantly impact the cultural resource, work shall be permitted to continue
on the site. A report by the qualified archaeologist shall be submitted prior
to the final inspection of the site, detailing the contents of the unearthed
cultural resource.
      (4)   In the event of an unanticipated discovery of cultural resources
when neither an archaeologist nor Native American monitor is on site, the
information is to be communicated to the Director at once. In the event that
the discovery includes potential human remains, Cal. Health and Safety Code §
7050.5 and Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 5097.98 shall be followed.
      (5)   Should unanticipated cultural resources be encountered, work shall
be halted or diverted from the vicinity of the discovery until the significance
of the cultural resource can be determined by the Director. A recommendation
will be prepared by the qualified archaeologist indicating whether the find is
potentially significant and the recommended course of action for its protection
or further evaluation. The Director shall determine if the city should retain
the services of a separate consulting archaeologist to provide an independent
recommendation of site significance.
      (6)   On the Director’s recommendation, reports relating to the discovery
of significant archaeological or Native American resources shall be referred to
the Commission at their next available meeting. Notice of the hearing by the
Commission shall be given not less than ten days prior to any action taken on
the matter to be considered. Such notice shall include the date, time, and
place of the hearing and description of the matter under consideration. Notice
of the hearing shall also be sent to the property owner(s) of record and to
other persons who have requested to be notified of such matters, or whom the
Director or his or her designee determines may have an interest in the matter.
      (7)   The Commission, after considering the contents, recommendations,
and findings of the report, and after receiving and considering testimony by
interested individuals or groups, may take the following actions:
         (a)   Determine that the find is not significant and allow work to
resume.
         (b)   Determine that additional testing is necessary to evaluate the
significance of the find. If additional testing is determined necessary,
similar procedures as defined in divisions (F)(4) and (5) above shall be
followed.
         (c)   Determine that the proposed project will not significantly
affect the cultural resource and that it can be documented and left in situ
without compromising the integrity of the cultural resource.
         (d)   Forward a recommendation to the City Council to initiate data
recovery procedures or protect the artifacts in situ.
      (8)   If the Commission forwards a recommendation of either data recovery
or protection in situ that conflicts with currently approved plans, the item
shall be scheduled for consideration at the next meeting of the City Council as
an urgency item. The decision of the City Council shall be considered final.
      (9)   In the event that an unanticipated discovery of cultural material
is made, all expenses related to work performed shall be reimbursed by the
permit applicant.
      (10)   Whether cultural material is discovered or not, all monitors
(archaeologists and Native American) shall submit a written summary of their
services and observations.
      (11)   Prior to the issuance of any permit or action to proceed for the
demolition of a cultural resource, the owner may be required to allow for the
removal of significant features. The owner shall make these features available
to local historic interest or Native American groups. The expense of the
removal and storage of recovered features is to be borne by the historic
interest or Native American groups. The owner may also be required, as a
mitigation measure for any proposed demolition or alteration of a cultural
resource, to document the cultural resource through photographs and historic
narrative. These records will become the property of the city.
   (G)   On-site monitoring and mitigation enforcement (Paleontology).
      (1)   The Building and Safety Division shall be provided with an executed
consultant services contract with the individual responsible for supervising
on-site monitoring, who shall be a qualified paleontologist from an approved
list of qualified paleontologists to be maintained by the city to be present
on-site during grading operations.
      (2)   If paleontological material is present on the site, the qualified
paleontologist shall submit a report describing the fossils that exist on the
site. Said report shall include a statement on the significance of the
discovery and recommended actions. If the paleontologist finds that the find is
not significant, the Director may allow construction to proceed.
      (3)   On the Director’s recommendation, reports relating to the discovery
of significant paleontological resources shall be referred to the Commission at
their next available meeting. Notice of the hearing by the Commission shall be
given not less than ten days prior to any action taken on the matter to be
considered. Such notice shall include the date, time, and place of the hearing
and description of the matter under consideration. Notice of the hearing shall
also be sent to the property owner(s) of record and to other persons who have
requested to be notified of such matters, or whom the Director or his or her
designee determines may have an interest in the matter.
      (4)   The Commission, after considering the contents of the report, its
recommendations, and review of testimony by interested individuals or groups,
may take the following actions:
         (a)   Determine that the find is insignificant and allow work to
resume.
         (b)   Determine that additional study is necessary to evaluate the
significance of the fossils. Said study and report to be submitted within 30
days.
         (c)   Forward a recommendation to the City Council to initiate fossil
salvage procedures or protect the fossils in situ.
      (5)   If the Director forwards a recommendation of either fossil salvage
or protection in situ, the item shall be scheduled for consideration at the
next meeting of the City Council. The decision of the City Council shall be
considered final.
      (6)   Whether source material is discovered or not, a written report
shall be prepared by all paleontological monitors summarizing their services
and observations.
   (H)   Consultation with California Native American groups. California Native
American tribes traditionally and culturally affiliated with San Gabriel may
have expertise concerning their Native American resources, and consultation
with these groups is a required element of compliance with CEQA (Cal. Pub. Res.
Code § 21080.3.1).

§ 154.001 OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   One of the amenities that makes a city a desirable place to live
and contributes to the quality of life is having adequate open space and
recreational facilities within the city.
      (2)   The City Council desires to make sure that the city has adequate
open space and recreational facilities to serve its existing and future
residential population.
      (3)   The Open Space Chapter of the 2004 General Plan identifies a target
of four acres of open space per 1,000 residents; the city does not have
adequate facilities or funding to meet this target.
      (4)   The City Council's purpose in enacting this section is to implement
an open space and recreation fee that will be imposed on new residential
development to ensure that such development is funding a share of the costs of
developing open space areas to help meet the 2004 General Plan standard of four
acres of open space per 1,000 residents.
   (B)   Open space and recreation fee.
      (1)   An open space and recreation fee is hereby established to be
imposed upon all new residential development in the city in an amount to be
determined by resolution of the City Council. The amount of the fee shall not
exceed the new development's fair share of the costs of developing new open
space and recreation facilities, including the acquisition, design,
construction, equipment and financing.
      (2)   The fees imposed by this section shall be deposited in the Park and
Recreational Facilities Fund and shall be used only to finance the acquisition,
expansion, and development of park, recreational and open space facilities that
are needed as a result of new development within the city.
   (C)   Credit. Any person otherwise required to pay a fee under this section
may, with city approval, receive a credit when that owner constructs a park,
recreation or open space improvement. The credit shall offset, on a
proportionate basis without interest, the park and recreation impact fee
required to be paid under this section.
(Ord. 533-C.S., passed 11-16-04)
§ 154.002 SANITARY SEWER IMPACT FEE.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   Having adequate sewer capacity is essential to the health, well-
being and quality of life of all of those who live and work within the city.
      (2)   The Community Facilities Chapter of the 2004 General Plan
identifies a target sewer capacity of a peak factor of two times the average
flow and half full capacity.
      (3)   Existing sewer capacity in the city is not sufficient to
accommodate existing and future development within all areas of the city based
on the target adopted in the 2004 General Plan.
      (4)   The City Council's purpose in enacting this section is to implement
a sanitary sewer facility fee that will be imposed on new development
throughout the city to ensure that such development is funding its share of the
costs to upgrade the city's sewer system to handle the additional flow created
by such development, with such systems to be sized to meet the General Plan
standard.
   (B)   Sewer fee.
      (1)   A sanitary sewer system impact fee is hereby established to be
imposed upon all new development in the city in an amount to be determined by
resolution of the City Council. The amount of the fee shall not exceed the new
development's fair share of the costs of the sanitary sewer improvements.
      (2)   The fees imposed by this section shall be deposited in a Sanitary
Sewer System Facilities Fund and shall be used only to finance those sewer
improvements, or portions thereof, that are identified by resolution of the
City Council that are needed as a result of new development within the city.
   (C)   Credit. Any person otherwise required to pay a fee under this section
shall receive a credit when that person constructs a portion of the sanitary
sewer system that is to be funded by the fee.
(Ord. 533-C.S., passed 11-16-04)
§ 154.003 POLICE FACILITY IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   An adequate police department, which includes a facility large
enough to accommodate the sworn and non-sworn staff, contributes to the safety,
well-being and quality of life of all of those who live and work within the
city.
      (2)   The Community Facilities Chapter of the 2004 General Plan includes
a goal of providing a high level of police services for the city, which goal
includes providing sufficient police facilities.
      (3)   The current police facilities are inadequate for the current
population as well as new growth expected within the city. In order to provide
adequate police facilities, it is necessary to upgrade the facilities in terms
of both size and equipment.
      (4)   The City Council's purpose in enacting this section is to implement
a police facilities fee that shall be imposed upon all new development within
the city in order to ensure that such development is helping to pay its share
of the costs in upgrading the city's police facilities.
   (B)   Police facility fee.
      (1)   A Police Facility fee is hereby established to be imposed upon all
new development in the city in an amount to be determined by resolution of the
City Council. The amount of the fee shall not exceed the new development's fair
share of the costs of the new police facilities, including acquisition, design,
construction and financing.
      (2)   The fees imposed by this section shall be deposited in the Police
Facility Fund and shall be used only to finance the acquisition, design, and
construction of new police facilities identified by resolution of the City
Council that are needed as a result of new development within the city.
(Ord. 533-C.S., passed 11-16-04)
§ 154.004 FIRE FACILITY IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   An adequate fire department, which includes a facility large enough
to accommodate staff and equipment, is essential to and contributes to the
safety and quality of life of all of those who live and work within the city.
      (2)    The Community Facilities Chapter of the 2004 General Plan includes
the goal of providing a high level of fire protection and emergency response,
which goal includes the target of constructing new or modifying existing fire
stations.
      (3)   Existing fire facilities within the city are inadequate for the
current population as well as new growth expected within the city.
      (4)   The City Council's purpose in enacting this section is to implement
a fire facility fee that will be placed on all new development in the city to
ensure that such development is funding a share of the costs of upgrading the
existing fire facilities.
   (B)   Fire facility fee.
      (1)   A fire facility fee is hereby established to be imposed upon all
new development in the city in an amount to be determined by resolution of the
City Council. The amount of the fee shall not exceed the new development's fair
share of the costs of the new facility, including acquisition, design,
construction and financing.
      (2)    The fees imposed by this section shall be deposited in the Fire
Facility Fund and shall be used only to finance new fire facilities identified
by resolution of the City Council that are needed as a result of new
development within the city.
(Ord. 533-C.S., passed 11-16-04)
§ 154.005 TRAFFIC IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   Traffic congestion is one factor which leads to a deterioration in
the quality of life, as well as wastes productive time of those caught in
traffic.
      (2)   Traffic congestion and interrupted traffic flow are a problem
within the city and this problem will continue to worsen as the city builds
out.
      (3)   The Mobility Chapter of the 2004 General Plan identifies level of
service “D” as the target to be attained for principal intersections throughout
the city. This chapter also identifies the long-range improvements to streets
and intersections that are required to meet the target.
      (4)   The City Council's purpose in enacting this section is to implement
a traffic impact fee that shall be placed upon all new development within the
city in order to ensure that such development is helping to pay its share of
the costs in upgrading the city's traffic system to maintain a level of service
“D” at all intersections of arterial streets as required by the current General
Plan. Maintaining a level of service “D” at the intersections requires a level
of service “C” for the associated roadway links.
   (B)   Traffic impact fee.
      (1)   A traffic impact fee is hereby established to be imposed upon all
new development within the city in an amount to be determined by resolution of
the City Council. The amount of the fee shall not exceed the new development's
fair share of the costs of improvements which shall be based upon that portion
of the costs of the improvements attributable to that development, based upon
maintaining a level of service “D” at all intersections of arterial streets.
      (2)   The costs shall include design, construction, financing and
acquisition costs.
      (3)   The fees imposed by this section shall be deposited in the Traffic
Impact Fund and shall be used only to finance those roadway improvements
identified by resolution of the City Council that are needed as a result of new
development within the city.

shall receive a credit when such person constructs a portion of the roadway
system that is to be funded by the fee.
(Ord. 533-C.S., passed 11-16-04)
§ 154.006 GENERAL FEE PROVISIONS.
   The provisions of this section apply to each of the fees set forth above.
   (A)   New development. For purposes of this chapter NEW DEVELOPMENT shall
have the following meanings:
      (1)   NEW DEVELOPMENT, when applied to the development of residential
uses, including the placement of mobilehomes on real property, means that
development or installation which increases the number of dwelling units on a
given parcel or which increases the square footage of a residential use by at
least 25% of gross floor area.
      (2)   NEW DEVELOPMENT, when applied to construction or installation of
nonresidential buildings, means the development, construction or installation
of new buildings on a given parcel or which increases the amount of floor space
for nonresidential buildings by at least 25% of the gross floor area.
   (B)   Credit for existing development. All new development shall receive a
credit for any use on the property which currently exists and which will be
replaced by the new development. The fee shall only be charged for the
intensification of the use.
   (C)   Fund. Any reference in this chapter, or any resolution enacted
thereunder, to a specific capital facilities fund, shall mean a separate fund
or account.
   (D)   Fee adjustment.
      (1)   The developer of a project subject to a fee under this chapter may
request a waiver or adjustment of that fee based upon the absence of any
reasonable relationship between the impact on public facilities of that
development and either the amount of fee charged or the type of facilities to
be financed.
      (2)   The request shall be made in writing and shall be processed
concurrently with the development permit application for the project. If no
development permit is required, the request for a fee adjustment or waiver
shall be made with the application for a building permit. The request shall
state in detail the factual basis and legal theory for the waiver or
adjustment.
      (3)   The applicant shall bear the burden of proof of presenting
substantial evidence to support the request for an adjustment or waiver.
   (E)   Waiver of fee. Upon the request of the developer, all or a portion of
the fees set forth in this chapter may be waived for very low and low income
housing, as defined by Cal. Health and Safety Code §§ 50079.5 and 50105
respectively, when such housing is guaranteed affordability for a minimum
period of 30 years. The request for such a waiver shall be submitted in writing
and shall be processed with the development permit application for the project.
   (F)   When any of the fees set forth above are imposed upon a residential
development, the fees shall be collected in accordance with the provisions of
Cal. Government Code § 66007 as the same may be amended from time to time. Fees
for all other types of development projects shall be paid prior to the issuance
of the building permit.
   (G)   For each of the fees set forth above, the Finance Department shall
timely prepare the information required by Cal. Government Code § 66006, as the
same may be amended from time to time.
   (H)   Whenever fees are imposed pursuant to this chapter, the city shall
provide the project applicant with a notice in writing at the time of the
approval of the project or at the time of the imposition of the fees, a
statement of the amount of the fees and notification of the 90-day approval
period in which the applicant may protest the imposition of the fees. Said
notice shall be in substantially the following form:
The conditions of project approval for your project, identified as
                        , include certain fees, dedication requirements,
reservation requirements and/or other exactions more specifically described as:
(identification of the amount of the fee and description of the dedications,
reservation, or other exactions) . The applicant is hereby notified that the
90-day protest period to challenge such items has begun as of the date of the
project approval or the date of the fee imposition, which date was
                         . If the applicant fails to file a protest regarding
any of the fees, dedication, reservation, or other exaction requirements as
specified in Cal. Government Code § 66020, the applicant shall be legally
barred from later challenges.
   (I)   The fees established by this chapter are intended to establish a
supplemental method for funding the cost of certain facilities and services,
the demand for which will be generated by the expected build- out of the city.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the
City Council to impose any other fee or exactions or to continue to impose
existing ones on development within the city, but shall be in addition to any
other requirements which the City Council is authorized to impose, or has
previously imposed within the city. In particular, individual property owners
shall remain obligated to fund, construct, and/or dedicate the improvements,
public facilities and other exactions required by the city, including without
limitation those required by the city standard details and specifications and
other applicable public works standards. Any credits or reimbursements shall
not include the funding, construction or dedications described in this
division.
