§ 30.03 COUNCIL MEMBER ELECTIONS BY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Method of election of the members of the City Council. The elective
officers of the city shall be a Mayor and four Council members. The Council
shall consist of the Mayor and four Council members, each of whom, including
the Mayor, shall have the right to vote on all questions coming before the
Council.
      (1)   Council members. Each member of the Council shall serve a four year
term until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Members of the
Council shall be elected “by-district” and each district shall elect one
Council member. Only voters who live in a district shall be eligible to vote in
the election for Council member of that district. Except as provided in
division (B)(2) of this section, the Council member elected to represent a
district must reside in that district and be a registered voter in that
district, and any candidate for the Council must live in, and be a registered
voter in, the district in which he or she seeks election. Termination of
residency in a district by a Council member shall create an immediate vacancy
for that Council district unless a substitute residence within the district is
established within 30 days of the termination of residency.
      (2)   Mayor. The term of office of the Mayor shall be four years until
his or her successor is elected and qualified. The Mayor shall be elected by
the voters of the city at-large at each general municipal election, or as
otherwise provided by law. The Mayor shall be a resident of the city. The Mayor
in office at the time this section takes effect shall continue in office until
the expiration of the full term to which he or she was elected and until his or
her successor is elected and qualified.
   (B)   Establishment of Council member districts. Beginning with the general
municipal election in November 2016, members of the Council shall be elected on
a "by-district" basis from four Council member districts.
      (1)   Boundaries and numbering of each district.
         (a)   Each Council member district shall be assigned a district
number, with districts numbered one through four. The boundaries and the number
of each of the four electoral districts for the Council are set forth by City
Council resolution, including a map of the districts, which is incorporated
herein by reference. The electoral districts may be subsequently reapportioned
as provided by state law. The Council members of the two even-numbered
districts shall be elected by-district in November 2016 for a term of four
years.
         (b)   The Council members of the two odd-numbered districts shall be
elected by-district in November 2018 for a term of four years. After the
adoption of this section all persons appointed to fill vacancies on the Council
and all persons elected to fill vacancies on the Council at a special municipal
election shall reside within the district to which they are appointed or
elected.
      (2)   Technical changes to Council districts. If necessary to facilitate
the implementation of this section, the City Clerk is authorized to make
technical adjustments to the district boundaries that do not substantively
affect the populations in the districts, the eligibility of candidates, or the
residence of elected officials within any district. The City Clerk shall advise
the Council of any such adjustments that are found to be required in the
implementation of the district.
      (3)   Amendment of district boundaries. Pursuant to Cal. Elections Code §
21601, as it may be amended, the Council shall adjust the boundaries of any or
all of the districts following each decennial federal census. Using the census
as a basis, the Council shall adjust the boundaries so that the districts shall
be as nearly equal in population as practicable and in compliance with all
applicable provisions of law. Any adjustment of district boundaries shall be
made by resolution adopted by the Council before the first day of November of
the year following the year in which each decennial federal census is taken.
Prior to the public hearing approving the adjustment of the district
boundaries, the City Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed
district boundaries as required by Cal. Elections Code § 21601.
      (4)   Transition period. A period of transition from at-large elections
to by-district elections will occur from the time of adoption of the first
districting plan to the time that the by-district elections are held for all
Council member districts. During this period of transition, each Council member
elected at-large in the regular municipal election of November 2014 will be
designated by the Council as the Council member representing one of Districts
One and Three in the districting plan whether or not that Council member
resides in the district. The first by-district elections for Districts Two and
Four shall occur during the regular municipal election in November 2016. The
first by-district elections for Districts One and Three shall occur during the
regular municipal election In November 2018, Nothing contained herein shall
prevent an incumbent Council member at the time of the effective date of this
section from running for a Council district in which that Council member
resides other than the district for which that member currently holds office,
if the Council member is otherwise eligible to run in that district and vacates
the office of Council member for the district of non-residency if elected. No
Council member may hold office in more than one district. Each incumbent
Council member elected at-large shall be allowed to complete the term for which
they were elected regardless of the district of residency so long as they
otherwise remain eligible to hold the office and have not been removed for
cause or elected to another office.

requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 7200 et
seq.;
   (B)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 7200 et seq.;
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State
Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable
to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Cal.
Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 7200 et seq., minimize the cost of collecting city sales
and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this subchapter.
(`67 Code, § 6-2-4)
§ 34.23 CONTRACT WITH STATE.
   The city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all
functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use
tax ordinance.
(`67 Code, § 6-2-5)
§ 34.24 SALES TAX.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at a rate stated in §
34.21 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible
personal property sold at retail in this city.
(`67 Code, § 6-2-6)
§ 34.25 PLACE OF SALE.
   For the purposes of this subchapter, all retail sales are consummated at the
place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is
made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state
or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail
sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be
prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
(`67 Code, § 6-2-7)
§ 34.26 USE TAX.
   An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in

(`67 Code, § 6-2-8)

they are inconsistent with the provisions of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 7200 et
seq., all of the provisions of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 6001 et seq. are hereby
adopted and made a part of this subchapter as though fully set forth herein.

   (B)   In adopting the provisions of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 6001 et seq.,
wherever the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of
this city shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however, shall not
be made when the word “state” is used as part of the title of the State
Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of
Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of
California; the substitution shall not be made when the result of that
substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any
agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
subchapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including,
but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries
of the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an
exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt
from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain
subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§
6001 et seq., or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use
or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject
to tax by the state under the provisions of that code; the substitution shall
not be made in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence
thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828; and the substitution shall not be
made for the word “state” in the phrase “Retailer engaged in business in this
state” in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in
Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6203.

Ordinance of the City of Riverbank.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)
§ 34.46 DEFINITIONS.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction of this subchapter.
   HOTEL . Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel,
studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house,
dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed
location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
   OCCUPANCY . The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of
any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes.
   OPERATOR . The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a
managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing
agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this subchapter and
shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance
with the provisions of this subchapter by either the principal or the managing
agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON . Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.
   RENT . The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor or otherwise, including, all receipts, cash, credits and property and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR . The City Administrator.
   TRANSIENT . Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy
by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement
for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of
calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall
be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless
there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant
providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is
a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent
to the effective date of this subchapter may be considered.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)
§ 34.47 TAX IMPOSED.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to
and shall pay a tax in the amount of four percent of the rent charged by the
operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which
is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's
ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid
to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax
shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)
§ 34.48 EXEMPTIONS.

the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;
      (2)   Any federal or State of California officer or employee when on

authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those
requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this
city. This certificate does not constitute a permit."
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)
§ 34.51 REPORTING AND REMITTING.

Administrator, on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time
the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to
the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to
insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further information in
the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this subchapter
shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is
made to the Tax Administrator.

   (D)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails

ADMINISTRATOR.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within
the time provided in this subchapter, any report and remittance of said tax or
any portion thereof required by this subchapter, the Tax Administrator shall
proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the
Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able
to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
subchapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same as to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to
determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties
provided for by this subchapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax
Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of
address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such
notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on
the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined
by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not
less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax
Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is
taken as provided in
§ 34.54.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)

to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days of the
serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a
time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The
findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.
Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the
service of notice.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)
§ 34.55 RECORDS.

inspect at all reasonable times.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)
§ 34.56 REFUNDS.

or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city under this subchapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (B) and (C) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three years of the date of
payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in division (A) of this section, but only when the
tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the
transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)

tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be
deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the
city under the provisions of this subchapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 287, passed 12-13-65)

guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more
than $500 or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than
six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.
   (B)   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as
required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Tax
Administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty
of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make,
render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent
report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount
due required by this subchapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is
punishable as aforesaid.

waste.
   (B)   Violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute an
infraction and will be grounds for issuance of a notice of violation and
assessment of a fine by a City Manager, or his or her designee. Absent
compliance by the respondent within the deadline set forth in the notice of
violation, the City Manager or designated enforcement agency shall commence an
action to impose penalties, pursuant to the city's standard procedures or the

reasonable use of city staff and resources.
   (E)   Compliance deadline extension considerations. The city may extend the
compliance deadlines set forth in a notice of violation issued in accordance
with this section if it finds that there are extenuating circumstances beyond
the control of the respondent that make compliance within the deadlines

emergencies or natural disasters;
      (2)   Delays in obtaining discretionary permits or other government
agency approvals; or

violation may request a hearing to appeal the citation within 30 days of the
assessment of the penalty by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk.

has been paid for the particular lot or parcel. Subdivision lots shall be
exempt from the front footage charge when service laterals have been installed,
by the subdivider, to serve properties within the development.
      (2)   Front footage assessments will be made and paid to the city based
upon the property frontage along the street or alley where the connection is
made.
   (D)   Extension of sewer lateral. Whenever the installation of a new sewer
line is required to serve an applicant for sewer service, the applicant's
obligation or cost for sewer service will be the established front footage
assessment, inspection and connection fees, and monthly service charge. The
applicant shall advance to the city 100% of the cost of extending sewer service
to his or her property and the cost of the line across the full width of
applicant's property. The city will reimburse to the applicant the difference
between the applicant's obligation or costs and the total cost of the sewer
lateral extension over a ten-year period in equal annual installments, with no
interest, commencing one-year following the city's acceptance of the completed
project, provided however, that in the event it appears for any reason
unfeasible to extend a sewer lateral under the terms of this section, the city
may refuse to extend the sewer lateral or it may agree to extend the sewer
lateral under a separate agreement containing terms, conditions and provisions
for payment which are mutually agreed upon by the city and the property owner
or owners requesting the extension.
   (E)   Charges for connection to sewer lines financed by state or federal
funds.
      (1)   In the event state or federal funds are used in construction of a
sewer line, the front footage assessment and connection fees will be reduced
50%, for single-family residential applicants who hook on to the sewer line
within a 12-month period following the completion of the project. Following the
12-month period, single-family residential applicants for sewer service
involving connections to state or federal funded sewer lines will be assessed
the regular front footage and connection fees.
      (2)   All applicants other than single-family residential applicants
shall not receive a reduced connection and front footage assessment rate.
   (F)   Monthly sewer service charges. The following monthly sewer service
charges are hereby established for properties served by the city.
      (1)   Base monthly rates for residential, commercial and all other users
shall be as follows:
 
             October 1, July 1, 2016 July 1, 2017 July 1, 2018 July 1, 2019

Rate         $25.79     $33.01       $40.28       $47.12       $49.48
 
      (2)   In addition to the base monthly rates, all non-residential users
will be charged a variable rate, based on gallon usage over 7,480 gallons. The
rate shall be assessed as follows:
 
Commercial Classification                                Class    Variable Rate
Group 1: Schools without cafeterias, offices             Low      $0.002512
Group 2: Commercial, hospitals, extended care
facilities, markets without delis, automobile servicers, Domestic $0.00335

order facilities, markets with delis
Group 4: Restaurants with full kitchens                  High     $0.00737
 
      (3)   Multiple accounts on one meter. Where more than one residence or
business is served by a common meter, a composite sewer rate shall be
determined, based on the number and type of residences and businesses served by
the meter. The composite rate shall be computed as a weighted average of the
respective sewer rates for the individual residences and businesses based on
categories and rates established previously in this section. The composite rate
shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the city, using estimated flows
for the individual businesses and the respective sewer rates established for
specific categories.
         (a)   The weighted average is computed by estimating the amount of
flow by their individual rate (assuming they were on individual meters), and
summing the total cost and flow for the multiple account meters.
         (b)   Composite rates will vary from multiple accounts to multiple
accounts, depending on the mix of user types for the shared meter.
      (4)   All sewer service charges shall be billed on a bimonthly basis. The
bimonthly rates shall double the monthly rates during the time the bimonthly
billings are in effect.
      (5)   All sewer service charges are due and payable upon receipt and
shall be considered delinquent if not paid seven days after mailing or e-
mailing by the city. Any bills not paid within such period are considered
delinquent.
      (6)   Any sewer charges, which are not paid by close of business 34
calendar days after the bill is issued, shall have a service charge of 10% of
the billing assessed at the time of payment.
      (7)   Deposit. Applicants for utility services are required to establish
credit before receiving such service. Credit shall be deemed established if the
applicant meets one of the following options:
         (a)   Makes a cash deposit of $100 as a guarantee for the payment of
future bills.
         (b)   Has been a customer of city utility services for 12 consecutive
months within the last 18 months, and during such time has paid all bills
without any delinquency.
         (c)   1.   Provide the city with a letter of credit reference from
another utility company showing an on-time payment record for the period of at
least the 12 consecutive months directly prior to the date of the requested
service.
            2.   If a consumer fails to pay a bill for sewer services, the city
may apply the deposit insofar as necessary to liquidate the account and may
require that the deposit be restored to an amount twice the original deposit
amount. After a cash deposit to guarantee payment for sewer service has stood
unimpaired for 12 months, such deposit shall be applied to the depositor's
current account balance. Upon closing any account, the balance of any deposit
remaining, after the closing bill for service has been paid, shall be returned
promptly to the depositor.
      (8)   Sewer service charges set forth herein may be increased or
decreased by resolution of the City Council.
   (G)   Septic tank destruction permit. Any property owner seeking to abandon
his or her septic tank must first obtain a septic tank destruction permit from
the City of Riverbank Public Works Department. The fee for the permit shall be

Administration                 1.0 hours
Total annual permit fee        3.5 hours
 
      (2)   At the time the permit is issued, the final fee as determined by
the then current staff rate as determined by inflation will be paid annually
for the management, administration and inspection of the grease removal device
for the food service establishment discharge permit.
      (3)   This fee shall be updated as necessary using the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) to cover the cost of inflation for implementing the fats oils and
grease reduction program.
      (4)   Re-inspection fees necessary as a result of a violation of the
permit shall be in the amount set forth in division (A) above.
   (I)   Other fees associated with the installation of a grease interceptor as
required by the food service establishment discharge permit.
      (1)   Additional fees to cover the cost of engineering and inspection of
a new grease interceptor shall be calculated as follows:
 
Business license review  0.5 hours
Plan review              1.5 hours
Construction inspection  1.0 hours

      (2)   If a temporary permit is granted for the discharge of such water
into a tributary sewer, the user shall pay the applicable charges for use and
fees, and shall meet such other conditions as required by the city.
   (C)   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Director of Public Works may impose mass limitations on users who are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 95-05, passed 4-10-95)
§ 51.25 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with
prohibitions set out in
§ 51.24 of this subchapter within the time limitations specified by the
Director of Public Works. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Director of Public Works for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director of
Public Works before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Director of Public Works may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter.
      (2)   The Director of Public Works may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense,
a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Works, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Director of
Public Works and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (C)   Accidental discharge/sludge control plans. At least once every two
years, the Director of Public Works shall evaluate whether each significant
industrial user needs an accidental discharge/sludge control plan. The Director
of Public Works may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and
implement such a plan. Alternatively, the Director of Public Works may develop
such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/sludge control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of Public Works
and POTW Supervisor of any accidental or sludge discharge, as required by
§ 51.28 of this subchapter; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or sludge
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

§ 51.26 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (A)   Wastewater analysis. When requested by the Director of Public Works, a
significant industrial user must submit information on the nature and
characteristics of its wastewater within 60 days of the request. The Director
of Public Works is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may
periodically require significant industrial users to update this information.
   (B)   Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
         (1)   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into
the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the
Director of Public Works, except that a significant industrial user that has
filed a timely application pursuant to division (C) below of this section may
continue to discharge for the time period specified therein.
      (2)   The Director of Public Works may require other users to obtain
wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this
subchapter.
      (3)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this subchapter and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in
§ 51.32 of this subchapter. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not
relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of
federal, state, and local law.
   (C)   Wastewater discharge permitting: existing connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater

(Ord. 95-05, passed 4-10-95)
§ 51.28 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined
by the Director of Public Works but in no case less than twice per year (in
June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
§ 51.26 of this subchapter.
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Director of Public
Works, using the procedures prescribed in division (G) of this section, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (B)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Director of
Public Works of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or
system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at
least 90 days before the change.
      (1)   The Director of Public Works may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
§ 51.26(F) of this subchapter.
      (2)   The Director of Public Works may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under
§ 51.26(G) of this subchapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under
§ 51.27(D) of this subchapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
      (3)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
   (C)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a sludge load, that may cause potential
problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Director of Public Works and POTW Superintendent of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Director of Public Works, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred
as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this subchapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director
of Public Works as the Director of Public Works may require.
   (E)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Director of
Public Works within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Director of Public Works within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. The user is not required to resample if the Director of Public
Works monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the Director
of Public Works samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user
receives the results of this sampling.
   (F)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must
be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
   (G)   Sample collection.
      (1)   Except as indicated in division (2), below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Director of Public
Works may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four
grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (H)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   (I)   Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
subchapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this subchapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant
to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Director of Public Works.
(Ord. 95-05, passed 4-10-95)
§ 51.29 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Right of entry: inspection and sampling. The Director of Public Works
or his/her designated representative shall have the right to enter the premises
of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this subchapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
Users shall allow the Director of Public Works or his/her designated
representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Director of Public Works or his/her designated
representative will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of
performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Director of Public Works or his/her designated representative
shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation
of; such devices as are necessary to conduct wastewater sampling and metering
(flow measurement) of the user's operations.
      (3)   The Director of Public Works or his/her designated representative
may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All
devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated monthly
to ensure their accuracy. The monitoring facilities design shall be approved by
the Director of Public Works prior to installation.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Director of Public Works or his/
her designated representative and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be born by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works or
his/her designated representative access to the user's premises shall be a
violation of this subchapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Director of Public Works or his/her designated
representative has been refused access to a building, structure, or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this subchapter or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city
designed to verity compliance with this subchapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the Director of Public Works may seek issuance of a
search warrant from the appropriate court.
(Ord. 95-05, passed 4-10-95)
§ 51.30 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from Director of Public Works or his/her designated
representative inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works or his/her
designated representative, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at
the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.
(Ord. 95-05, passed 4-10-95)
§ 51.31 PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The Director of Public Works shall publish annually, in the largest
daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list
of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   The term SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
      (2)   Any other discharge violation that the Director of Public Works
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public;
      (3)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in Director of Public
Works or his/her designated representative exercise of its emergency authority
to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (4)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
      (5)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports as required in
§ 51.28 of this subchapter;
      (6)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (7)   Any other violation(s) which the Director of Public Works
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
(Ord. 95-05, passed 4-10-95)
§ 51.32 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. When the Director of Public Works finds
that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
subchapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may
serve upon that user a written notice of violation (NOV). Within 30 days of the
receipt of this NOV, or such shorter period as may be prescribed in the NOV, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the Director of Public Works. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Director of Public Works to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The Director of Public Works may enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents
shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to divisions (D) and (E) of this section and shall be judicially
enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Director of Public Works may order a user
which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter,
a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Director of Public
Works and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Director of Public Works may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

§ 51.42 ADMINISTRATION.
   Except as otherwise provided herein, the Director of Public Works shall
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this subchapter. Any powers
granted to or duties imposed upon the Director of Public Works may be delegated
by the Director of Public Works to other city personnel.
   (A)   Food service establishment permit requirement. All establishments
discharging wastewater to the city sanitary sewer collection system are subject
to the permit requirements of §
51.26 and following.
      (1)   Grease interceptor requirements. All permitted food service
establishments including restaurants, cafeterias, diners and similar non-
industrial facilities using food preparation processes that generate FOG are
required to install, operate and maintain an approved type and adequately sized
grease interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with the objectives of this
subchapter.
      (2)   Implementation.
         (a)   New establishment. All new food service establishment facilities
are subject to grease interceptor requirements. All such facilities must obtain
prior approval from the Director of Public Works for grease interceptor sizing
prior to submitting plans for a building permit. All grease interceptors shall
be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
         (b)   Existing facilities. Existing facilities with planned
modification under a building permit with valuations set forth in the FSE
Policy will be required to include plans to comply with the grease interceptor
requirements. These facilities must obtain approval from the Director of Public
Works for grease interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a building
permit.
            1.   All existing food service establishments, determined by the
Director of Public Works, to have a reasonable potential to adversely impact
the city’s sewer system will be notified of their obligation to install a
grease interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification
letter.
            2.   Existing food service establishments which generate, and
discharge wastewater containing FOG, and which have an existing non-complying
FOG pretreatment system may, as determined by the city, operate the existing
FOG pretreatment system. Such facilities shall submit an application for a
permit and include applicable information to amend the existing permit or
submit an application for a new permit if no permit exists.
      (3)   Variance from grease interceptor requirements. Grease interceptors
required under this subchapter shall be installed unless the Director of Public
Works authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap or other alternative
pretreatment technology and determines that the installation of a grease
interceptor would not be feasible.
      (4)   Costs. All costs and related expenses associated with the
installation and connection of the FOG Interceptor(s) or Alternate Pretreatment
System(s) shall be borne by the food service establishment. The food service
establishment shall indemnify the city and its agents for any loss or damage
that may directly or indirectly occur due to the installation of the FOG
pretreatment system.
   (B)   Conditional waivers. Existing FSEs that do not meet the requirements
set forth in division (A)(2) above may apply for a conditional waiver. The
conditional waiver will specify requirements that the FSE must comply with to
operate without an interceptor. The Director of Public Works or designee will
continually review FSE compliance with the conditional waiver requirements. A
conditional waiver may be revoked at any time for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Quantity of FOG discharge as measured or as indicated by the size
of FSEs based on seating capacity, number of meals served, menu, water usage,
amount of on-site consumption of prepared food and other conditions have
changed since the granting of the waiver such that the FSE is contributing to
FOG discharges;
      (2)   Identification of the FSE as a significant contributor of FOG into
the Sewer System, which is based on inspection or sampling of the FOG
discharged from the FSE’s sewer lateral to the sewer system;
      (3)   Adequacy of implementation and compliance with Kitchen Best
Managements Practices (BMPs);
      (4)   Change in sewer size, grade and condition based on visual
information;
      (5)   Changes in operations that significantly affect FOG discharge;
      (6)   Failure to comply with any of the conditions set forth in the
waiver; and
      (7)   Any other condition deemed reasonably related to the generation of
FOG discharges by the Director of Public Works.
   (C)   Exemptions. Exemption from the FSE discharge permit: An exemption may
be granted to limited food preparation establishment. A limited food
preparation establishment engages only in reheating, hot holding or assembly of
ready to eat food products and as a result, no wastewater discharge containing
a significant amount of fats, oils and grease. A limited food preparation
establishment does not include any operation that changes the form, flavor or
consistency of food.
   (D)   Pretreatment requirements.
      (1)   Grease interceptor requirements.
         (a)   Grease interceptors shall be installed at a location where it
shall be easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of intercepted
grease. The grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of the building
where food is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must meet the
approval of the Director of Public Works.
         (b)   All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain Minimum Design
Capability or effective volume. These devices should be inspected annually at
minimum. Users who are required to maintain a grease interceptor shall:
            1.   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time to facilitate
the separation of oils and grease to the extent that oil and grease
concentrations in wastewaters discharged to the sewage system owned, operated
and maintained by the city, do not exceed established discharge limitations set
by the city as defined in §
51.44;
            2.   Remove any accumulated grease caps and sludge pockets as
required. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials
which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of
the device; and
            3.   Be serviced (pumped, cleaned and inspected) by a city
permitted liquid waste hauler, at a minimum frequency to ensure proper
function. Records of grease interceptors shall be in accordance to division (E)
below.
         (c)   Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following
adoption of this subchapter, although installation of grease interceptors will
be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
subchapter for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease
interceptors. However; if, during this one year period an obstruction of a
sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact
on the environment is realized and that the overflow or failure of the sanitary
sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole
to an accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the city will take
appropriate enforcement actions, as stipulated in
Chapter 51, against the generator or contributor of such grease.
      (2)   Grease trap requirements.
         (a)   Upon approval by the Director of Public Works, a grease trap
complying with the provisions of this section must be installed in the waste
line leading from sinks, drains and other fixtures or equipment in food service
establishments where grease may be introduced into the drainage or sewage
system in quantities that can effect line stoppage or hinder sewage treatment
or private sewage disposal.
         (b)   Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating
conditions by periodic removal of the accumulated grease. No such collected
grease shall be introduced into any drainage piping, or public or private
sewer.
         (c)   Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following
adoption of this subchapter, although installation of grease traps will be
required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
subchapter for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from the
facility. However; if, during this one year period an obstruction of a sewer
main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the
environment is realized and that the overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer
collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an
accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the city will take appropriate
enforcement actions, as stipulated in the Industrial Pretreatment Enforcement
Plan and Sewer Use Ordinance, against the generator or contributor of such
grease.
   (E)   Compliance monitoring.
      (1)   City personnel may inspect the facilities of any establishment
required to have a grease interceptor or similar device, to determine whether
the requirements set fourth in this subchapter are being met. Compliance
monitoring shall be conducted pursuant to §
51.29 and as follows:
         (a)   City personnel will inspect or order the inspection and sample
the wastewater discharges of any food service establishment annually; and
         (b)   Failure of the inspection and cause for re-inspection shall be
at the expense of the user subject to the inspection fee outlined in §
51.03(H).
      (2)   The establishments shall be required to keep all manifests,
receipts and invoices of all cleaning, maintenance, inspection, grease removal
of/from the grease control device, disposal carrier and disposal site location
for no less than three years. The establishment shall, upon request, make the
manifests, receipts, invoices and any other applicable documentation available
to the Director of Public Works or his or her designee.
   (F)   Requirements to self-monitor.
      (1)   The city may require establishments to construct and maintain in
proper operating condition at the establishment’s sole expense, flow
monitoring, constituent monitoring and/or sampling facilities.
      (2)   Those establishments discharging under a conditional waiver may be
required by the Director of Public Works to install sampling facilities for
compliance monitoring.
      (3)   The location of the monitoring or metering facilities shall be
subject to approval by the Director of Public Works.
      (4)   Establishments may also be required by the Director of Public Works
to submit waste analysis plans, contingency plans and meet other necessary
requirements to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the grease control
device.
      (5)   Establishments shall not increase the use of water or in any other
manner attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
treatment to achieve compliance.

   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect and promote the health,
safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city by controlling non-storm
water discharges to the storm water conveyance system from spills, dumping, or
disposal of materials other than storm water, and by reducing pollutants in
urban storm water discharges to the maximum extent practicable.
   (B)   This chapter is intended to assist in the protection and enhancement
of the water quality of watercourses, water bodies, and wetlands in a manner
pursuant to and consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251
et seq.) by reducing pollutants in storm water discharges to the maximum extent
practicable and by prohibiting non-storm water discharges into the storm drain
system.
   (C)   The scope provides for the control and regulation of discharges to the
MS4 and receiving waters, through a program of education and enforcement of
general and specific prohibitions and requirements. This chapter applies to all
dischargers and places of discharge located within the city that discharge
storm water or non-storm water into any MS4 or receiving waters. Through a
program employing watershed-based approaches that balance environmental and
economic considerations, the city seeks to protect and promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens with the implementation of
the following objectives:
      (1)   To comply with all federal and state laws, lawful standards, and
orders applicable to storm water and urban runoff pollution control;
      (2)   To prohibit and reasonably control any discharge that may interfere
with the operation of, or cause any damage to the MS4, or impair the beneficial
uses of the receiving waters;
      (3)   To prohibit illicit discharges to the MS4;
      (4)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-
point source pollution wherever feasible, through storm water management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained;
      (5)   To reduce pollutants in storm water and urban runoff;
      (6)   To reduce unauthorized non-storm water discharges to the MS4 to the
maximum extent practicable;
      (7)   To develop and implement effective educational outreach programs
designed to educate the public on issues of storm water and urban runoff
pollution;
      (8)   To establish adequate legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance and monitoring, or other procedures necessary to ensure compliance
with this chapter.

undertake the measures set forth below to reduce the risk of non-storm water
discharge and/or pollutant discharge.
   (A)   Business related activities.
      (1)   Storm water pollution prevention plan.
         (a)   The enforcement official may require any business in the city
that is engaged in activities which may result in pollutant discharges to
develop and implement a storm water pollution prevention plan, which must
include an employee training program.
         (b)   Business activities which may require a storm water pollution
prevention plan include, but are not limited to, maintenance, storage,
manufacturing, assembly, equipment operations, vehicle loading or fueling, or
cleanup procedures which are carried out partially or wholly out of doors.
      (2)   Coordination with hazardous materials release response plans and
inventory. Any business requiring a hazardous materials release response and
inventory plan under Chapter 6.95 (commencing with § 25500) of Division 20 of
the California Health and Safety Code, shall include in that plan provisions
for compliance with this chapter, including the provisions prohibiting non-
storm water discharges and illegal discharges, and requiring the release of
pollutants to be reduced to the maximum extend practicable.
      (3)   Coordination with hazardous waste generator contingency plan and
emergency procedures. Any business requiring a hazardous waste generator
contingency plan and emergency procedures pursuant to California Code of
Regulations, Title 22, §§ 66265.51 to 66265.56, shall include in that plan
provisions for compliance with this chapter, including the provisions
prohibiting non-storm water discharge and illegal discharges, and requiring the
release of pollutants to be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.
   (B)   Construction.
      (1)   Any person performing construction activities in the city shall
prevent pollutants from entering the storm water conveyance system and comply
with all applicable federal, Stale and local laws, ordinances or regulations,
including but not limited to, the current California NPDES General Permit for
storm water discharges associated with construction activity (Construction
General Permit) and the City Storm Water Management and Discharge Control
Ordinance. All construction projects, regardless of size, having soil
disturbance or activities exposed to storm water must, at a minimum, implement
BMPs for erosion and sediment controls, soil stabilization, dewatering, source
controls, pollution prevention measures, and prohibited discharges.
      (2)   Any person subject to a construction activity NPDES storm water
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
enforcement official prior to, or as a condition of. a subdivision map, site
plan, building permit, grading permit, or development or improvement plan, upon
inspection of the facility, during any enforcement proceeding or action, or for
any other reasonable cause. Prior to issuance of a construction permit or
approval of the proposed improvement plans, for projects subject to the state's
current Construction NPDES General Permit, the WDID number and the SWPPP shall
be submitted to the city. For projects with less than an acre of soil
disturbance or not subject to the Construction General Permit, an Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan (ESCP) and the ESCP Worksheet must be submitted to the
city.
      (3)   As required by its Phase II MS4 NPDES Permit, the city will conduct
storm water compliance inspections at applicable construction sites that have
areas of soil disturbance exposed to storm water. The inspection will be
conducted by a city inspector or agent working for the city who is a Qualified
SWPPP Practitioner (QSP) or is supervised by a QSP. The inspection will
evaluate the construction site's compliance to the city's storm water
ordinances. Inspections will be billed by the city to the project owner. The
following is the risk rating system and inspection frequency the city will use,
which is analogous to the risk rating used by the California Construction
General Permit:
         (a)   Projects not subject to the CGP or that have an Erosivity Waiver
will have a pre-soil disturbance inspection and a project completion
inspection.
         (b)   Projects that are Risk 1/LUP Type 1 or Risk 2/LUP Type 2 will
have a pre-soil disturbance inspection, monthly inspections, and a project
completion inspection.
         (c)   Projects that are Risk 3/LUP Type 3 will have a pre-soil
disturbance inspection, bimonthly (twice per month) inspections, and a project
completion inspection.
      (4)   If a project has been issued two consecutive notices of violation
or does not correct a previously issued notice of violation by the due date set
by the inspector, the project's "threat to water quality" will be elevated by
the city to the next highest category. This elevation of risk will not affect
the risk rating for the Construction General Permit.
   (C)   Development.
      (1)   The enforcement official may develop controls as appropriate to
minimize the long-term, post construction discharge of storm water pollutants
from new development(s) or modifications to existing development(s). Controls
may include source control measures to prevent pollution of storm water and/or
treatment controls designed to remove pollutants from storm water, low impact
development measures, and/or hydromodification measures to offset the
difference between the pre and post-construction peak flow runoff rates and
volumes. Proponents of all applicable development and redevelopment projects
will be required to meet the requirements and design standards specified in the
current State of California Phase II MS4 NPDES permit.
      (2)   At the earliest planning stages, project proponents shall assess
and evaluate how site conditions, such as soils, vegetation, and flow paths
will influence the placement of buildings and paved surfaces. The evaluation
will be used to optimize the site layout to meet the goals of capturing and
treating runoff. Each project proponent will submit a map of the project
dividing the site into discrete drainage management areas to show in each how
runoff will be managed using site design measures, source controls, treatment
controls, and hydromodification measures as defined by the current MS4 permit.
All site design measures, source controls, treatment controls, and
hydromodification measures must be selected, sized, and situated in accordance
with the guidance provided in the current MS4 permit. Documentation of the
site's post-construction storm water design measures must be submitted to the
city's Planning Department for review and approval prior to the commencement of
the project.
      (3)   Project proponents must sign an operation and maintenance agreement
in which they legally bind themselves to maintain the installed post-
construction design measures in an effective and good operational condition
until the property ownership is transferred. A written operation and
maintenance plan for the proposed storm water design measures is required to be
submitted to and approved by the city with the signed agreement. The agreement
will be recorded with the deed by the County Clerk making it transferrable to
the new owner; or, when there are multiple property owners responsible for the
maintenance of the control measures, the agreement will consist of a legally
binding covenant between the city and the homeowners association or maintenance
district. The owner or association responsible for the maintenance of the
control measures may be required by the city to submit an annual self-
certification that the storm water control measures are effective and are being
maintained in accordance with the submitted and approved Operation and
Maintenance Plan.
   (D)   Compliance with Industrial or Construction Activity Storm Water
Permit.
      (1)   Any person subject to the state's current Industrial NPDES General
Permit for storm water discharge shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the enforcement official upon inspection of the facility; during
any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause.
      (2)   Any person subject to the state's current Construction NPDES
General Permit for storm water discharge shall comply with all provisions of
such permit. Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the enforcement official prior to or as a condition of a
subdivision map, site plan, building permit, and development or improvement
plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or
action; or for any other reasonable cause.
      (3)   Compliance with best management practices. Every person or entity,
including the above-listed categories, undertaking any activity or use of
premises that may cause or contribute to storm water pollution or contamination
or illicit discharges shall comply with best management practice (BMPs)
consistent with the California Storm Water Quality Association (CASQA) Best
Management Practice Handbooks or equivalent guidelines,

§ 53.13 CONTAINMENT AND NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Any person owning or occupying a premises who has knowledge of any release
of pollutants or non-storm water discharge from or across those premises which
might enter the storm water conveyance system, other than a release or
discharge that is permitted by this chapter, shall immediately take all
reasonable action to contain and abate the release of pollutants or non-storm
water discharge, and shall notify the enforcement agency within 24 hours of the
release of pollutants or non-storm water discharge. For the purpose of
containment, all vehicles within 100 feet of a storm water management facility
shall be stored and parked on a paved surface that is capable of containing all
reasonably expected discharges from vehicles to the satisfaction of the
Director of Public Works.

CHAPTER 74: USE OF ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION BRAKING DEVICES
Section
   
74.01   Use of engine or transmission braking devices
§ 74.01 USE OF ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION BRAKING DEVICES.
   (A)   Findings. The City Council finds that the use of engine or
transmission braking devices or methods (aka "jake braking" or "dynamic
braking") within the city limits creates unusual and excessive noise that
unreasonably disturbs and annoys residents. The prohibition of such devices and
methods is necessary to protect the health, safety, and public welfare.
   (B)   Prohibition. No person may slow a vehicle by a device, method, or
practice known as engine or transmission braking, also referred to as "jake
braking" or "dynamic braking", whereby rapid downshifting of a vehicle's engine
or a compression release device is used in lieu of applying a vehicle's wheel
brakes, causing loud noises to emit from the vehicle's engine and exhaust
system. Such braking by any motor vehicle on any public highway, street,
parking lot, or alley within the city is declared to be a public nuisance and
is prohibited.
   (C)   Emergency vehicles. The foregoing provision does not apply to
emergency vehicles.

§ 90.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDONED VEHICLE. Includes the following:
      (1)    ABANDONED VEHICLE. A vehicle is “abandoned” if it is left on a
highway, public property, or private property in such inoperable or neglected
condition that the owner's intention to relinquish all further rights or
interests in it may be reasonably concluded. In reference to highways,
“abandonment” is presumed to have occurred if a vehicle is left 72 hours or
more on the highway, or is parked, resting or otherwise immobilized on any
highway or public right-of-way; and lacks an engine, transmission, wheels,
tires, doors, windshield, or any other part or equipment necessary to operate
safely on the highway. Such vehicles are presumed to be a hazard to public
health, safety, and welfare and may be removed immediately upon discovery by a
peace officer or other designated employee.
      (2)    DISMANTLED VEHICLE. Any vehicle that is partially or wholly
disassembled.
      (3)    INOPERATIVE VEHICLE. Any motor vehicle that cannot be moved under
its own power.
      (4)    PUBLIC NUISANCE VEHICLE. Any vehicle or parts thereof, that is
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative, that is left that creates a
condition tending to reduce the value of private property, promotes blight and
deterioration, invites plundering, creates fire hazards, constitutes an
attractive nuisance endangering the health and safety of minors, harbors
rodents and insects, or jeopardizes health, safety and general welfare.
      (5)    WRECKED VEHICLE. Any vehicle that is damaged to such an extent
that it cannot be operated upon the highway. A vehicle which has been wrecked
in a traffic accident, and which has been removed from the roadway to a storage
facility, but which has not been claimed by its owner will not be considered an
abandoned vehicle.
   EMPLOYEE. A city employee designated by the Director of Public Works.
   HIGHWAY. A way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to
the use of the public for purposes of vehicular traffic. Highway includes a
street, and all or any part of the entire width of the right-of-way of said
highway.
   PEACE OFFICER. An individual as defined in Cal. Penal Code §§ 830 et seq.
   VEHICLE. A device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be
propelled, moved or drawn upon a highway, excepting a device moved by human
power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.
(Ord. 99-05, passed 5-10-99)
§ 90.02 FINDINGS.
   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the
authority granted by the state under Cal. Veh. Code § 22660 to remove
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts as public
nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings and declaration:
   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicles or parts, on private or public property, including
highways, creates a condition tending to reduce the value of private property,
promotes blight and deterioration, invites plundering, created fire hazards,
constitutes an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety
of minors, created a harborage for rodents and insects and is injurious to the
health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts, on private or public
property, including highways is declared to constitute a nuisance which may be
abated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 99-05, passed 5-10-99)
§ 90.03 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   No person shall abandon a vehicle upon any highway. Any violation of
this section constitutes an infraction.
   (B)   Every person who parks or leaves a vehicle on a highway for 72
consecutive hours or more is guilty of an infraction.
   (C)   No person shall abandon a vehicle upon public or private property
without the express or implied consent of the owner or person in lawful
possession or control of the property. Any violation of this section
constitutes an infraction.
   (D)   A person convicted of a violation of this section shall pay a penalty
set forth in
§ 10.99 of the City Code, and in addition, such person shall provide proof that
the costs of removal and disposition of the vehicle have been paid. No part of
any fine imposed shall be suspended. The fine may be paid in installments if
the court determines that the defendant is unable to pay the entire amount in
one payment.
   (E)   Proof that the costs of removal and disposition of the vehicle have
been paid shall not be required if proof is provided to the court that the
vehicle was stolen prior to abandonment. That proof may consist of a police
report or other evidence acceptable to the court.

§ 90.05 AUTHORITY FOR REMOVAL OF VEHICLES.
   (A)   Any peace officer or any other employee, in the territorial limits in

limits in which the officer or employee may act, when any vehicle is abandoned,
parked or left standing upon a highway for 72 or more consecutive hours.
   (C)   Motor vehicles which are abandoned, parked, resting, or otherwise
immobilized on any highway or public right-of-way and which lack an engine,
transmission, wheels, tires, doors, windshield, or any other part or equipment
necessary to operate safely on the highways of this state are a public nuisance
and may be removed immediately upon discovery by a peace officer or employee.
   (D)   Any person performing a franchise or contract awarded pursuant to Cal.
Veh. Code § 22710(a) may remove a vehicle from a highway or from public or
private property, after a determination by a peace officer or other employee
that the vehicle is abandoned, as determined pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code §
22523.
(Ord. 99-05, passed 5-10-99)
Statutory reference:
   Similar provisions, see Cal. Veh. Code §§ 22651(k) and 22669
§ 90.06 RIGHT OF ENTRY ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (A)   In the enforcement of this chapter, the Sheriff's Department Commander
or his designated employees may enter upon private property for the purposes
specified in the ordinance to examine a vehicle or parts thereof, obtain
information as to the identity of a vehicle, and remove or cause the removal of
a vehicle or part thereof declared a nuisance pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   When the City Council has contracted with or granted a franchise to
any person or persons for the abatement of abandoned vehicles, such person or
persons shall be authorized to enter upon private property to remove or cause
the removal of a vehicle or parts declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this
chapter.

Statutory reference:
   Authority, see Cal. Veh. Code § 22663
§ 90.07 ABANDONED VEHICLES ON PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (A)   Upon discovery on public or private property, excluding a highway, of
an abandoned vehicle or a vehicle which lacks an engine, transmission, wheels,
tires, doors, windshield, or other major part or equipment necessary to operate
safely on the highway, the Sheriff's Department Commander shall have the
authority to cause the abatement and removal of said vehicle in accordance with
the procedure prescribed in the section.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided by law or this chapter, not less than a
ten-day notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or part thereof as
a public nuisance shall be issued for a vehicle abandoned on public or private
property, excluding a highway, unless the property owner and the owner of the
vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest
in the vehicle or part thereof, except as provided in Cal. Veh. Code § 22661
(c).
   (C)   The 10-day notice of intention to abate and remove a vehicle or part
thereof, when required by this chapter, shall contain a statement of hearing
rights of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located and of the
owner of the vehicle. The statement shall include notice to the property owner
that he (or she) may appear in person at a hearing or may submit a sworn
written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the
land, with his (or her) reason for such denial, in lieu of appearing. The
notice of intention to abate shall be mailed, by registered or certified mail,
to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to
the last registered and legal owners of record unless the vehicle is in such
condition that the identification numbers are not available to determine
ownership.
   (D)   A request for a hearing shall be made to the Sheriff's Department
Commander within ten days after the mailing of notice of intention to abate and
remove the vehicle or at the time of signing a release.
   (E)   Upon a request for hearing by the owner of the vehicle or the owner of
the land upon which such vehicle is located, a public hearing shall be held

public body, agency, or officer shall have the authority to remove the vehicle.
   (G)   The Sheriff's Department Commander or his designee shall hear all
facts and testimony it deems pertinent. The facts and testimony may include
testimony on the condition of the vehicle or parts, and the circumstances
concerning its location on the private property or public property. The
Sheriff's Department Commander or his designee shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence.
   (H)   The owner of the land on which the vehicle is located is authorized to
appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his (or her)
reason for such denial.
   (I)   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
land without the consent of the landowner and that he (or she) has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, then the local authority shall not
assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property
on which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such cost from
the owner.
   (J)   If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a
sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle
on his (or her) land within such time period, this statement shall be construed
as request for hearing which does not require the presence of the owner
submitting such request.
   (K)   The Sheriff's Department Commander or his designee may impose such
conditions and take such other action as it seems appropriate under the
circumstances to carry out the purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time
for removal of the vehicle, or parts, if, in its opinion, the circumstances
justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Sheriff's Department
Commander or his designee may find that a vehicle, or parts, has been
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or is inoperative on private or public property
and order the same be removed from the property as a public nuisance and
disposed of as provided in this chapter and determine the administrative costs
and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order
requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or parts and
correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available.
   (L)   Any interested party may appeal the decision of the Sheriff's
Department Commander or his designee by filing a written notice of appeal with
the City Council within five days after his decision. Such appeal shall be
heard by the City Council which may affirm, amend or reverse the order or take
other action deemed appropriate. The clerk shall give written notice of the
time and place of the hearing to the appellant, to the owner of the land, and
the owner of the vehicle. In conducting the hearing, the City Council shall not
be limited by the technical rules of evidence.
   (M)   This section shall not apply to a vehicle or part thereof which is
completely enclosed within a building in a lawful manner where it is not
visible from the street or other public or private property or a vehicle or
part thereof which is stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property
in connection with the business of a licensed vehicle dealer, or junk yard.

plan. The Director of Finance or designee will have the discretion to determine
if it is feasible to do so, and may request documentary evidence to make a

special service. The processing fee will be set by resolution, and is subject

by City Council resolution, shall be charged.
      (2)   Deposit. The citee must pay a deposit equal to half of the full
amount of the fine indicated on the citation on or before the request for a
hearing is filed; failure to deposit half of the amount of all fines appealed
within the 30-day filing period, shall constitute the request for an appeal
hearing incomplete and untimely and therefore not accepted.
      (3)   Failure to timely file an appeal hearing request form with the City
Clerk, along with the filing fee, if required, and deposit shall constitute a
waiver of the right to any appeal hearing, and the citation shall be deemed
confirmed and final.

party establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance or designee,
by means of tax returns, pay stubs or other similar documentary evidence, and
submits a declaration under penalty of perjury that paying the filing fee and/
or deposit amount would cause undue financial hardship to the appealing party,
the Director of Finance or designee may grant a waiver of the filing fee, and/
or waiver or reduction of the deposit amount required. The Director of
Finance's determination is not appealable and shall be final as to the hardship
waiver request.
   (B)   Hearing body. The appeal shall be heard by an Appeals Board. The
Planning Commission, in accordance with §
32.35(F) of this Code of Ordinances, shall act as the Appeals Board. Members of
the Appeals Board shall not have had any responsibility for the investigation,
prosecution or enforcement of nuisances under this chapter and shall not have

will notify all persons in writing indicating the date, time, and place to
appear for their scheduled appeal hearing, and include a notice to their right
to appeal to the City Council and the number of days to do so. First Class Mail
or e-mail service of this notice is deemed complete at the time sent.
      (3)   The failure of an appellant to receive a properly addressed notice
shall not invalidate the citation or any hearing, city action or proceeding,
which is conducted pursuant to this chapter.
      (4)   The City Clerk shall notify the Code Enforcement staff of the filed
appeal request; who shall then submit copies of any documentation to the City
Clerk of the administrative citation(s), fines, and reasons for issuance.
      (5)   The hearing will be conducted within 60 days of the date that a
timely and complete appeal request is received by the City Clerk. However, this
time may be extended due to the constraints posed by the Planning Commission’s
meeting schedule.

for administrative appeal hearings in accordance with the procedures

at the requesting party's own expense.
      (6)   Burden of proof. The accuracy of the notice and order containing
the description of the violations and/or public nuisance and the actions
required to abate such nuisance or violation is deemed a rebuttable presumption
and the burden is on the appellant to provide such facts and information to
overcome such presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.

departments.
   (G)   Hearing decision.
      (1)   After consideration of all testimony and evidence submitted at the

and reasons, within seven business days to the appellant, and include the

hardship. A payment plan will include a payment processing fee to cover costs
for this special service. The processing fee will be set by resolution, and is
subject to change from time to time by the City Council.

application with the enforcement officer for a noise permit to vary from strict
compliance with any particular provisions of this chapter where such noise
permit will not result in a hazardous condition or a nuisance and strict
compliance would be unreasonable in view of all circumstances. The owner or
operator shall set forth all actions taken to comply with such provisions and
the reasons why immediate compliance cannot be achieved. A separate application
shall be filed for each noise source, provided, however, that several mobile
sources under common ownership or fixed sources under common ownership on a

imposed which may include restriction on noise level, noise duration and
operating hours, an approved method of achieving compliance and a time schedule
for its implementation. The decision of the enforcement officer is subject to
appeal to the City Council for a public hearing by filing a written appeal with
the enforcement officer not later than 15 days following the date of the
enforcement officer's written decision to the applicant.
   (C)   Factors which the enforcement officer or the City Council must
consider shall include but not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Present and potential uses of property within the area affected by
noise;

the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk. The City
Council shall either affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Enforcement
Officer. Such decisions shall be final and shall be based upon the
considerations set forth in this section.

   For the purposes of this chapter the following terms, phrases, and words
shall have the meaning given herein:
   APPROVED TREES. Means trees planted and growing in accordance with the
street tree plan, both as to variety and location. All other street trees shall
be known as “nonconforming trees.”

The locations herein referred to shall be known as “street tree areas.”
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.03 STREET TREE PLAN.
   (A)   The Development Services Department may prepare a street tree plan
specifying a list of approved street trees, a uniform method of street tree
planning, and designating certain streets or blocks of certain specimens of
trees, plants or shrubs. The street tree plan shall subsequently be reviewed by
the Planning Commission.
   (B)   The plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission and after
adoption of the plan, as submitted or modified, in accordance with law it shall
become the street tree plan of the city.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.04 PLAN ADMINISTRATION.
   The City Manager shall have the authority and powers to administer the
street tree program in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.05 AUTHORITY OF CITY MANAGER.
   The City Manager shall have the authority to order any work to prune, trim,
clip, spray, maintain and care for street trees, or private trees to the extent
that they overhang or project within public rights-of-way, or public roads of
the city, as needed, to remove or require the removal by the owner of the
adjoining property of diseased or dead trees, and encourage planting of
approved trees throughout the city. The City Manager shall also have the
authority to deviate from the designated tree for each block if circumstances
warrant. Street tree pruning and tree removals shall be done in accordance with
the street tree policy approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.06 PLANTING GENERALLY.
   (A)   Upon the adoption of a street tree plan, all street trees shall
hereafter be planted in accordance therewith and the provisions of this
chapter. At the property owner’s request and cost, the city will remove and
replace existing, non-conforming street trees with an approved tree.
   (B)   Each interior residential lot shall have at least one approved street
tree. Each corner residential lot shall have at least two approved street
trees. The City Manager may, in his or her discretion, approve a greater or
lesser number of trees per lot, upon a review of the circumstances.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.07 PERMITS REQUIRED.
   (A)   It is unlawful for any person to remove, damage, prune, or encroach
upon, or cause to be removed, damaged, pruned, or encroached upon any street
tree without first having obtained a permit from the Public Works Department.
Said permit shall be issued only for work to be done in compliance with the
street tree plan and this chapter. The City Council may establish and set from
time to time a fee for such permits. All work done pursuant to a permit shall
be completed under the supervision of the Public Works Department. Whenever any
street tree, whether approved or nonconforming, is removed or needs replacing,
it must be replaced with a tree approved for that specific street tree area in
accordance with the street tree plan and the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager shall issue to any
person doing business as a public utility, subject to the jurisdiction of the
California Public Utilities Commission and holding a valid franchise, a permit
which shall authorize the cutting or removal of trees necessary for the safety
and proper maintenance of said utilities service pursuant to the orders, rules
and regulations of said California Public Utilities Commission. Such a permit,
unless renewed, shall expire at the end of one year after the date of issuance,
or it may be revoked for good cause. Even with a valid permit, utilities are
prohibited from topping street trees. Directional pruning or other ISA-approved
methods are allowed. The city’s pruning guidelines are contained in the city’s
street tree pruning policy.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.08 ABUSING OR MUTILATING TREES PROHIBITED.
   No person shall abuse, destroy or mutilate any street tree. Topping, severe
pruning, or other inappropriate pruning techniques shall be considered
mutilation. Directional pruning or other ISA-approved methods of pruning are
allowed and do not constitute mutilation. Any such harm to street trees
constitutes an immediate hazard to the public health, safety and welfare of the
community and a public nuisance. Upon notice by the city, any person who
violates the provisions of this section to the extent that the street tree must
be removed or replaced, shall remove and replace the tree to the specifications
of the street tree plan and the provisions of this chapter at their own
expense. At the owner’s request and cost, the city may provide a tree to the
property owner who shall be responsible for all planting and associated work.

§ 96.09 OPEN GROUND MAINTENANCE.
   No person shall place or maintain any stone, cement, or other substance as
to impede the free access of water or air to the roots of any street tree; not
less than twelve square feet of open ground shall be left and maintained around
every street tree.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.10 INTERFERENCE PROHIBITED.
   No person shall in any way interfere with the City Manager, other city
employees, or their contractors while they are lawfully engaged in planting,
mulching, pruning, trimming, spraying, treating or removing any street tree, or
in removing any stone, cement or other substance from the trunk of any street
tree or the surrounding open ground area.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.11 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION NECESSITATING, ALTERING, OR REMOVING TREE; PERMIT
AND DEPOSIT REQUIRED.
   A written permit issued by the Public Works Department shall be obtained
when the erection, repair, alteration or removal of any building, house or
structure necessitates the trimming, pruning, or removal of any street tree.
The City Council shall set from time to time by resolution a permit fee for
such permits. As a condition to a permit granted pursuant to this section, the
applicant shall deposit a security with the city, in an amount to be determined
by the City Manager, sufficient to defray the cost of replacing the removed
tree with an approved tree in conformance with the street tree plan.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.12 PRIVATE TREE MAINTENANCE; FAILURE A NUISANCE; NOTICE.
   No person shall allow or maintain any tree on private property in such a way
that creates a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic by obstructing vision
or impairing necessary clearance, or in any manner endangering the security or
usefulness of any public street, sewer, sidewalk, or other public property. Any
such private tree allowed or maintained contrary to the provisions of this
section is a public nuisance; upon a determination by the City Manager that
such private tree constitutes a nuisance, he shall give written notice to the
owner of the property upon which said nuisance exists to trim, remove, or
otherwise control such tree in such a manner as will abate such nuisance.
Failure to comply with such written notice within ten days thereafter is a
violation of this section. Such written notice may be given by a personal
service of a copy thereof, or by placing a copy of the notice in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the owner of the property as shown
by the last assessment roll of the city.

proposed plan of street tree planting showing the location and variety of trees
proposed to be planted in the subdivision, or shall request the Planning
Commission to designate the type and location of street trees for such
subdivision before approval of the final subdivision map.
   (B)   Subdividers are required to deposit a security, to be determined by
the City Manager, sufficient to cover the cost of the number and variety of
trees needed as determined by the Development Services Department for planting
street trees within their subdivisions. Prior to the approval of the final
subdivision map by the City Council, the deposit shall have been either paid or
guaranteed by the subdividers bond.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.14 EMERGENCY SITUATIONS; PUBLIC UTILITIES MAY TRIM WITHOUT PERMIT.
   Public utilities providing gas, water, electric, telephone or telegraph
service to residents of the city may, in those emergency cases where street
trees are interrupting the service, trim or remove branches of the trees to the
extent necessary to restore services without securing a permit. However, once
the emergency situation has been corrected, the public utility must finish the
trimming through the use of directional pruning, v-pruning or other approved
methods to leave the tree with a correct structure and a balanced shape.
(Ord. 2017-005, passed 4-11-17)
§ 96.15 CHANGING THE VARIETY OF APPROVED TREES; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   In the event that any approved trees become subject to pests or
otherwise unsuitable as street trees, the owners of not less than 50% of the
front footage on any block and not less than 50% of the frontage of the block
facing the same on the opposite side of the street may apply to the Planning
Commission for change in the variety of approved trees on such block. “Block”
means the block fronting on any street between cross streets. The Planning
Commission shall schedule and conduct a hearing upon receipt of such notice. At
least ten days prior to the hearing, the City Clerk shall provide
written notice of the hearing to the owners of lands on the block to be
affected by such proposed change by mail to the addresses shown on the current
assessment roll and may publish a notice of the hearing at least once in a
newspaper published in the city. At the hearing the Planning Commission shall
hear the evidence presented and shall take into consideration the effect of the
change on the general tree planting program of the city. The Planning
Commission shall issue a written decision, which the City Clerk shall be mail
to all affected property owners as defined herein.
   (B)   Any person dissatisfied with the decision of the Planning Commission
may appeal the same to the City Council within ten days after notice of such
decision. The City Council shall consider such appeal at its next regular

final.

private property from the duty to keep any tree, shrub, or plant upon any
street tree area on his property or under his control in such condition as to
prevent it from constituting a hazard or an impediment to travel or vision upon

administrative citation and/or a notice and order has not been issued against
the same premises, or the same property owner but at a different premise,
address or location, within the city, within the last 12 months, and that the

presented by the recipient.
(Ord. 2008-016, passed 1-12-09)
§ 98.15 STOP WORK ORDER.

shall be served either by personal delivery or by First Class U.S. mail,
postage prepaid, upon the record owner at the address as it appears on the
latest equalized assessment roll of Stanislaus County, and upon the occupant of
the premises, if any. If neither of these methods result in the notice being
served upon the record owner and any occupants after reasonable attempts to
serve, a copy of the notice shall be posted on the premises.
(Ord. 2008-016, passed 1-12-09)
§ 98.17 NOTICE AND ORDER.
   Notice and orders are primarily used for structural or technical code
violations such as illegal construction, conversions, alterations, illegal
plumbing, mechanical or electrical installations, dangerous buildings, sub-
standard housing or similar. When issued, the violation must be remedied in 30
calendar days, unless there is an immediate danger risk. If there is an eminent
threat of danger the violation must be remedied immediately.
   (A)   Grounds for issuance. A notice and order may be issued under any of
the following circumstances:
      (1)   When a notice of violation has been served, and the specified time
has passed without adequate correction and abatement of the violation;
      (2)   When a stop work order has been issued but has not been complied
with;
      (3)   When the city has performed a summary abatement pursuant to this
chapter;
      (4)   When the same type or character of violation has been committed by
the same person, or on the same premises, or a notice of violation, an
administrative citation, or a notice and order has been served on the same
person, or on the same premises, within the past 12 months.
   (B)   Contents of notice and order. A notice and order shall contain the
following:
      (1)   The name and address of the person, corporation, or entity in
violation, and the street address of the property where the violation is

violation and nuisance;
      (5)   A statement informing the recipient of his or her right to appeal
the determination to Planning Commission by filing with the Community
Development Department within ten calendar days from the date of the notice and
order, and on a form available from the Community Development Department, a
written statement requesting a hearing and providing a factual and specific
explanation of: why the premises should not be declared to be a public nuisance
and abated; and why the costs of such abatement should not become a special
assessment lien against the premises;
      (6)   A statement that if the person, corporation or entity fails to
abate the violation and nuisance or fails to file on a timely basis a request
for an appeal hearing, the notice and order shall be final and not subject to
judicial review, and all persons served with such notice shall be deemed to
have consented to the abatement of the nuisance and that, at the election of
the city, the city will abate the nuisance and the costs of such abatement may
be charged against the premises and may be recorded as a special assessment
lien against the premises; and
   (C)   Service of notice and order.
      (1)   Persons entitled to service. The notice and order shall be served
upon the owner of the premises, any occupants of the premises, and any other
person, corporation, or entity in violation. If the city proposes to impose a
special assessment lien on the property, the city official issuing the notice
and order shall also serve one copy on each of the following if known or
disclosed from official public records: the holder of any mortgage, deed of
trust, or other encumbrance of record; and the owner or holder of any lease of
record. The failure of the city official issuing the order to serve any person
required to be served shall not invalidate any proceedings under this chapter
or relieve any person who was duly served from any duty or obligation imposed
on him by the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Method of service. Unless otherwise provided in this section,
service of a notice and order shall be made by personal service or by First
Class U.S. mail, postage prepaid with confirmation of delivery by the U.S.
Postal Service. Service on any property owner in violation is deemed complete
when it is served or delivered at the address listed by the property owner on
the latest equalized assessment roll of Stanislaus County, or as known to the
city official issuing the order. If personal service or service by mail with
confirmation of delivery is not reasonably feasible, service of the notice and
order may be made by posting the notice on the subject premises and sending a
copy by regular United States mail service. Service posting in the manner
herein provided shall be effective on the date of posting. As an alternative,
substituted service of the notice and order may be made as follows:
         (a)   1.   By leaving a copy during usual business hours at the
recipient's business with the person who is apparently in charge, and then
mailing a copy by first class mail to the recipient at the address where the
copy was left; or
            2.   By leaving a copy at the recipient's dwelling or usual place
of abode, in the presence of a competent member of the household, and then
mailing a copy by first class mail to the recipient at the address where the
copy was left.
         (b)   If the party entitled to service has a property manager or
rental agency overseeing the premises, substituted service may be made as set
forth above upon the property manager or rental agency.
         (c)   Substituted service may be made by posting the notice and order
on the premises and mailing a copy of the notice and order to the person,
corporation, or entity in violation at the address of the property on which the
violation has occurred or is occurring.
         (d)   If the person, corporation, or entity in violation or other
person entitled to service cannot be located or service cannot be made as set
forth in this section, service may be made by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City of Riverbank. Service shall be deemed
sufficient when it is accomplished pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 6063.
   (D)   Preparation of a record of the proceeding shall be governed by
California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.6, as presently written or
hereinafter amended.
(Ord. 2008-016, passed 1-12-09)
§ 98.18 APPEAL HEARING; NOTICE AND ORDER.
   (A)   Payment of appeal fee.
      (1)   Any person, corporation, or entity seeking to appeal a notice and
order shall be required to pay to the city, at the time the appeal is
requested, a nonrefundable appeal fee to be set by resolution of the City
Council. The appeal fee is intended to cover the costs, expenses, and city
employees' time incurred by the city in processing, preparing for, and hearing
of the appeal. No appeal request is valid unless accompanied by the appeal fee
or a city hardship waiver is granted.
      (2)   Hardship waiver. If the appealing party establishes to the
satisfaction of the Director of Finance or designee, by means of tax returns,
pay stubs or other similar documentary evidence, and submits a declaration
under penalty of perjury that paying the appeal fee would cause undue financial
hardship to the appealing party, the Director of Finance may grant a waiver of
the appeal fee. The Director of Finance's determination is not appealable and
shall be final as to the hardship waiver request.
   (B)   Hearing body. The appeal shall be heard by an Appeals Board. The
Planning Commission, in accordance with §
32.35(F) of this Code of Ordinances, shall act as the Appeals Board. Members of
the Appeals Board shall not have had any responsibility for the investigation,
prosecution or enforcement of nuisances under this chapter and shall not have
had any personal involvement in the appeal to be heard within the past 12
months.
   (C)   Setting appeal hearing. The Appeal Board hearing shall be set in
accordance with the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting, but shall
be opened as a separate and distinct body. The notice of the appeal hearing
shall be sent to the appellant by first class mail at the address provided with
the written appeal request. The appeal hearing shall be set for a date no
sooner than 20 days following a request for an appeal hearing. Notice of the
appeal hearing shall be mailed at least 15 days before the date set for
hearing.
   (D)   Conduct of appeal hearing.
      (1)   Testimony at the hearing. At the time set for the appeal hearing,
the Appeals Board shall proceed to hear testimony from the representative of
the city, the appellant, and any other competent persons with respect to the
determination of a violation and nuisance or the imposition of an
administrative penalty.
      (2)   Record of oral evidence at hearing. The proceedings at the hearing
shall be reported by a tape recording. Either party may provide a certified
shorthand reporter to maintain a record of the proceedings at the requesting
party's own expense.
      (3)   Continuances. The Chairperson of the Appeals Board may, upon
request of the person, corporation, or entity against whom a penalty is to be
imposed, or upon request of the city, grant continuances from time to time for
extreme or unusual cause shown, or upon the Appeals Board's own motion.
      (4)   Oaths; certification. The Chairperson of the Appeals Board or
certified shorthand reporter shall administer the oath or affirmation.
      (5)   Evidence rules. Cal. Gov't Code § 11513(a), (b), and (c) shall
apply to all administrative hearings. At the Appeals Board Chairperson's sole
discretion, other relevant evidence may be admissible and hearsay evidence may
be used for the purpose of supplementing and explaining other evidence.
      (6)   Burden of proof. The accuracy of the notice and order containing
the description of the violations and/or public nuisance and the actions
required to abate such nuisance or violation is deemed a rebuttable presumption
and the burden is on the appellant to provide such facts and information to
overcome such presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.
      (7)   Rights of parties.
         (a)   Each party shall have the following rights among others: To call
and examine witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues of the hearing; to
introduce documentary and physical evidence; to cross-examine opposing
witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues of the hearing; to impeach any
witness regardless of which party first called that witness to testify; to
rebut the evidence against him or her; to represent himself or herself or to be
represented by anyone of his or her choice.
         (b)   If a party does not proficiently speak or understand the English
language, that party may provide an interpreter, at that party's own cost, to
translate for the party. An interpreter shall not have been a resident of the
premises or have had any personal relationship with or involvement in the
parties or issues of the case prior to the hearing.
      (8)   Official notice. In reaching a decision, the Appeals Board may take
official notice, either before or after submission of the case for decision, of
any fact which may be judicially noticed by the courts of this state or which
may appear in any of the official records of the city or county or any of their
departments.
      (9)   Inspection of the premises.
         (a)   An Appeals Board member may inspect the premises involved in the
hearing prior to, during, or after the hearing, provided that: Notice of such
inspection shall be given to the parties before the inspection is made; the
parties consent and are given an opportunity to be present during the
inspection; and the Appeals Board member shall state for the record during the
hearing, or file a written statement after the hearing for inclusion in the
hearing record, upon completion of the inspection, the material facts observed
and the conclusions drawn there from.
         (b)   Each party shall then have a right to rebut or explain the
matters so stated by the Appeals Board member either for the record during the
hearing or by filing a written statement after the hearing for inclusion in the
hearing record.
         (c)   Notice to the parties or the owners' consent to inspect the
building and surrounding properties is not required if the property can be
inspected from areas in which the general public has access or with permission
of the other persons authorized to provide access to the property on which the
building is located.
   (E)   Form and contents of the decision; finality of decision.
      (1)   Format of Appeals Board decision. The Appeals Board shall issue a
written decision containing findings of fact and a determination of the issues
presented. The Appeals Board may affirm or reverse the notice of violation or
the notice and order imposed by the city. The Appeals Board may not reduce,
waive or conditionally reduce the fines established by the city.
      (2)   Contents of Appeals Board's decision. If it is shown by a
preponderance of all the evidence that the condition of the premises
constitutes a violation of the Riverbank Code of Ordinances or is a public
nuisance as defined in this chapter, the decision shall declare the premises to
be a public nuisance and shall order and require the appellant to abate the
nuisance not later than ten calendar days after the issuance of the decision
or, if ten calendar days is insufficient to abate the nuisance, within such
other time as specified by the Appeals Board not to exceed 60 days. The
decision shall inform the appellant that if the nuisance is not abated within
the time specified, the nuisance may be abated by the city in such manner as
may be ordered by the department head and the expense thereof made a special
assessment lien upon the property involved. This is in addition to any other
legal remedies that the city may choose to compel compliance.
      (3)   Service of the Appeals Board's decision. Upon issuance of the
decision, the city shall serve a copy on the appellant by first class mail to
the address provided by appellant in the written notice of appeal. The Appeals
Board's decision shall be deemed served three days after the date it is mailed
to the address provided by the appellant.
      (4)   Finality of appeal's decision. The decision of the Appeals Board on
an appeal of a notice and order may be appealed to the City Council pursuant to
§

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 112.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALLOWABLE ELECTRONIC BINGO AID. An electronic device which satisfies the
following criteria:
      (1)   An electronic bingo aid must function primarily as an electronic
aid or labor saving device that requires some interaction between the player
and the device, but where the numbers are drawn independently and apart from
the device, and the device can only be utilized in a common bingo game along
with other players competing for a common, preannounced prize;
      (2)   In addition to being tested and approved, an electronic bingo aid
must provide for accountability, integrity, security and fairness of the game.
As such all electronic cards in play during any bingo game must be fully
accounted for at any time during and after the game by an independent
accounting means and must be fully verifiable at any time by an independent
verification means;
      (3)   Electronic cards available to players shall be part of a
predetermined deck, group or series of cards, no two of which shall be alike,
and electronic cards shall not be arranged or distributed so as to give any
player preference to any particular card. All cards must have an equal chance
of winning;
      (4)   In order to insure the integrity and fairness, the electronic aid
shall preclude any unauthorized transfer or substitution of electronic cards
during (after the start of) any bingo game;
      (5)   As the primary function of the system must be to assist the bingo
player as he/she plays bingo, the system must not generate the bingo numbers
utilized in the game. Upon the player calling “bingo”, the player's winning
card must be simultaneously displayed to all players playing bingo to allow all
players the opportunity to verify the winning card;
      (6)   The particular arrangement of numbers required to win a particular
game shall be clearly displayed on or through the electronic aid before the
start of the game without the necessity of any player action or inaction; and
      (7)   The called bingo numbers must be presented on the electronic aid as
they are announced by the bingo caller without the necessity for any player
action or inaction.
   BINGO. A game of chance in which each player receives a bingo card, either
paper, hard card, or electronic representation thereof. Each bingo card,
whether paper card, hard card or electronic representation thereof, is defined
as a series of five vertical rows of five predetermined numbers ranging from 1
through 75. Numbers are drawn or otherwise obtained by chance, from a set of
consecutively numbered balls of essentially equal size, weight, and shape, and
publicly displayed or otherwise publicly made known. The player first having a
specified patterned of announced numbers appearing on his/her card, upon
verification by an authorized person and/or through electronic or computer
verification means or otherwise, shall be declared the winner. No electronic
generation of numbers is permitted in any bingo game allowed under this
chapter.
   BINGO EQUIPMENT. The receptacle from which the numbered objects (bingo
balls) are drawn, the display board upon which the numbered objects are
displayed, the master board or bingo rack upon which the numbered objects are
placed upon being drawn, bingo cards (electronic representations or otherwise),
and any and all computer and/or electronic systems which are utilized as
electronic aids in playing and verifying bingo, and any and all other articles
essential to the operation, conduct, and playing of bingo.

§ 113.015 FRANCHISE TO OPERATE.
   (A)   Grant. Subject to applicable state and federal law, a nonexclusive
franchise to construct, operate and maintain a cable system within all or any
portion of the city may be granted by the Council to any person or entity,
whether currently operating under an existing franchise or not, who or which
offers to furnish and provide such services pursuant to the terms of this
chapter.
   (B)   Limitation. No provision of this chapter may be deemed or construed as
to require the granting of a franchise when in the opinion of the Council it is
in the public interest to restrict the number of grantees to one or more.
   (C)   Use of public streets and highways. Any such franchise shall authorize
and permit the grantee to engage in the business of operating and providing a
cable system in the city, and for that purpose to erect, install, construct,
repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, over, under, upon,
across, and along any public street or highway within the area of the
franchise, such poles, wires, cable, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults,
manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments, and other property as
may be necessary and appurtenant to the cable system; and in addition, so to
use, operate, and provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased
from other persons, firms or corporations, including but not limited to any
public utility or other grantee franchises or permitted to do business in the
area of the franchise.
(Ord. 94-09, passed 9-12-94)
§ 113.016 DURATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Duration. No franchise granted by the Council under this chapter shall
be for a term longer than 15 years following the effective date (as herein
defined) of such franchise or any renewal thereof.
   (B)   Effective date. The effective date of the franchise shall be the date
on which the franchise agreement has been executed or the date on which the
resolution of the Council approving the execution of the franchise becomes
effective, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing, city and the
grantee may agree on a specific effective date in the franchise agreement,
which shall thereafter be binding on the parties.
   (C)   Termination. The franchise shall terminate without further action by
the city at the end of the term, provided, however, that the city, at or before
the end of the term, retains the exclusive power to grant an extension, or a
renewal of the franchise to grantee. Any termination or revocation of the
franchise prior to its terms shall be executed in accordance with 47 USC 547.
   (D)   Franchise renewal. The renewal procedure specified in 47 USC 546
shall, if the grantee requests, be commenced by the city during the six month
period which begins three years prior to the expiration of the term of the
franchise. Any such renewal shall also be subject to the requirements of
§ 113.019 hereunder, which relate to the application for a franchise.
(Ord. 94-09, passed 9-12-94)
§ 113.017 FRANCHISE PAYMENTS.
   (A)   Franchise fee.
      (1)   Any grantee shall pay to the city, during the life of the
franchise, a sum equal to 5% of the gross quarterly receipts of the grantee,
provided, however, that in no event shall the franchise fee for any 12-month
period ever exceed 5% of the sum of the grantee's gross quarterly receipts for
such period. Grantee shall also pay to the city when due such other sums as may
be provided for in the franchise agreement. In no event shall the fee be more
than that authorized by applicable federal and state law. Such fee by the
grantee to the city shall be payable on or before the thirtieth day following
the end of each respective calendar quarter during the term of the franchise,
by delivery of the same to the City Clerk. All payments made hereunder shall be
made in lieu of any business license, occupation tax or similar levy.
      (2)   In the event that the above payments and financial statements are
not received by the city within ten days of the specified due dates, grantee
shall pay to the city a late charge to cover administrative, bookkeeping and
other expenses attendant thereto, of 2% of the amount due for such calendar
quarter plus interest at the rate of 10% per annum on any late payment computed
from the date due to the date of payment.
   (B)   Financial statement. The grantee shall file with the city, within 60
days after the expiration of any calendar year (or portion thereof) during
which such franchise is in force, a financial statement prepared by an
independent certified public accountant who is satisfactory to the Council and
certified by the chief financial officer of the grantee, showing receipts of
grantee during the calendar quarters (or portion thereof in the case of an
initial or final quarter) in the preceding calendar year.
   (C)   Inspection; audit. Upon written request made at least seven days in
advance during normal business hours, any duly authorized representative of the
city shall have the right to inspect and audit the grantee's records showing
the gross quarterly receipts from which its franchise fee payments are
computed. Any such inspection or audit shall take place within 36 months
following the respective month and records thereof in question. If an
underpayment in excess of 5% of the franchise fee for any calendar quarter is
determined in such inspection or audit conducted by or at the direction of the
city, then the cost of such inspection or audit shall be borne by the grantee.
   (D)   Acceptance by city. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as
a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim that the city may have
for any sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other
obligation hereunder.
(Ord. 94-09, passed 9-12-94)
§ 113.018 LIMITATIONS OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Nonexclusive. Any franchise granted under this chapter shall be
nonexclusive.
   (B)   Exemptions. No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred by
any franchise except those specifically prescribed herein, in the franchise
agreement or as subsequently determined by the Council and expressed by
resolution.
   (C)   Subordination. Any privilege claimed under any franchise by the
grantee in any public street or other public property shall be subordinate to
any prior lawful occupancy of the streets or other public property.
   (D)   Transfer.
      (1)   Any franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held in
personal trust by the original grantee. Neither the franchise, nor any rights
or obligations of the grantee pursuant to the franchise or cable system shall
be transferred in part or as a whole, by assignment, trust, mortgage, lease,
sublease, pledge or other hypothecation or by forced or involuntary sale, or by
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, nor shall the title to the
franchise or system, either legal or equitable, or any right or interest
therein, pass to or vest in any person or entity, nor shall a change in control
(20% or more) of grantee occur, either by act of the grantee, by operation of
law or otherwise, in each case, without the prior consent of the Council
expressed by resolution, and then only under such conditions as may therein be
prescribed. The consent of the Council may not be unreasonably withheld,
provided, however, that any proposed assignee must show complete financial and
technical ability to operate a franchise hereunder and must agree to comply
with all provisions of this chapter and any preexisting agreements between the
city and grantee.
      (2)   Nothing contained in this division (D) shall be deemed to prohibit
or require city approval of any assignment, pledge, lease, sublease, mortgage,
or other transfer or hypothecation of all or any part of the stock of (or other
evidence if ownership in) or assets (not including the franchise) of the
company or the system, or any right or interest therein, for securing an
indebtedness, provided that each such assignment, pledge, lease, sublease,
mortgage, or other transfer or hypothecation shall be subject to the rights of
the city pursuant to this agreement, or applicable law, and such rights of the
city shall be recognized in each such hypothecation agreement between grantee
and any such creditor.
      (3)   The restrictions contained in this division (D) shall not apply to
any transfer or hypothecation, assignment, or other disposition, between or
among persons in common control with the grantee, provided that in such
instances or any other instances where any change in the ownership of grantee
is to be undertaken, prior written notice of any such change shall be provided
to the city.
      (4)   A grantee shall file written notice with the city as soon as it
acquires knowledge of any impending transaction or other event for which the
consent of the city is required under this division (D). The notice shall state
the name and address of the interested parties in the transaction, and enclose
a copy of any executed agreement between the interested parties. Furthermore,
the grantee shall agree to provide any and all information and documentation as
may be reasonably requested by the city in connection with its review of any
proposed transfer. By its acceptance of the franchise, the grantee agrees that
any such acquisition occurring without prior approval of the city shall
constitute a violation of the franchise by grantee.
      (5)   Any such transfer shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of
the city under any franchise agreement granted hereunder, and the transferee
shall acknowledge in writing such subordination and agreement to comply with
and be bound by all of the terms, conditions, and requirements of the franchise
agreement, as well as this chapter.
   (E)   Time of the essence. Time shall be of the essence of any franchise.
The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply promptly with any
of the provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement, by any failure of
the city to enforce prompt compliance.
   (F)   City right of transfer. Any right or power in, or duty impressed upon,
any officer, employee, department, or board of the city may be transferred at
any time by the city to any other officer, employee, department, or board of
the city.
   (G)   Legal compliance. The grantee shall comply with all federal, state,
city and local laws as now or hereafter enacted during the term of the
franchise. Copies of all petitions and applications concerning the franchise
submitted by the grantee to the Federal Communications Commission, Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other federal or state regulatory commission or
agency having appropriate jurisdiction shall also be contemporaneously
submitted to the City Clerk.
   (H)   Pole attachments. Franchises granted under this chapter shall not
relieve the grantee of any obligation involved in obtaining pole space from any
department of the city, utility company, or from others maintaining utility
poles.
   (I)   Private property. Except as otherwise provided by law, the granting of
a franchise shall not be construed as permission or authority to enter on,
occupy, or otherwise use any private property without the express consent of
the owner or agent in possession thereof.
(Ord. 94-09, passed 9-12-94)
§ 113.019 APPLICATION FOR FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Procedures.Application for a franchise hereunder or any renewal
thereof shall be in writing accompanied by an application fee of $10,000, and
be filed with the city. Notice of intent to renew under the Cable Act shall not
be deemed to be an application for a renewal. The application fee shall be for
ordinary and reasonable costs which the city will incur in connection with the
preparation of an ordinance, related agreements or any renewal thereof. To the
extent allowed by law, such fee shall be within the exclusion to the term
“franchise fee” as defined in 47 USC 542(g)(2) and shall not be deemed to be
part of the franchise fee obligations of grantee pursuant to
§ 113.017(A) hereof. Application for a franchise hereunder shall contain, at
option of the city, the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the applicant. If the applicant is a

the applicant is a corporation, the application shall also state the names and
addresses of its directors, executive officers, major stockholders, and the
names and addresses of parent and subsidiary companies.
      (2)   A statement and description of the cable system proposed to be
constructed, installed, maintained or operated by the applicant; the proposed
location of such system and its various components; the manner in which
applicant proposes to construct, install, maintain and operate the same; and
particularly, the extent and manner in which existing or future poles or other
facilities of other public utilities will be used for such system.
      (3)   A description, in detail, of the streets, public places and
proposed public streets within which applicant proposes or seeks authority to
construct, install or maintain any cable equipment or facilities; a detailed
description of the equipment or facilities proposed to be constructed,
installed or maintained therein; and the proposed specific location thereof.
      (4)   A map specifically showing and delineating the existing and
proposed service area or areas within which applicant proposes to provide cable
services and for which a franchise is requested.
      (5)   A statement or schedule setting forth the number of channels and
all of the television or radio stations proposed to be received, transmitted,
conducted, relayed, or otherwise conveyed over the cable system.
      (6)   A statement or schedule in a form approved by the City Manager of
proposed rates and charges to subscribers for installation and services, and a
copy of the proposed subscription agreement between the grantee and its
subscribers shall accompany the application.
      (7)   A copy of any contract, if existing, between the applicant and any
public utility providing for the use of facilities of such public utility, such
as poles, lines, or conduits.
      (8)   A statement setting forth all agreements and understandings,
whether written, oral or implied, existing between the applicant and any
person, firm or corporation with respect to the proposed franchise or the
proposed cable operation. If a franchise is granted to a person, firm or
corporation posing as a front or as the representative of another person, firm
or corporation and such information is not disclosed in the original
application, such franchise shall be deemed void and of no force and effect
whatsoever.
      (9)   A financial statement prepared by a certified public accountant or
person otherwise satisfactory to the city, showing applicant's financial status
and his financial ability to complete the construction and installation of the
proposed cable system.
      (10)   The city may at any time demand and applicant shall provide such
supplementary, additional or other information as the city may deem reasonably
necessary to determine whether the requested franchise should be granted.
   (B)   Grant to applicant. Upon consideration of any such application, the
Council may refuse to grant the requested franchise or the Council may by
ordinance or resolution grant a franchise for a cable system to any such
applicant as may appear from the application to be in its opinion best
qualified to render proper and efficient cable service to television viewers
and subscribers in the city. The Council's decision in the matter shall be
final. If favorably considered, the application submitted shall constitute and
form part of the franchise as granted.
   (C)   Franchise agreement.
      (1)   Any franchise agreement granted pursuant to this chapter shall
include the following condition:
      “The cable system herein franchised shall be used and operated solely and
exclusively for the purpose expressly authorized by ordinance of the City of
Riverbank and no other purpose whatsoever.”
      (2)   Inclusion of the foregoing statement in any such franchise shall
not be deemed to limit the authority of the city to include any other
reasonable condition, limitation or restriction which it may deem necessary to
impose in connection with such franchise pursuant to the authority conferred by
this chapter.

agreement or grantee's constitutional rights.
(Ord. 94-09, passed 9-12-94)
§ 113.032 ADDITIONAL FRANCHISES.

franchise agreement.

period of time to pass by every single dwelling unit, multiple dwelling unit,
business establishment, public school, hospital, library, law enforcement
station, fire station and all other buildings owned or controlled by the city
within the franchise territory. Such service shall be provided to subscribers
in accordance with the schedules in the franchise agreement and line extension
policies specified in
§ 113.051 herein. Cable system construction and provision of service shall be
non-discriminatory, and shall not delay or defer service to any section of the

where power and telephone utility services are not available.
   (C)   In the franchise agreement, grantee shall provide a detailed
construction plan indicating progress schedule, area construction maps, test

being met and the reasons for any delay.
   (D)   Failure to begin construction within six months after award of the
franchise shall be grounds for immediate franchise termination, at the option
of grantor.

§ 113.049 UNDERGROUNDING.
   (A)   New development undergrounding. In cases of new construction or
property development where utilities are to be placed underground, upon request
by grantee, the developer or property owner shall give grantee reasonable
notice of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for
grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals, or vaults. Grantee shall also
timely provide specifications to the developer and property owner as needed for
trenching. Costs of trenching, installing conduit, and obtaining easements
required to bring service to any development shall be apportioned between
grantee, utility service providers, and the property owner as they may agree
among themselves. Developer shall, however, be primarily responsible for all
costs unless agreed otherwise.
   (B)   Undergrounding at multiple-dwelling units. In cases of utility
services delivered aerially to multiple dwelling units, grantee shall make
every effort to minimize the number of individual aerial drop cables, giving
preference to undergrounding of multiple drop cables between the pole and
dwelling unit.
   (C)   Additional undergrounding.  In those areas and portions of the city
where the transmission or distribution facilities of either the public utility
providing telephone service or those of the utility providing electric service
are already placed or to be placed underground at such utility's cost, subject
to division (A) above, the grantee shall likewise construct, operate and
maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground. For
the purposes of this subsection, “underground” shall include a partial
underground system, such as, streamlining. Amplifiers and other equipment in
grantee's transmission and distribution lines may be placed in appropriate
housings upon the surface of the ground if approved by the Director of Public
Works. The city shall not in any manner be responsible for any costs or
liabilities incurred by grantee in placing grantee's facilities underground or
obtaining any easements therefor.

§ 113.050 SERVICE CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   The grantee shall extend cable service to any premises located in the
service area served by the grantee's energized distribution cable which
requires only the connection of a standard drop or tap to make such service
available, including those premises serviced by underground utilities, at a
standard rate if the owner or occupant of the premises requests such service.
   (B)   If the service connection requires no more than a 250-foot aerial drop
line, the grantee shall provide connection to its service at no charge for the
initial 250 feet, other than the grantee's standard installation fee. The
grantee may charge any new subscriber the maximum amount allowable by law for
that portion of any new aerial service connection in excess of 250 feet, the
length of any new service connections installed underground and the entire
length of any new service connection to remote or relatively inaccessible
subscribers. Prior to installing any service connection for which the grantee
will charge a potential subscriber on a time and material basis, the grantee
must present the prospective subscriber with a written statement of its
estimated costs for the service connection.
(Ord. 94-09, passed 9-12-94)
§ 113.051 LINE EXTENSIONS.
   The grantee shall be required to extend energized trunk cable from any
existing terminus of the cable system to any area within the franchise
territory having a density of at least ten existing and completed dwelling
units within any one-quarter linear mile, provided that the dwelling unit
nearest to the existing terminus of the cable system in such one-quarter linear
mile area is within one-half mile of the existing terminus of the cable system.
Within 30 days after grantee has confirmed the existence of the density
provided above, grantee shall proceed with due diligence to obtain all
necessary permits and authorizations which are required for the extension of
such trunk cable, including any utility joint use agreements and any permits,
licenses and authorizations to be granted by duly constituted regulatory
agencies having jurisdiction over the operation of the cable system. Within 30
days following completion of such line extension construction, the grantee
shall proceed to render service, provided, however, that any such subscriber
requesting service from the extension of the energized trunk cable shall be
subject to the provisions of §
113.050 herein with regard to costs of a tap or drop in excess of 250 feet.
(Ord. 94-09, passed 9-12-94)

alley, public way, or paved area, the grantee shall, at its own cost and
expense and in a manner approved by the Director of Public Works replace and

regulated, designed and provided in accordance with the local Fire District and
building regulations and standards adopted by the city.
   (B)   No adult entertainment business shall be operated in any manner that
permits the observation of any material or activities depicting, describing, or
relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas from any
public way or from any location outside the building or area of the
establishment. This provision shall apply to any display, decoration, sign,
show window or other opening. No exterior door or window on the premises shall
be propped or kept open at any time while the business is open, and any
exterior windows shall be covered with opaque covering at all times.
   (C)   All off-street parking areas and premises entries of the sexually
oriented business shall be illuminated from dusk to closing hours of operation
with a lighting system which provides an average maintained horizontal
illumination of one footcandle of light on the parking surface and/or walkways.
The required lighting level is established in order to provide sufficient
illumination of the parking areas and walkways serving the sexually oriented
business for the personal safety of patrons and employees, and to reduce the
incidence of vandalism and criminal conduct. The lighting shall be shown on the
required sketch or diagram of the premises.
   (D)   The premises within which the adult entertainment business is located
shall provide sufficient sound-absorbing insulation so that noise generated
inside the premises shall not be audible anywhere on any adjacent property or
public right-of way, or within any other building or other separate unit within
the same building.
   (E)   Except for those businesses also regulated by the California
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, an adult entertainment business shall

any particular day.
   (F)   The building entrance to an adult entertainment business shall be
clearly and legibly posted with a notice indicating that persons under 18 years

constructed and posted to the satisfaction of the Community Development
Director or designee. No person under the age of 18 years shall be permitted

from using the restroom(s) for males, except to carry out duties of repair,
maintenance and cleaning of the restroom facilities. The restrooms shall be
free from any adult material. Restrooms shall not contain television monitors
or other motion picture or video projection, recording or reproduction
equipment. The foregoing provisions of this division shall not apply to an

entertainment businesses providing live entertainment depicting specified
anatomical areas or involving specified sexual activities:

then 35 persons, an additional security guard shall be on duty.
      (2)   Security guards for other adult entertainment businesses may be
required if it is determined by the Sheriff's Commander that their presence is
necessary in order to prevent any of the conduct listed in §
118.11(B)(3) from occurring on the premises.
      (3)   Security guard(s) shall be charged with preventing violations of
law and enforcing compliance by patrons of the requirements of these
regulations. Security guards shall be uniformed in such a manner so as to be

No security guard required pursuant to this division shall act as a door
person, ticket seller, ticket taker, admittance person, or sole occupant of the
manager's station while acting as a security guard.
   (K)   The foregoing applicable requirements of this section shall be deemed

§ 118.26 CERTAIN CONDUCT IN BARS PROHIBITED.
   The City Council finds that barroom nudity is a direct cause of increased
demand for police services in and about such establishments, and finds further
that the activities commonly engaged in by both employees and patrons of such
establishments are inimical to the public welfare in that nudity in such
establishments has been demonstrated to increase the occurrence of illegal
activity in and occurring around such establishments. Accordingly, the
following acts or conduct on the premises of any bar are deemed contrary to the
public interest and welfare and the best interest of the community and,
therefore:
   (A)   No bar owner of operator or any employee thereof shall permit any
person on the premises to display or expose his or her genitals, pubic hair,
buttocks, anal region, or any portion of the female breast at or below the
areola thereof.
   (B)   No bar owner or operator or employee thereof shall permit any person
on the premises to perform specified sexual activities as defined in §
118.02.
   (C)   Any bar owner, operator or employee thereof who permits any of the
above while alcoholic beverages are being sold or in the presence of anyone who
has consumed any alcoholic beverages on the premises at any time during the
four hours immediately preceding the act or display referred to above shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (D)   Any person who exposes his or her genitals, pubic hair, buttocks, anal
region, or any portion of the female breast at or below the areola thereof on
the premises while alcoholic beverage are being sold, or on the premises and in
the presence of anyone who has consumed any alcoholic beverages on the premises
at any time during the four hours immediately preceding the display or exposure
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

118.26 shall constitute a nuisance per se, whether or not the violations are
repeated or intentional, subject to abatement at the expense of the person or
persons creating, causing, committing, or maintaining any of these violations.
Where a violation of a valid ordinance is proven, the cost, including court
costs and attorney's fees relating to any proof, shall be recoverable in
addition to any other abatement related costs, both as a personal obligation of
the violator and of the property owner owning the property where the violation

that such persons possess the minimum qualifications necessary to operate such
businesses and to perform the services offered, and to ensure that those
offering these services conduct their work in a lawful and professional manner,
and comply with required building, sanitation, and health standards.
   (C)   There is significant risk of injury to massage clients by improperly
trained and/or educated massage practitioners and this chapter provides
reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss.
   (D)   There is opportunity for acts of prostitution and other unlawful
sexual activity to occur in massage establishments. Courts have long recognized
that massage is a pervasively regulated activity and brothels might attempt to
operate as massage establishments. The establishment of reasonable standards
for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce
the risk of illegal activity without significantly burdening legitimate
businesses.
   (E)   The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter reduce the
burdens on the Police Department and permit the deployment of police personnel
such that more serious crimes may be prevented and more important laws
enforced.
   (F)   The regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter tend to
discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution
and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and rational
relationship to the goals sought to be achieved.

(Ord. 2020-009, passed 7-28-20)
§ 120.62 ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Administrative penalties issued under this chapter may be appealed as
follows:
      (1)   Request for appeal hearing. Any person, corporation, entity, or
responsible party against whom administrative penalties have been assessed
under this chapter may appeal the violation and the issued administrative
citation penalty, administrative penalty, or administrative fines by filing a
written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 30 days of the date stated
on the citation or notice of violation, which shall be accompanied by a non-
refundable filing fee, as established by resolution adopted by the City
Council. The appeal fee is intended to cover the costs, expenses, and city
employees' time incurred by the city in processing, preparing for, and hearing
the appeal.
      (2)   Deposit. Any person, corporation, entity, or responsible party
requesting a hearing under this section must pay a deposit to the city equal to
50% of the full amount of the penalty indicated on the notice of violation upon
submitting the hearing request with the city. Failure to deposit 50% of the
amount of all fines appealed within the 30 day filing period shall result in
the request for an appeal hearing being incomplete and untimely, and therefore
will not be accepted.
      (3)   Failure to timely file an appeal hearing request form with the City
Clerk, along with the filing fee and deposit, shall constitute a waiver of the
right to any appeal hearing, and the penalties stated on the administrative
citation or notice of violation shall be deemed confirmed and final.
      (4)   Hardship waiver. If within the 30-day filing period, the appealing
party establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance or designee,
by means of tax returns, pay stubs or other similar documentary evidence, and
submits a declaration under penalty of perjury that paying the deposit amount
would cause undue financial hardship to the appealing party, the Director of
Finance or designee may grant a waiver or reduction of the deposit amount
required. The Director of Finance's determination is not appealable and shall
be final as to the hardship waiver request.
   (B)   Procedures for appeal hearings for administrative penalties under
Chapter 120.
      (1)   Hearing officer. For any appeal of administrative penalties
assessed or otherwise imposed under this chapter, the appeal shall be heard by
a neutral hearing officer.
         (a)   The City Manager is authorized to develop policies and
procedures relating to the qualification, disqualification and appointment of
hearing officers, hearing officer powers, hearing procedures, scope of the
hearing, and other matters relating to administrative appeal hearings. Any
person designated to serve as a hearing officer is subject to disqualification
for bias, prejudice, a conflict of interest or for any other reason for which a
judge may be disqualified in a court of law.
         (b)   The City Council or City Manager shall appoint independent
hearing officers for administrative appeal hearings or contract with an
organization that provides independent hearing officers.
      (2)   Notice. The person, business, entity, or responsible party
requesting the appeal hearing under this section shall be notified by the City
Clerk of the time and place set for the hearing at least ten business days
prior to the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Conduct of appeal hearing.
         (a)   Testimony at the hearing. At the time set for the appeal
hearing, the hearing officer shall proceed to hear testimony from the
representative of the city, the appellant, and any other competent persons with
respect to the determination of a violation and nuisance or the imposition of
an administrative penalty.
         (b)   Record of oral evidence at hearing. The proceedings at the
hearing shall be reported by a tape recording. Either party may provide a
certified shorthand reporter to maintain a record of the proceedings at the
requesting party's own expense.
         (c)   Continuances. The hearing officer may, upon request by the
person, corporation, or entity against whom a penalty is to be imposed, or upon
request of the city, grant continuances from time to time for extreme or
unusual cause shown, or upon the hearing officer's own motion.
         (d)   Oaths; certification. The hearing officer or certified shorthand
reporter shall administer the oath or affirmation.
         (e)   Evidence rules. Cal. Gov't Code § 11513(a), (b), and (c) shall
apply to all administrative hearings. At the hearing officer's sole discretion,
other relevant evidence may be admissible and hearsay evidence may be used for
the purpose of supplementing and explaining other evidence.
         (f)   Burden of proof. The accuracy of the notice and order containing
the description of the violations or public nuisance and the actions required
to abate such violation or nuisance is deemed a rebuttable presumption and the
burden is on the appellant to provide such facts and information to overcome
such presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.
      (4)   Rights of parties.
         (a)   Each party shall have the following rights among others: to call
and examine witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues of the hearing; to
introduce documentary and physical evidence; to cross-examine opposing
witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues of the hearing; to impeach any
witness regardless of which party first called that witness to testify; to
rebut the evidence against him or her; and to represent himself or herself or
to be represented by anyone of his or her choice.
         (b)   If a party does not proficiently speak or understand the English
language, that party may provide an interpreter, at that party's own cost, to
translate for the party. An interpreter shall not have been a resident of the
premises or have had any personal relationship with or involvement in the
parties or issues of the case prior to the hearing.
      (5)   Official notice. In reaching a decision, the hearing officer may
take official notice, either before or after submission of the case for
decision, of any fact which may be judicially noticed by the courts of this
state, or which may appear in any of the official records of the city or
Stanislaus County or any of their departments.
      (6)   Hearing officer's decision. Within 30 days of the hearing, the
hearing officer shall serve a written order stating the decision made and the
reasons for the decision. The order shall become final on the date of service
of the order, and a copy shall be served on the appellant by first class mail
to the address provided by appellant in the written notice of appeal, and on
the City Clerk by first class mail.
      (7)   Right to judicial review.
         (a)   The failure of the person, corporation, entity, or responsible
party contesting the administrative penalty under this section to appear at the
appeal hearing shall result in a forfeiture of the right to appeal the
administrative penalty and shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative
remedies.
         (b)   Subject to the above provisions of division (B)(7)(a) above, any
person aggrieved by an administrative decision of a hearing officer on an
administrative penalty may obtain review of the administrative decision by
filing an appeal in a court of competent jurisdiction within 20 days after
service of the decision in accordance with the provisions of Cal. Gov't Code §
53069.4(b).

violation of law is corrected by the property owner or other responsible party.
   (B)   The cost of abating a public nuisance or enforcing this chapter shall

§ 121.06 AUTOMATIC ANNUAL INCREASES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE CONSUMER PRICE
INDEX.
   (A)   Annual rent increases starting in 2009. Starting in 2009, on or after
May 1 of each year, the rent may be increased over the allowable rent as of May
1 of the prior year adjusted by 100% of the percentage increase in the CPI last
reported as of January 1 in the current year over the CPI last reported as of
January 1 in the prior year. The percentage amount of said increase shall be
rounded to nearest one-quarter of one percent. However, in 2009, the rent may
not be increased over the rent in effect as of January 1, 2005, by a percentage
that exceeds the percentage increase in the CPI from January 1, 2005 to the
date of the notice of the increase.
   (B)   Notice of annual allowable rent increase.
      (1)   Notice by City Manager. The allowable annual rent increase shall be

§ 121.07 RENT INCREASES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A FAIR RETURN.
   A park owner may petition for a rent increase in order to obtain a fair
return.
   (A)   Presumption of fair base year net operating income. It shall be
presumed that the net operating income received by the landlord in the base
year provided the park owner with a fair return.
   (B)   Fair return. A park owner has the right to obtain a net operating
income equal to the base year net operating income adjusted by 100% of the
percentage increase in the CPI since the base year. The base year CPI shall be
the annual average CPI for 2005 (base period = 1996). The current year CPI
shall be the annual average CPI for the calendar year which is used as the
current year in the application.
   (C)   Base year.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, base year means
the 2005 calendar year.
      (2)   In the event that a determination of the allowable rent is made
pursuant to this section, if a subsequent petition is filed the base year shall
be the year that was considered as the "current year" in the prior petition.
   (D)   Current year. The current year shall be the calendar year that
precedes the year in which the application is filed.
   (E)   Adjustment of base year net operating income. The park owner or
mobilehome owners may present evidence to rebut the presumption of fair return
based upon the base year net operating income as set forth in division (A) of
this section based on at least one of the following findings:
      (1)   Exceptional expenses in the base year. The park owner's operating
expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other
years. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating operating
expenses so the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the
property over a reasonable period of time. The following factors shall be
considered in making such a finding.
         (a)   Extraordinary amounts were expended for necessary maintenance
and repairs.
         (b)   Maintenance and repair was below accepted standards so as to
cause significant deterioration in the quality of services provided.
         (c)   Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding the
application of prudent business practices.
      (2)   Exceptionally low rent in the base year. The gross income during
the base year was disproportionately low due to exceptional circumstances. In
such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating base year gross rental
income consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The following factors
shall be considered in making such a finding:
         (a)   If the gross income during the base year was lower than it might
have been because some residents were charged reduced rent.
         (b)   If the gross income during the base year was significantly lower
than normal because of the destruction of the premises and/or temporary
eviction for construction or repairs.
         (c)   The pattern of rent increases in the years prior to the base
year and whether those increases reflected increases in the CPI.
         (d)   The base year rents were exceptionally low compared to the rents
for spaces in comparable parks in the Modesto area.
         (e)   Other exceptional circumstances.
   (F)   Calculation of net operating income.
      (1)   Net operating income. Net operating income shall be calculated by
subtracting operating expenses from gross rental income.
      (2)   Gross rental income.
         (a)   Gross rental income shall include:
            1.   Gross rents calculated as gross rental income at 100%
occupancy, adjusted for uncollected rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the
extent such are beyond the control of the landlord. Uncollected space rents in
excess of 3% of gross space rent shall be presumed to be unreasonable unless
established otherwise and shall not be included in computing gross income.
            2.   All other income or consideration received or receivable in
connection with the use or occupancy of the rental unit.
         (b)   Gross rental income shall not include:
            1.   Income which constitutes reimbursement for utilities provided
by the park owner.
            2.   Income associated with provision of utility services when the
charges for the utility service are preempted by state and consideration of
said income is preempted by state law. (As of the date of the adoption of this
chapter state law regulates and preempts consideration of income and expenses
associated with the provision of sub-metered gas and electricity. Consideration
of gas and electricity income and expenses for common area services is not
preempted by state law.)
      (3)   Operating expenses.
         (a)   Included in operating expenses. Operating expenses shall include
the following:
            1.   Reasonable costs of operation and maintenance.
            2.   Management expenses. It shall be presumed that management
expenses have increased by the percentage increase in rents or in the CPI,
whichever is greater, between the base year and the current year unless the
level of management services has either increased or decreased between the base
year and the current year.
            3.   Utility costs. Utility costs except utility where the
consideration of the income associated with the provision of the utility
service is regulated by state law and consideration of the costs associated
with the provision of the utility service is preempted by state law.
            4.   Real property taxes. Property taxes are an allowable expense,
subject to the limitation that property taxes attributable to an assessment in
a year other than the base year or current year shall not have been considered
in calculating base year and/or current year operating expenses.
            5.   License and registration fees. License and registration fees
required by law to the extent these expenses are not otherwise paid or
reimbursed by tenants.
            6.   Landlord-performed labor. Landlord-performed labor compensated
at reasonable hourly rates.
               a.   No landlord-performed labor shall be included as an
operating expense unless the landlord submits documentation showing the date,
time and nature of the work performed.
               b.   There shall be a maximum allowed under this provision of 5%
of gross income unless the landlord shows greater services were performed for

than $5,000, whichever is lower.
               b.   The costs, less any insurance proceeds or other applicable
recovery, are averaged on a per unit basis for each rental unit actually
benefitted by the improvement.
               c.   The costs are amortized over a period of not less than 36
months.
               d.   The costs do not include any additional costs incurred for
property damage or deterioration that result from any unreasonable delay in
undertaking or completing any repair or improvement.
               e.   The costs do not include costs incurred to bring the rental
unit into compliance with a provision of the Riverbank Municipal Code or state
law where the original installation of the improvement was not in compliance
with code requirements.
               f.   At the end of the amortization period, the allowable
monthly rent is decreased by any amount it was increased because of the
application of this provision.
               g.   The amortization period shall be in conformance with a
schedule adopted by the City Manager unless it is determined that an alternate
period is justified based on the evidence presented in the hearing.

connection with successful good faith attempts to recover rents owing,
successful good faith unlawful detainer actions not in derogation of applicable
law, and legal expenses necessarily incurred in dealings with respect to the

adverse or other parties, subject to the following requirements:
               a.   Reasonable fees, expenses, and other costs incurred in the
course of successfully pursuing rights under or in relationship to this chapter
and regulations adopted pursuant to the chapter including costs incurred in the
course of pursuing successful fair return petitions. Said expenses shall be
amortized over a five year period, unless the Hearing Officer concludes that a

any amount it was increased because of the application of this provision.
            9.   Interest allowance for expenses that are amortized. An
interest allowance shall be allowed on the cost of amortized expenses; the
allowance shall be the interest rate on the cost of the amortized expense equal
to the "average rate" for 30 year fixed rate on home mortgages plus 1%. The

Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) as of the date of the initial submission

         (b)   Exclusions from operating expenses. Operating expenses shall not
include the following:
            1.   Mortgage principal or interest payments or other debt service

necessary replacements.
         (c)   Adjustments of operating expenses. Base year and/or current
operating expenses may be averaged with other expense levels for other years or
amortized or adjusted by the CPI or may otherwise be adjusted, in order to
establish an expense amount for that item which most reasonably serves the
objectives of obtaining a reasonable comparison of base year and current year
expenses. Grounds for such adjustments include, but are not limited to:
            1.   An expense item for a particular year is not representative;
            2.   The base year expense is not a reasonable projection of
average past expenditures for that item in the years immediately preceding or
following the base year;
            3.   The current year expense is not a reasonable projection of
future expenditures of that item;
            4.   A particular expense exceeds the normal industry or other
comparable standard for the area, the park owner shall bear the burden of
proving the reasonableness of the expense. To the extent that it is found that
the expense is unreasonable it may be adjusted to reflect the normal industry
standard; or
            5.   A base year expense is exceptionally low by industry standards
and relative to current year expenses although the level or type of service has
not changed significantly.
   (G)   Assurance of a fair return. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, nothing shall preclude the hearing officer and the City Council
from granting an increase that is necessary in order to meet constitutional
fair return requirements and to take into account factors which a court directs
the city to consider in a fair return hearing.

§ 123.01 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (A)   It is the intent of this chapter to implement Riverbank's adopted
Vision Statement that, "Riverbank in 2025 will be a pleasant, quiet, friendly
community with a distinct small-town character'; and that "Our city should be
safe and healthy for all our residents". The uncontrolled sale of tobacco
products hinders achievement of this adopted vision. It is the intent of the
city to encourage responsible tobacco and e-cigarette retailing and to
discourage violations of tobacco and e-cigarette related laws, especially those
which prohibit or discourage the sale or distribution of tobacco, e-cigarette,
and nicotine products to minors, but not to expand or reduce the degree to
which the acts regulated by federal or state law are criminally proscribed or
to alter the penalties provided therein.
   (B)   In order to facilitate the achievement of this vision and to protect
the public health, safety and welfare, the City Council finds that a local
licensing system for tobacco and e-cigarette retailers is appropriate. Tobacco
and e-cigarette sales licensing will ensure that retailers comply with tobacco
and e-cigarette control laws and the business standards of the city.
(Ord. 2015-018, passed 11-24-15)

enclosed places of employment made applicable to business establishments by
Labor Code § 6404.5.
(Ord. 2015-018, passed 11-24-15)

retailing by a person for which or for whom a suspension is in effect, or by a
person which or who has had any license revoked pursuant to the Riverbank Code
of Ordinances.

cigarette retailer must supply updated license information within 14 days of
acting as a tobacco or e-cigarette retailer at the new location. If a business
is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that location before acting

checks of each tobacco and e-cigarette retailer will be conducted at least two
times during each 12-month period by the Stanislaus County Public Health
Department. The city shall not enforce any tobacco-related or e-cigarette-

   (A)   Suspension, termination, or revocation of license for violation. In
addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco and e-cigarette
retailer's license may be suspended or revoked, if the Finance Department
determines that the person or his or her agents or employees have violated the
requirements of this chapter or other conditions of the license imposed
pursuant to §
123.04. A person who loses his or her license for one location does not lose it
for all locations, if those locations are in compliance with this chapter, and
may renew licenses for other conforming locations. A person cannot obtain a new

location.
      (1)   Notice required. The licensee shall be served with written notice

a location outside Stanislaus County. The notice shall describe the legal and
factual basis for the decision. A decision imposing a line shall specify the
amount of the fine. A decision to suspend or revoke a license shall specify the
beginning and ending dates of the suspension or the effective date of the
revocation. No decision shall become effective in less than ten days from the
date of service.
      (2)   Duration of suspensions.
         (a)   Upon a finding by the Finance Department of a first license
violation within any 36-month period, the license shall be suspended for 14
days. However, prior to imposing the suspension, the Finance Department shall
by letter (an "advice letter") advise the person that if the person trains all
sales employees at the location of the sale in the laws pertaining to the sale
of tobacco and e-cigarette products to minors and techniques to ensure future
compliance with said laws, the suspension will not go into effect. Within 30
days of the issuance of the advice letter, the person must file with the
Finance Department an affidavit signed by the person and the sales employees
that said training has been completed. If the person fails to timely submit the
affidavit, the Finance Department shall notify the person that the permit is
suspended for 14 days.
         (b)   Upon a finding by the Finance Department of a second license
violation within any 36-month period, the license shall be suspended for 21
days.
         (c)   Upon a finding by the Finance Department of a third license
violation within any 36-month period, the license shall be suspended for 30
days.
         (d)   Upon a finding by the Finance Department of a fourth license
violation within any 36-month period, the license shall be revoked and the
person or persons who had been issued the license shall not be issued a tobacco
and e-cigarette retailer's license pursuant to this chapter for a period of
three years from the date of revocation.
   (B)   Failure to pay renewal fees. A tobacco and e-cigarette retailer's
license which is not timely renewed pursuant to §
123.03(C) is an expired license. The tobacco and e-cigarette retailer shall not
engage in tobacco and e-cigarette retailing at the licensed location until a
new license has been issued for that location.
   (C)   Revocation of license issued in error. A tobacco and e-cigarette
retailer's license shall be revoked if the Finance Department determines that
one or more of the basis for denial of a license under §§
123.03 or
123.04 existed at the time application was made or at any time before the
license was issued. The revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of
a new application for a license.
   (D)   License suspension requires the removal of all tobacco and e-cigarette
products from public view. A tobacco and e-cigarette retailer whose license is
suspended must remove from public view all tobacco and e-cigarette products and
tobacco and e-cigarette advertising for the duration of the suspension. Failure
to remove such items from view will be regarded as a violation of this chapter
equivalent to that of selling to minors.
   (E)   Revocation of license obtained under false pretenses. Tobacco and e-
cigarette retailers whose license is obtained under false pretenses shall have
that license revoked. A licensee whose license is revoked pursuant to this
section may not apply for a new license for a period of one year from the date
the license is revoked.
(Ord. 2015-018, passed 11-24-15)
§ 123.13 ADMINISTRATIVE FINE.
   (A)   Grounds for a fine. If the Finance Department determines that any
unlicensed person, including a person named on a revoked or suspended license,
has engaged in tobacco and e-cigarette retailing in violation of this chapter,
the Finance Department shall fine that person as follows:
      (1)   A fine not exceeding $100 for a first violation in any 36-month
period;
      (2)   A fine not exceeding $200 for a second violation in any 36-month
period; or
      (3)   A fine not exceeding $500 for a third or subsequent violation in
any 36-month period.
      (4)   Each day that such a person engages in tobacco and e-cigarette
retailing shall constitute a separate violation.
   (B)   Imposition of Fine. If no request for a hearing is timely received in
accordance with §
123.14, the Finance Department's determination on the violation and the
imposition of a fine shall be final and payment shall be made within 30 days
after notice of the fine was served in accordance with §
123.12(A)(1). If the fine is not paid within that time, the fine may be
collected, along with interest at the legal rate, in any manner provided by
law. In the event that a judicial action is necessary to compel payment of the
fine and accumulated interest, the person or persons subject to the fine shall
also be liable for the costs of the suit and attorney's fees incurred by the
city in collecting the tine.
(Ord. 2015-018, passed 11-24-15)
§ 123.14 APPEALS BOARD APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal of fine, suspension, or revocation. A decision of the Finance
Department to impose a fine or to revoke or suspend a license may be appealed
to the Appeals Board. The appellant must file a written notice of appeal with
the City Clerk's office within ten days after service of the notice of the
decision. Failure to file an appeal within ten days waives any right to further
challenge the Finance Department's decision. "File" means delivered to the City
Clerk's office in the Riverbank City Hall. The filing of a notice of appeal
automatically stays the Finance Department's decision, until the Appeals Board
has served its final decision on the appeal. The Appeals Board may reverse,
modify or uphold the Finance Department's decision.
   (B)   Notice of hearing, If a notice of appeal is timely filed, the City
Clerk shall provide written notice to the appellant of the date, time, and
place of the hearing in the manner specified in this chapter. A hearing may not
be conducted less than 20 days after notice is given to the appellant.
   (C)   Hearing. The Appeals Board rules governing the conduct of its hearings
shall include the following:
      (1)   The Finance Department shall submit evidence at the hearing
substantiating its decision. Such evidence may include testimony, police or
other reports of the incident, witness statements and other documents. Not less
than ten days prior to the scheduled hearing, the City Clerk must notify the
appellant of the name, address and phone number of any witness to the
violation, and furnish the appellant with a copy of any document it intends to
submit at the hearing. Not less than seven days prior to the hearing, the
appellant may request the Finance Department to produce at the hearing any
witness the department intends to rely upon to substantiate the violation. The
written request must name the witness or witnesses who are requested to attend
the hearing. The Finance Department may not rely on the testimony of any
witness (including such testimony contained in reports or written witness
statements) whose appearance at the hearing is required by this section, if
that witness fails to appear.
      (2)   Not less than ten days prior to the hearing, the appellant must
notify the City Clerk in writing of the name, address and phone number of any
witness the appellant intends to call as a witness at the hearing, provide a
brief description of the proposed testimony, and furnish the City Clerk with a
copy of any document the appellant intends to offer as evidence at the hearing.
The appellant may not call any witness to testify at the hearing who was not
identified as required by this section or offer any document as evidence at the
hearing that was not provided to the Finance Department as required by this
section.
      (3)   At the hearing, the appellant may be represented by an attorney, at
appellant's expense. Both the Appeals Board and the appellant shall have the
right to examine and cross-examine any witness produced at the hearing. The
rules of evidence that normally apply in court shall not apply in a hearing
before the Appeals Board but the Appeals Board shall only consider evidence
which would be relied upon by reasonable people making an important decision,
and shall disregard evidence which by its nature is unreliable or not credible.
      (4)   The entire hearing shall be electronically or stenographically
recorded. The Appeals Board shall base its decision exclusively on the evidence
presented at the hearing and shall issue a written decision, which includes a
statement of the relevant facts which the committee finds to be true and
explains how the facts support its decision. For example, if the Finance
Department finds that the appellant sold cigarettes or e-cigarettes to a minor,
but this was the first violation committed by the appellant within 36 months,
the decision would explain that §
123.12(B)(2)(a) requires a 14-day suspension of the appellant's license to sell
tobacco and e-cigarette products at the licensed location, and on that basis,
the facts support a 14-day suspension of the license for that location. The
record of the hearing shall be preserved for not less than six months after the
decision is served on the appellant.
   (D)   Hearing decision. The chairperson of the Appeals Board shall issue the
written decision required by division (C)(4) of this section. Copies of the
decision shall be served in accordance with §
123.12(A)(1). The hearing decision shall include notice of the appellant's
right to seek review of the decision pursuant to Cal. Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 1094.5 and 1094.6.
   (E)   Finality of the Appeals Board's decision. The decision of the Appeals
Board shall be the final decision for the city.
   (F)   Appeal to Superior Court. Judicial review of the Appeal Board's
decision shall be governed by the Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 and
1094.6.
   (G)   Enforcement of decision. Unless stayed by a court, any final decision
of the Appeals Board is effective immediately and may be implemented and
enforced by the department.
(Ord. 2015-018, passed 11-24-15)
§ 123.15 ENFORCEMENT.
   The remedies provided by this chapter are cumulative and in addition to any

   (E)   In addition to other remedies provided by this chapter or by other
law, any violation of this chapter may be remedied by a civil action brought by
the city attorney or the district attorney, including, for example,

authorized enforcement proceedings, and suits for injunctive relief.

building, or place of business, or from the street to the sidewalk, by persons
exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles;

claims and litigation; and
      (4)   Ensure sidewalk vending activities occur only in locations where
such activities would not restrict sidewalk and pathway access and enjoyment to

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 130.01 DISORDERLY CONDUCT; UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      TUMULTUOUS CONDUCT. Conduct that results in or is likely to result in
serious bodily injury to a person or substantial damage to property.
      UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY. An assembly of five or more persons whose common
object is to commit an unlawful act, or a lawful act by unlawful means. Prior
concert is not necessary to form an unlawful assembly.
   (B)   Prohibitions. No person shall recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally:
      (1)   Engage in fighting or in tumultuous conduct;
      (2)   Make unreasonable noise and continue to do so after being asked to
stop;
      (3)   Disrupt a lawful assembly of persons;
      (4)   Obstruct vehicular or pedestrian traffic; or
      (5)   Participate in unlawful assembly.
(`67 Code, § 7-3-2)
§ 130.02 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

STREET GANGS
§ 130.15 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION.
   (A)   Recognition of rights. The City Council hereby finds and declares that
it is the right of every person to be secure and protected from fear,
intimidation and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and
individuals. It is not the intent of this chapter to interfere with the
exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and
association. The City Council hereby recognizes the constitutional right of
every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any lawful subject whatsoever,
to lawfully associate with others who share similar beliefs, to petition
lawfully constituted authority for a redress of perceived grievances and to
participate in the electoral process.
   (B)   Intent of chapter; deterring activity. The City Council, however,
further finds that a state of crises can readily be created by violent street
gangs whose members threaten, terrorize and commit a multitude of crimes
against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities, both
individually and collectively, can present a clear and present danger to public
order and safety and are not constitutionally protected. It is the intent of
the City Council in enacting this chapter to deter and prevent criminal
activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal activity and
upon the organized nature of street gangs, which together, are the chief source
of terror created by street gangs. The City Council further finds that an
effective means of punishing and deterring the criminal activities of street
gangs is through forfeiture of the profits, proceeds and instrumentalities
acquired, accumulated or used by street gangs.

§ 131.13 REMOVAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Declaration of nuisance. Graffiti is a nuisance. The existence of
graffiti within the city limits is a public and private nuisance, and may be
abated according to the provisions and procedures herein contained.
   (B)   Right of city to require removal (self-removal). It is unlawful for
any person who is the owner or who has primary responsibility for control of
property or who has primary responsibility for the repair or maintenance of
property (“Responsible Party”) to permit property which is defaced with
graffiti to remain so defaced for a period of seven days after notice of same,
unless:
      (1)   Said person shall demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that
they do not have the financial or physical ability to remove the defacing
graffiti; or
      (2)   Unless it can be demonstrated that the responsible party has an
active program for the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the
graffiti as part of that program, in which case it shall be unlawful to permit
such property defaced with graffiti to remain defaced for a period of 15 days
after notice of same.
   (C)   Right of city to remove.
      (1)   Whenever the city becomes aware, or is notified and determines that
graffiti is so located on public or privately owned property viewable from a
public or quasi public place within the city, the city shall be authorized to
use public funds for the removal of same, or for the painting or repairing of
same, but shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or
repair of any more extensive area than that where the graffiti is located,
unless the City Manager, or his designee, determines in writing that a more
extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an
aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or unless the
responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repaint or repairing the more
extensive area.
      (2)   Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a
public entity other than the city, for the purpose of removal of graffiti, the
city shall attempt to secure the consent of the property owner, and a release
of the city from liability for damage to private or public property.
      (3)   If a responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti
within the time herein specified, or if the city shall have requested consent
to remove or paint over the offending graffiti and the responsible party shall
have refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city consistent with
the terms of this section, the city shall commence abatement and cost recovery
proceedings for the removal of the graffiti according to the following
procedure.
         (a)   The City Manager, or his or her designee, (“hearing officer”)
shall give not less than 48 hours notice, served in the same manner as summons
in a civil action in accordance with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 415.10 et seq. If
the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be
served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a
period of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the county in which the property is located pursuant
to Cal. Gov't Code § 6062). The notice shall be given to the responsible party
or parties who are responsible for the maintenance of a parcel of property
containing graffiti (“property”), and, if a different person is the owner of
record of the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained, based on the
last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more

said responsible party and owner shall be entitled to present evidence and
argue that his or her property does not contain graffiti. The determination of
the hearing officer after the due process hearing shall be final and not

the responsible party, owner, or their respective agents, the hearing officer
determines that the property contains graffiti viewable from a public or quasi-

order”) that, unless the graffiti is removed within five days thereafter, the
city shall enter upon the property, cause the removal, painting over (in such
color as shall meet with the approval of the hearing officer) or such other
eradication thereof (“eradication effort”) as the hearing officer determines
appropriate, and shall provide the responsibility party and owner thereafter
with an accounting of the costs of such eradication effort on a “full cost
recovery basis.”
         (b)   Not sooner than the time specified in the order of the hearing
officer, the City Manager, or his designee, shall implement the eradication
order, and shall provide an accounting to the responsible party, and as
appropriate, the owner, of the costs thereof (“eradication accounting”).

before the hearing officer on the eradication accounting (“cost of hearing”),
or if requested, and a cost hearing is conducted after extending due process to
the responsible party and, as appropriate, the owner, after such a cost
hearing, the hearing officer determines that all or a portion of the costs are
appropriately chargeable to the eradication effort, the total amount set forth
in the eradication accounting, or such amount thereof determined as appropriate
by the hearing officer, (assessed eradication charges) shall be due and payable
by the responsible party within 30 days. Any amount of assessed eradication
charges assessed by the hearing officer which are less than the total amount
set forth in the eradication accounting shall be explained by written letter
from the hearing officer to the City Councilmembers.
         (d)   As to such property where the responsible party is the owner, if
all or any portion of the assessed eradication charges remain unpaid after 30

is hereby declared to constitute a lien on the property which was the subject
matter of the eradication effort. The Director of Public Works shall present a

      (1)   The City Manager, or his or her designee (“hearing officer”), shall
give the minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control of the
minor not less than 48 hours notice of a hearing to be held by the hearing
officer for the purpose of showing cause why the city should not recover the
expense of abatement from the minor and the parent or guardian having custody
and control of the minor. Following notice, the hearing shall be held by the
hearing officer at the time, date, and place designated and at such hearing the
minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor may
each be heard and provided with the opportunity to show cause why the city
should not recover the expense of abatement from the minor and the parent or
guardian having custody and control of the minor. Following the hearing, the
hearing officer shall determine whether the city should recover expense of
abatement from the minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control
of the minor.
      (2)   If the hearing officer determines that the city should recover the
expense of abatement from the minor and the parent or guardian having custody
and control of the minor, the city may provide an accounting of the expense of
abatement along with a demand for payment to the minor and the parent or
guardian having custody and control of the minor.

which interest shall accrue at the rate of 1-1/2% per month until paid.
      (4)   In the event the expense of abatement has not been paid within 30
days from the date of issuing an accounting and demand for payment, the amount
unpaid including any penalty and interest therein shall constitute a lien
pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code §§ 38772 and 38773.2 against the property of the
minor and against the property of the parent or guardian having custody and
control of the minor. Prior to recording a notice of lien, the hearing officer

paid by June 30 of each year shall, upon adoption of a resolution by the City
Council, may be collected along with, and in the same manner as, the general
property taxes. The liened property shall be subject to the penalties,
procedures, and sale in case of delinquency as provided in the Civil Code of
California.
      (5)   As an alternative to a lien and pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code §
38773.6, the expense of abatement shall constitute a special assessment against
a parcel of land owned by the minor or by the parent or guardian having custody
and control of the minor. The assessment shall be collected as provided for in
Cal. Gov't Code § 38773.6.
      (6)   In addition to any other remedy provided herein or available at
law, the expense of abatement pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 38772 shall
constitute a personal obligation against the minor and a personal obligation
against the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor.

§ 134.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   Minors often obtain, possess, or consume alcoholic beverages and/or
cannabis at gatherings held at private residences or other private property,
places or premises, including rented commercial premises which are under the
control of a person who knows or should know of the consumption of alcoholic
beverages and/or cannabis by minors, yet persons responsible for the occurrence
of such gatherings often fail to take reasonable steps to prevent the
consumption of alcoholic beverages and/or cannabis by minors at these
gatherings.
   (B)   Consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors who are under the legal
age to consume alcohol in the state is harmful to the minors themselves and
poses an immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare in that it
increases alcohol abuse by minors, physical altercations, violent crimes
including rape and other sexual offenses, accidental injury, neighborhood
vandalism, and excessive noise disturbance, all of which may require
intervention by local law enforcement.
   (C)   Consumption of cannabis by minors who are under the legal age to
consume cannabis in the state is harmful to the minors themselves and poses an
immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare in that it increases
cannabis use by minors, it detrimentally affects the mental and physical health
of minors, and it increases rates of driving under the influence, all of which
may require intervention by local law enforcement.
   (D)   The prohibitions found in this chapter are reasonable and expected to
deter the consumption of alcoholic beverages and/or cannabis by minors by
holding responsible persons who know of, or should know of, the illegal conduct
yet fail to stop or prevent it. In addition, the revenue received by the city
after cost reimbursement, will be directed toward alcohol and cannabis abuse
and prevention education programs in the community.

alcoholic beverages and/or cannabis to minors; and
   (C)   To reduce the costs of providing law enforcement, fire, and other
emergency response services to premises where alcoholic beverages and/or
cannabis are served to or consumed by a minor, by holding the responsible
person, social host, and/or landowners responsible for the costs associated
with providing law enforcement and other emergency response services.

proportionate share of the cost of city parks, water, sewer, storm water,
police, city administration, and transportation capital facilities. It is the
further intent of this chapter that new development pay for its fair share for
the development of these systems through the payment of fees. Furthermore, it
is the intent of this chapter that the System Development Fees imposed on new
development are no greater than necessary to defray the impacts directly
related to proposed new development.
   (B)   It is not the intent of this chapter that Impact Fees be used to
remedy any deficiency in system development existing on the effective date of
this chapter. Further, it is not the intent of this chapter that any monies
collected from any System Development Fee deposited in an System Development
Fee Fund Account ever be commingled with monies from a different Fund Account,
or ever be used for Capital Facilities that are different from that for which
the fee was paid.
   (C)   Particularly, the provisions of this subchapter are adopted for the
following reasons:
      (1)   To provide an adequate and constant method for the financing of the
unfunded portion of needed systems development costs throughout the city,
reasonably related to projected community growth.
      (2)   To promote the orderly and efficient expansion of public water,
wastewater, storm management and transportation systems to adequately meet the
domestic and economic needs of the community and to minimize adverse fiscal and
environmental impacts of new development.
      (3)   To insure the continuation of necessary level of services
including, but not limited to police and general administrative services.
      (4)   To establish equitable methods for allocating system development
costs to the city associated with new development.
      (5)   To regulate the development of land to ensure that new development
bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditures necessary to
develop all necessary infrastructure systems in Riverbank as contemplated by
the General Plan.
      (6)   The General Plan establishes that land development shall not be
permitted unless adequate capital facilities and/or infrastructure exist or are
assured, and that land development shall bear a proportionate share of the cost
of the provision of the new or expanded capital facilities required by such
development.
      (7)   Other revenue sources are not sufficient to fund capital
improvements necessary to accommodate new system development.
      (8)   The General Plan establishes that System Development Fees are one
of the chosen methods of regulating land development in order to ensure that it
bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital facilities necessary to
accommodate the development and to promote and protect the public health,
safety, and welfare.
      (9)   The use of System Development Fees is a means to provide additional
resources for an adequate public infrastructure and services only as they
relate to the needs of new development.
      (10)   The use of System Development Fees is a standardized method for
ensuring that new development pays its fair share of the cost of public
infrastructure systems.
      (11)   System Development Fees are used in the development of the Capital
Improvement Program for financing public facilities, and ensure the adequacy of
public systems to serve development.

city, or portions thereof, at the time and as designated in the study, in lieu
of all, or a portion of, the fee required by this chapter. The owner and/or
developer might be entitled to a credit if the owner and/or developer:
      (1)   Designs and constructs the improvements.
      (2)   Finances said improvements by cash, bond or other means approved by
the Council.
      (3)   A combination of the above. All improvements must be accepted for
maintenance by the City Council in order for credit to be accrued to the
project unless advanced fee credit is authorized by agreement approved by the
City Council.
   (B)   The credit to be provided to the property owner and/or developer shall
be determined by the City Engineer based on prevailing construction costs
consistent with the anticipated costs illustrated in the adopted System
Development Fee Study as may be modified from time to time. The final credit
amount shall be approved by the City Council. The construction of a facility
authorized by this section must consist of a usable facility or segment and be
approved by the city and constructed in accordance with the city's public
improvement design standards.
   (C)   If the amount of credit due is greater than the amount of System
Development Fees otherwise owed for the project, the city, at the City
Council's election, may elect to pay the difference from the appropriate
development impact fee fund, if funds are available, after the improvements
have been accepted by the city as complete. The city shall track and make
payments to the installer of facilities based on a strategy of first in line,
using the date the City Council accepts the improvements as indicator date. The
terms of the reimbursement obligation will be described in an agreement between
the developer and the city.

§ 150.36 RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER EXISTING FEES.
   (A)   Park-in-lieu fees. The park-in-lieu (Quimby) fees are used for the
acquisition of neighborhood parkland while the System Development fee covers
the other capital items necessary for neighborhood park development including
soft and hardscape. Park-in-lieu fees are paid prior to the filing of a final
map in accordance with the Subdivision Ordinance, §
152.037.
   (B)   Sewer connection charges. Sewer connection charges represent the costs
associated with the ability to serve a development. Sewer connection charges
are paid as required by
Chapter 51.
   (C)   Water connection charges. Water connection charges represent the costs
associated with the ability to serve a development. Water connection charges
are paid as required by

§ 150.37 SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT FUND ESTABLISHED.
   All of the systems development charges collected shall be placed in one or
more special funds which are hereby created and established for such purposes
and which shall be known as the Systems Development Funds. Sums collected under
this chapter may only be expended for improvements intended for each System
Development Fund category as established by the City Council. The City Council
may, upon recommendation from the City Manager in consultation with the City
Finance Director, allow cross borrowing of funds only upon making the following
findings for over-riding need and necessity:
   (A)   The cross borrowing of funds will not adversely impact needed
improvements within existing established neighborhoods of the city identified
within the Capital Improvement Program of the city;
   (B)   The cross borrowing of funds will result in a more efficient
infrastructure system with lower operating costs than envisioned by the Capital
Improvement Program;
   (C)   The cross borrowing of funds will have a direct environmental benefit
than otherwise envisioned by the Capital Improvement Program; and
   (D)   The crossing borrowing of funds will not impact needed government and
public safety facilities identified within the Capital Improvement Program.
   (E)   If funds are allowed to be borrowed, then the request shall include a
repayment plan with the mechanisms and timing for the repayment of the funds
borrowed.
   (F)   During the construction of individual facilities identified in the
Capital Improvement Program, the City Manager shall have the authority to make
loans among the System Development Fee funds to assure adequate cash flow for
the construction if said public facility. The City Manager may only do so after
making a determination that the inter-fund loan does not interfere with the
scheduled Capital Improvement Program of the lending fund. Interest on each
loan shall be the same rate then earned on other city funds.

§ 150.38 TRANSPORTATION, PARKS, WATER, SEWER AND STORM SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FEE
CREDITS.
   (A)   A property owner and/or developer or developer who constructs a
qualified public improvement to either the transportation, parks, sanitary
sewer, storm water or the water system may be eligible for a credit to be
applied against the appropriate category of the System Development Fee (SDF). A
qualified public improvement, as referenced, means a capital improvement that
is:
      (1)   Required as a condition of development approval;
      (2)   Is identified in the transportation, park, water, wastewater or
storm system master plans; and
      (3)   Is either: (a) not located within or immediately adjacent to
property that is the subject of development approval, or is (b) located in
whole or in part within or immediately adjacent to property that is subject to
development approval and is required to be constructed by the particular
development project to which the SDF is related.
   (B)   A public improvement that is eligible for SDF credit is one that is
designed and built in accordance with the appropriate utility master plan and/
or identified within the Capital Improvement Program of the city.
Infrastructure lines that are sized to accommodate a developer's individual
service and fire protection needs do not qualify for SDF credits. SDF credits
are possible only for projects identified in the adopted SDF program (Nexus
Analysis).
   (C)   Establishing and recording System Development Fee credits:
      (1)   The property owner and/or developer or developer shall submit a
written request for an evaluation of SDF credits at the same time as they make
the application for Public Improvement Plan Review.
      (2)   The written request shall include the engineer's detailed
construction cost estimate for the qualified infrastructure to be constructed.
      (3)   The method for estimating eligible SDF credits will be determined
by comparing the project engineers cost estimate against current water and
sewer construction costs developed by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Once the Developer has completed construction of the
infrastructure, and before the improvements have been accepted by the city, the
City Engineer may request documentation of final construction costs to verify
actual costs. Actual construction bids shall be provided by the developer and
shall consist of certified payment statements for materials and construction.
If the actual construction costs are less than or equal to the construction
cost estimates that the system development fee credits were based on, the
agreement amount(s) will be revised accordingly. If the final construction
costs exceed the construction estimates agreed to by the City Engineer and/or
as provided in the adopted SDF Program, as modified from time to time by the
City Council, the original agreement amount might be modified to reflect the
extra costs. Any expense in excess of the costs adopted in the SDF Program will
be forfeited by the owner and/or developer unless the City Council agrees to
some other form of reimbursement like an area of benefit.

STREET IMPROVEMENTS
§ 150.55 PURPOSE; PERMITS REQUIRED.
   The purposes of this subchapter are to provide for and safeguard life,
health, property and the public welfare by maintaining and improving the
standards of thoroughfares, for the public safety and for the protection of
public investment in existing streets and highways. Permits are required for
such improvements and shall be issued through the City Building Inspection
Department prior to commencement of construction.
(`67 Code, § 5-6-1) (Ord. 80-4, passed 4-14-80)
§ 150.56 REQUIREMENTS FOR ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   No building permit, when such permit is required by the provisions of this
code, shall be issued for the erection or construction, or the moving onto any
land, of any building or structure, or for the remodeling or converting of any
building or structure when the reasonable value thereof, as determined under
the standards set forth in the most recent edition of the Uniform Building Code
of the International Conference of Building Officials, exceeds $10,000, unless
concrete curbs and gutters, sidewalks, standard driveway approaches and
matching pavement are provided, except as follows:
   (A)   Lots having a frontage of 200 feet or more on a public maintained
street or highway and where only one single-family dwelling is to be
constructed and structures for uses appurtenant thereto.
   (B)   When the Director of Public Works finds that the installation of
concrete curb and gutter and sidewalk, standard driveway approaches and/or
matching pavement is undesirable or unfeasible due to the possibility of
increased traffic hazards, bad drainage, difficulties for on-street parking,
driveway access, or the establishment of grade lines; or any other condition
which the Director of Public Works deems justifiable in delaying such street
improvements until the public maintained thoroughfare is reconstructed, the
owner shall deposit a sum of money, surety bond, or an approved instrument of
credit, in an amount set by the Director of Public Works equal to the estimated
cost of the improvements, which may be retained and used by the city to make
such improvements, after regrading or reconstruction has been done or other
need for postponement has been eliminated or has ceased to exist.
   (C)   In the case of lots having a street or road frontage of less than 200
feet, which are of legal record on the effective date of this subchapter, and
for which no official street plan and profile providing for adequate drainage
or street width has been adopted by the City Council or for other reasons as
determined by the City Engineer for which a delay in the installation of such
improvements would be of advantage to the city, a recordable deferred street
improvement agreement providing for the installation of concrete curb, gutter,
matching pavement and sidewalk (when required by this code) and specifying a
sum to be expended for improvements in an amount set by the City Engineer,
equal to his estimate of the cost of such improvements, plus 15% for each full
year installation of improvements is deferred, may be executed in lieu of
making such improvements. Such agreement shall be in form as approved by the
City Attorney and as accepted on behalf of the city by the City Engineer or his
authorized deputy, and when recorded shall constitute a lien upon the property.
      (1)   The agreement shall be performed and complied with upon demand of
the Director of Public Works after a finding by the City Council that one or
more of the conditions listed below is applicable:
         (a)   A satisfactory drainage system exists, with direct benefit to
such lot, which will accommodate surface storm water to the established
community standard.
         (b)   The public maintained thoroughfare abutting the lot is to be or
has been reconstructed to a satisfactory grade.
         (c)   50% of the frontage of a particular block on the side of the
street on which the lot is located has curb, gutter, sidewalk and matching
pavement installed or the owners of such percentage of frontage have agreed to
install such improvements by agreements executed pursuant to the provisions of
this division. For purposes hereof, block shall be the distance on one side of
a street between two intersecting streets as shown on the recorded subdivision
map, or 1,000 feet, whichever is less. The City Engineer shall establish the
limits of the 1,000 feet, for the purpose of determining that 50% of frontage
is or will be improved. In the case of a cul-de-sac or dead-end street, block
shall mean the distance along one side of the street for not more than 1,000
feet, as determined by the City Engineer.
         (d)   That special circumstances exist which justify requiring
immediate construction of street improvements.
      (2)   The Director of Public Works shall give 30 days notice, in writing,
to the owner of the property to install the required improvements.
      (3)   If the owner of the property refuses or neglects to install the
required improvements within such period of 30 days, the agreement may be
referred to the City Attorney for action for enforcement of the lien thereof,
or the improvements may be installed by the Department of Public Works and the
cost thereof shall become a lien and charge upon the property and collectable
in the same manner as unpaid taxes, together with the costs of collection.
      (4)   Upon the satisfactory completion of the obligation or a
substitution of the agreement by a cash deposit with the city as provided in
the agreement, the city shall record a release and satisfaction exonerating the
agreement and lien thereof.
(`67 Code, § 5-6-2) (Ord. 86-19, passed 8-25-86)
§ 150.57 PLAN AND PROFILE REQUIRED.
   If improvements are required, pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter
or any other provision of this code, plan and profile of proposed street
improvements, prepared by a licensed civil engineer, shall be submitted to the
City Engineer for review and approval prior to the issuance of a building
permit. All improvements shall be completed prior to final approval of the
building or structure by the Building Inspector, unless he shall find that by
reason of special circumstances completion thereof may be postponed, but in
such event, cash in an amount set by the Director of Public Works equal to the
estimated cost of the improvements shall first be deposited with the city.
(`67 Code, § 5-6-3)
§ 150.58 LAND DEDICATION.
   The city shall require dedication of land for street or highway purposes to
achieve conformance with the general plan of the city, prior to issuance of
building permit, or the city may accept in lieu thereof an agreement to make
such dedication in form and substance as approved by the City Attorney.

§ 150.59 APPEAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Any permit applicant, if of the opinion that any decision,
determination, or requirement of the Building Inspector, City Engineer, or
Director of Public Works is an improper application of this subchapter or not
legally justified, may appeal to the City Council.
   (B)   All appeals taken under this section must be taken within 30 days
after the decision, determination, or statement of requirement by filing with
the office of the City Clerk a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds
thereof. The City Clerk shall notify the city official involved of the filing
of such appeal, and the official shall forthwith transmit to the City Clerk all
the papers constituting the file and records upon which the action appealed
from was taken.
   (C)   The City Clerk, upon the filing of such appeal, shall place the matter
upon the agenda for the next regular meeting of the City Council occurring not
earlier than five days after the filing of appeal, and shall notify the
appealing permit applicant by letter of the meeting date and place at which the
appeal will be heard. The decision of the City Council upon the appeal shall be
final.

VACANT BUILDINGS
§ 150.70 FINDINGS; VACANT OR BOARDED BUILDINGS.
   The City Council finds as follows:
      (A)   Vacant and boarded buildings are a major cause and source of blight
in residential and non-residential neighborhoods. This is particularly true
when the owner of the vacant building fails to maintain and manage the building
to ensure that it does not become a liability to the neighborhood. Vacant
buildings can attract transients and criminals. Use of vacant buildings by
transients and criminals, who frequently employ primitive cooking or heating
methods, creates a risk of fire for the vacant building and adjacent
properties. Vacant properties are often used as dumping grounds for junk and
debris and are often overgrown with weeds and grass. Vacant buildings which are
boarded up to prevent entry by transients and other long-term vacancies
discourage economic development and limit appreciation of property values.
   (B)   Based on the likely economic and public health, welfare, and safety
problems caused by vacant buildings, the city needs to monitor the status of
vacant buildings so that they do not become attractive nuisances, are not used
by trespassers, are properly maintained both inside and out, and do not become
a blighting influence in the city. City departments involved in such monitoring
include the Police, Public Works and Building Departments and the Code
Enforcement Division. There is a substantial cost to the city for monitoring
vacant buildings, whether or not those buildings are boarded up. It is the
responsibility of property owners to prevent property they own from becoming a
burden to the neighborhood and community and a threat to the public health,
safety, or welfare, and any costs to the city for monitoring vacant buildings
should be borne by those owners.
(Ord. 2023-004, passed 5-23-23)
§ 150.71 DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions contained in this section shall govern the construction of
this chapter.
   BLIGHT shall mean a condition of decay, deterioration, disrepair, neglect or
inadequate maintenance, including, but not limited to, conditions constituting
a public nuisance pursuant to §
98.03 of this Code, contributing to the diminution of the property values of
surrounding properties, undermining the economic vitality of a neighborhood or
creating health or safety dangers.
   BOARDED BUILDING or BOARDED UP shall mean a building, any of the doors or
windows of which have been covered with plywood or other material.
   VACANT BUILDING or VACANT shall mean a building which is without a legal
resident or occupant or which is not being put to a lawful commercial or
industrial use.
(Ord. 2023-004, passed 5-23-23)
§ 150.72 VACANT OR BOARDED BUILDING MONITORING PROGRAM.
   (A)   Monitoring program. The City Manager or their designee shall be
responsible for administering a vacant or boarded building monitoring program
for identifying and monitoring the maintenance of all vacant or boarded
buildings in the city. Any building, residential or non-residential, which is
boarded up by voluntary action of the owner or as a result of enforcement
activities by the city or is vacant for more than 90 days for any reason, must
register for the program. Every owner of a vacant or boarded building that is
registered in the program shall be subject to a monthly fee in an amount set by
resolution of the City Council not to exceed the reasonable cost of monitoring
the vacant or boarded building, and must submit a rehabilitation plan
containing:
      (1)   A statement outlining the property owner's plan, if applicable, for
repairing the premises for occupants, meeting all applicable codes, offering
the premises for sale, lease, or rent, or actively maintaining and monitoring
the premises; and
      (2)   The expected timeline for completing any actions listed above.
   (B)    Fee waiver. The vacant or boarded building monitoring program fee may
be waived by the City Manager or their designee upon a showing by the owner
that:
      (1)   The owner has obtained a building permit and is progressing
diligently to repair the premises for occupancy.
      (2)   The building meets all applicable codes and is actively being
offered for sale, lease or rent.
      (3)   The City Manager or their designee determines that the building
does not contribute to, and is not likely to contribute to blight, because the
owner is actively maintaining and monitoring the building so that it does not
contribute to blight. Active maintenance and monitoring shall include:
         (a)   Maintenance of landscaping and plant materials in good
condition.
         (b)   Maintenance of the exterior of the building, including but not
limited to paint and finishes, in good condition.
         (c)   Regular removal of all exterior trash, debris, and graffiti.
         (d)   Maintenance of the building in continuing compliance with all
applicable codes and regulations.
         (e)   Prevention of criminal activity on the premises, including, but
not limited to, use and sale of controlled substances, prostitution, and
criminal street gang activity.
   (C)   Procedure. The vacant or boarded building monitoring program fee shall
be billed to the owner of the property and mailed to the owner’s address as set
forth on the last equalized assessment roll of the County Assessor.
      (1)   Any owner billed may apply for a waiver on the grounds set forth in
division (B) of this section by submitting a written statement of the grounds
for the waiver, and the owner's daytime telephone number, to the City Manager
or their designee within 30 days after the billing is mailed to the owner. The
City Manager or their designee shall review the written statement and may
contact the owner to discuss the application for waiver. The City Manager or
their designee shall prepare a written decision which shall be mailed to the
owner.
      (2)   Any owner who disagrees with the decision of the City Manager or
their designee relating to an application for waiver may appeal by submitting a
written appeal hearing request to the City Clerk within 30 days of receipt of
the City Manager or their designee's decision. The hearing shall be set and
conducted pursuant to §§
99.06 and
99.07 of this Code.
   (D)   Collection. If the monthly fee is not paid within 90 working days
after billing, or within 60 days after the decision of the City Manager or
their designee or the outcome of an appeal hearing, the fee may be collected
through a lien pursuant to §
99.16 of this Code.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of California has in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65302,
65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities also contributes to the flood losses.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied
uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned and
within flood prone, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) or flood related erosion areas.
These regulations are designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this subchapter includes regulations
to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.

mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley
floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris
flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.
   APEX. A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow
path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly

excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain
which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured  homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before January 27, 1997.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD, FLOODING, or FLOOD WATER.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY and FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). The official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD ZONE. An area subject to flooding that is delineated as either
a special hazard area or an area of moderate or minimal hazard on an official
Flood Insurance Rate Map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The
identification of flood hazard zones does not imply that areas outside the
flood hazard zones, or uses permitted within flood hazards, will be free from
flooding or flood damage.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable
to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. See FLOODING.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The Building Official of the city a power of which
is to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing,
see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. For purposes of §
151.45, that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of
the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the
fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities
and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring.
In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that
is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HARDSHIP. For the purposes of §
151.45, the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the
requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
   LEVEE. A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement (see BASEMENT definition).
      (1)   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor
that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements including,
but not limited to:
         (a)   The wet flood openings standard in §
151.30(C)(3);
         (b)   The anchoring standards in §
151.30(A);
         (c)   The construction materials and methods standards in §
151.30(B); and
         (d)   The standards for utilities in §
151.31.
      (2)   For residential structures, all sub-grade enclosed areas are
prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see BASEMENT definition).
This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term does not
include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.

land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. Defined in the city substantial damage/improvement procedures.
See §
151.04.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum
(NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, means structures for
which the start of construction commenced on or after January 27, 1997 and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after January 27,
1997.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD or 100-YEAR FLOOD. See BASE FLOOD.
   PROGRAM DEFICIENCY. A defect in a community’s floodplain management
regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation
of those floodplain management regulations.
   PUBLIC SAFETY and NUISANCE. For the purposes of §
151.06, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which
is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any
considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or
use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream,
canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty-truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is
not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may
be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.
   SHEET FLOW AREA. See AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.

or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM
as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the
permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground;
this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or
other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains
of coastal or riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

§ 151.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 25,
2003 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated September 25, 2003, and all subsequent amendments
and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of
applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other
areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to
the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs
are on file at Riverbank City Hall Administration, 6707 Third Street,
Riverbank, California, 95367.

§ 151.08 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the term of this chapter and
other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the
City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.10 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.11 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City Council, any officer or
employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 151.20 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Manager is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce
this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its
provisions.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.21 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to the following.
   (A)   Permit review. Review all development permits to determine:
      (1)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including
determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing
structures;
      (2)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
      (3)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
      (4)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the city; and
      (5)   All letter of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are
approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not
be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved
CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the start of construction definition.
   (B)   Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage
procedures.
      (1)   Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About
Substantially Damaged Buildings.” develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining market value.
      (2)   Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions
and implemented by community staff.
   (C)   Review, use and development of other base flood data.
      (1)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with §
151.07, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §
151.30.
      (2)   Note: a base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two
methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA-265, Managing Floodplain Development in
Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year)
Flood Elevations, dated July 1995.
   (D)   Notification of other agencies.
      (1)   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
         (c)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained.
      (2)   Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations.
         (a)   Within six months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or
assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA
for a letter of map revision (LOMR).
         (b)   All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued on
conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.30 STANDARDS OF CONSTRUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
   (A)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements of
structures, including manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
   (B)   Construction materials and methods. All new construction and
substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
constructed:
      (1)   With flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation;
      (2)   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (3)   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding; and
      (4)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (C)   Elevation and floodproofing.

§ 151.35 FLOODWAYS.
   Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood
waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the
following provisions apply:
   (A)   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the city.
   (B)   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city shall prohibit
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and
other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is
provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (C)   If divisions (A) and (B) are satisfied, all new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with
all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §
151.30.

VARIANCE PROCEDURE
§ 151.45 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only.
Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk
and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
   (B)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (C)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. 2013-002, passed 8-12-13; Am. Ord. 2016-006, passed 9-13-16)
§ 151.46 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of §§
151.20 and
151.30 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (as defined in §
151.05) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (C)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Stanislaus County
Clerk Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the
chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.

§ 151.47 APPEAL BOARD.
   (A)   In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      (5)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
      (1)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see definition of public safety and
nuisance), cause fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
   (C)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of §
151.46 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not
result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
   (D)   Upon consideration of the factors of §
151.45 and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.

any applicable findings required in
Chapter 153, §
153.382 have been made.

City Engineer.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-1)
§ 152.026 STREET DESIGN AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   Street design. Street design shall conform in principle to the streets
shown on the circulation element of the general plan and in width and alignment
to the streets shown on any precise plan adopted by the City Council relating
to streets and shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Dedication of land. The subdivider shall be required to dedicate all
land necessary for street purposes as shown on the general plan or any precise
plan or to conform to the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Improvements. Improvements shall be made to conform to the
requirements of the City Council and to the Standard Specifications.
   (D)   Location. The location of a freeway, expressway, arterial or collector
street shall be as shown on the general plan, a precise plan, or as otherwise
designated by the City Council.
   (E)   The street system. In the proposed subdivision, streets shall relate
functionally to the existing streets in the area adjoining the subdivision.
   (F)   The centerlines. The centerlines of all streets wherever practicable
shall be the continuation of the centerline of existing streets, or shall be
offset at least 100 feet.
   (G)   Street intersection. Intersections shall not be at such an angle that
the intersection is dangerous or awkward.
   (H)   Cul-de-sac or dead-end streets. Dead-end streets where necessary to
give access to, or permit a satisfactory future subdivision of adjoining land,
shall extend to the boundary of the property and the resulting dead-end street
may be approved without a turn-around. In all other districts a cul-de-sac or a
comparable area in another form shall be required, separated to the depth of
one lot from the exterior boundary line or other topographical feature of the
subdivision. No dead-end street shall be more than 500 feet in length.
   (I)   Curve radius. The centerline curve radius of all streets and highways
shall conform to accepted engineering standards of design and shall be subject
to the approval of the Engineer but shall not be less than 50 feet.
   (J)   Rounding of intersection corners. At all street intersections the
block corners shall be rounded at the property line with a curve having a
radius of not less than 20 feet. Where street intersections are not at right
angles, greater curve radius may be required.
   (K)   Grades. No streets or highways shall have a grade of more than 6%, or
less than 0.15%, except when approved by the City Engineer.
   (L)   Street names. All street names shall be approved by the City Council.
Duplication of existing names within the county will not be allowed unless the
streets are obviously in alignment with existing streets and likely to sometime
be a continuation of the other street. At least one street in each subdivision
is encouraged to be named after an historically prominent city resident from a
list as approved by the Planning Commission from time to time.
   (M)   Street name signs. Each subdivider shall pay to the city at the time
of approval of the final map as condition of such approval an amount for each
street name sign required in the subdivision.
   (N)   Street improvements. The following street improvements shall be
required on streets which are along and adjacent to the boundary of a
subdivision:
      (1)   Regardless of any other provisions in this division, a street which
is fronting city-owned property shall be constructed by the developer to its
full width including curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm drainage, and pavement.
Provision shall be made to reimburse the developer for the cost of construction
of any facilities not required by the subdivision.
      (2)   Existing streets with a planned right-of-way width of 60 feet or
less. The street shall be constructed with full street improvements to the
centerline of the existing street. Improvement of the street past the
centerline will only be required when the other driving lane is inadequate to
serve the needs of the proposed subdivision.
      (3)   New streets with a planned right-of-way width of 60 feet or less.
The street shall be constructed to a 40-foot part-width standard to provide for
two driving lanes, one parking lane and curb, gutter and sidewalk adjacent to
the parking lane.
         (a)   Any part-width street so approved shall be at least 40 feet in
width unless the City Council approves a lesser width as set forth in Cal.
Streets & Highways Code § 1805. Such approval for a part-width street of less
than 40 feet shall be based on the following factors:
            1.   The extension of the street is along a property line which
forms the boundary of the subdivision and the necessary width for a 40-foot
part-width street; is not dedicated and the City Council decides not to pursue
dedication; or is not dedicated and the City Council cannot obtain title to the
property within 120 days of approval of the map.
            2.   Adherence to the 40-foot part-width standards would create an
off-set in the center of the subdivision.
            3.   The public interest in having a street without an off-set in
the centerline thereof outweighs the general public policy, set forth above, in
having all part-width streets a minimum of 40 feet in width.
         (b)   In cases in which a part-width street is allowed that is less
than 40 feet in width, on-street parking may be prohibited until such time as a
minimum of 40 feet of the street is improved.
      (4)   New streets with a planned right-of-way width of more than 60 feet.
The street shall be fully constructed from the centerline of the street to the
property being subdivided.
   (O)   Streets and highways. Streets and highways not shown on any other
master street and highway plan or not affected by proceedings initiated by the
Council shall not be of less width than those set forth herein. Increased
widths may be required when streets are to serve commercial property or when
probable traffic conditions warrant such. Approval or determination of the
required width, in the absence of an approved master plan of streets and
highways, shall be made by the City Council.
   (P)   Street widths.
      (1)   Freeways and expressways. Freeways and expressways shall have a
right-of-way as determined by the Governmental Agency.
      (2)   Arterials. Arterials shall have a minimum of right-of-way as
established in the circulation element of the general plan.
      (3)   Collector streets. Collector streets shall have a minimum right-of-
way of 60 feet and a minimum paved width of 40 feet between curb faces.
      (4)   Local streets. Local streets shall have a minimum right-of-way of
50 feet and a minimum paved street width of 36 feet between curb faces.
      (5)   Minor industrial streets. Minor industrial streets shall have a
minimum right-of-way of 60 feet and a minimum paved street width of 50 feet.
      (6)   Cul-de-sac. A cul-de-sac shall have a maximum length of 500 feet
measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the center of the
turnaround. The radius of the turn-around at the property lines shall be 50
feet. Right-of-way and street width of a cul-de-sac shall conform to that of a
local street.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-2)
§ 152.027 ALLEYS.
   (A)   Alleys shall be prohibited in residential subdivisions except when
approved or required by the City Council for any one of the following reasons:
      (1)   To widen an existing part-width alley which has been dedicated and
approved in an adjacent subdivision;
      (2)   To complete the continuity of existing alleys where the property to
be subdivided is located adjacent to existing blocks containing alleys;
      (3)   The special nature of the design or density of a residential
subdivision where dwellings are to be grouped in such a manner as to require
access from other than street frontage;
      (4)   The relationship to existing or proposed adjacent commercial,
industrial, or high density residential development, or adjacent railroad,
canal rights-of-way or other physical barrier;
      (5)   The unusual size, shape or topographical character of the property
to be subdivided.
   (B)   Alleys shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width.
   (C)   Where two alleys intersect, ten-foot corner cut-offs measured along
the property lines from the point of intersection will be required.
   (D)   Alleys shall be so laid out and aligned as to provide reasonable
access for utilities and other services.
   (E)   Alleys shall be improved in accordance with the requirements of the
Standard Specifications.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-3)
§ 152.028 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Acre or large lot subdivisions. Where a parcel is first subdivided
into large lots of such size that they can be further subdivided and conform to
all requirements of this chapter, the design shall be of such form as to
provide for the future opening of arterials and collector streets and for the
ultimate extension and opening of local streets at such intervals as will
permit a subsequent division of any parcel into smaller lots.
   (B)   Block lengths. Block lengths shall not exceed 1,000 feet unless
existing conditions warrant a variance. Long blocks along arterials and
highways may be required to reduce the number of intersections.
   (C)   Blocks. Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit the platting of
two tiers of lots of normal depth, except where blocks are adjacent to
arterials, freeways, or expressways. Such lots shall be created to back up to
such street and front onto a residential or collector street and access rights
to such arterial, freeway, or expressway shall be waived by the subdivider. The
City Council may grant an exception to these provisions to permit through lots
which are to be developed with uses facing both streets when it is determined

that it is impractical to locate such facilities underground.
      (1)   When overhead lines are approved by the City Council they shall
extend along alleys, side lot, rear yard, or privately-owned easements,
whichever is possible, except where such overhead lines cross streets, or must
be located outside of easements for good and sufficient reasons as determined
by the City Council.
      (2)   Overhead service to lots abutting existing overhead lines is
permitted where no extension of overhead lines is required.
   (B)   Street lighting standards, underground cables or conduit and
conductors and all materials and appurtenances necessary shall be installed of
a design and at a location approved by the City Engineer and in accordance with
the Standard Specifications.

sufficient easements or construction, or both, to dispose of such surface and
storm water.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-9)
§ 152.034 SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   Provisions shall be made for adequate sewage disposal by:
   (A)   Connection to sanitary sewer when available by the installation of a
main lateral to the boundary of the subdivision and service laterals to the
property line of each lot. The design and specifications of sewer construction
shall be consistent with the Standard Specifications.
   (B)   Where septic tanks existed prior to November 1, 1981, or existed on
property annexed to the city subsequent to that date, they may remain until
failure, at which time connection to sanitary sewer shall be required, if

adopted or entered into, from time to time, establish conditions under which
such fees may be spread over a period of time.
   (D)   At the time of filing of the final map or parcel map, the subdivider
shall pay to the city such sewer connection fees and front foot assessments as

(`67 Code, § 11-3-12)
§ 152.037 PARK AND RECREATION DEDICATION AND FEES.
   (A)   Purpose. This section is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by
Cal. Gov't Code § 66477. The park and recreational facilities for which
dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this section are in
accordance with the recreational element of the general plan of the city, as
revised on January 9, 1987.
   (B)   Requirements. As a condition of approval of a parcel map or tentative
map, the subdivider shall dedicate and develop land, pay a fee in lieu thereof,
or both, at the option of the city for park or recreational purposes at the
time, and according to the standards and formula contained in this section.
      (1)   The subdivider shall without credit:
         (a)   Provide full public improvements, utility expansions and
connections, including but not limited to sidewalks, curbs, gutters, street
paving, traffic control devices, and street trees to land which is dedicated
pursuant to this section;
         (b)   Provide fencing along the property line of that portion of the
subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land;
         (c)   Provide improved drainage through the site; and
         (d)   Provide other improvements which the city determines to be
essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational purposes.
      (2)   Access. All land offered for dedication to local park or
recreational purposes shall have access to at least one existing or proposed
public street that will provide access to the park or recreational facility by
the time that the facility is completed.
   (C)   General standards. It is hereby found and determined that the public
interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that five acres of
property for each 1,000 persons residing within this city be devoted to local
park and recreational purposes. Two and one-half acres shall be allocated for
community parks and two and one-half acres shall be allocated for neighborhood
parks.
   (D)   Standards and formula for dedication of land.
      (1)   Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the
recreation element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in
whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate
land for a local park sufficient in size and topography to serve the residents
of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined
pursuant to the standards and formula listed below. If the amount of land
needed for the park according to the recreational element exceeds the amount of
land to be dedicated according to the formula, the city shall pay compensation
in an amount as determined pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1260.010 et seq.
and §§ 1263.010 et seq. The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated
shall be as follows:
 
Dwelling Type               Zoning District Standard Density Acres/DU
Single-Family dwelling unit R-1             3.5 persons      1 acre/58 DUs
Duplex/Multiple             R-2/R-3         2.5 persons      1 acre/80 DUs
Mobile home dwelling unit
 
      (2)   Dedication of the land shall be made in accordance with the
procedures contained in §
152.036 hereof.
   (E)   Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication.
      (1)   General formula. If there is no park or recreational facility
designated in the city's recreation element to be located in whole or in part
within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land,
pay a fee equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in division
(D) thereof and in an amount determined, in accordance with the provisions of
this division (F).
      (2)   Fifty parcels or less. If the proposed subdivision contains 50
parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value of the
portion of the local park required to serve the needs of the residents of the
proposed subdivision as prescribed in division (D) hereof and in an amount
determined in accordance with the provisions of division (F) hereof.
      (3)   Use of money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only for
the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to
serving the subdivision by way of the purchase of necessary land and/or the
improving of such land for park and recreational purposes.
(Ord. 89-09, passed 11-27-89)
      (4)   Sale of dedicated land. If, during the ensuing time between
dedication of land for park purposes and commencement of first-stage
development, circumstances arise which indicate that another site would be more
suitable for local park or recreational purposes serving the subdivision and
the neighborhood (such as receipt of a gift of additional park land or a change
in school location), the land may be sold upon the approval of the City Council
upon review of a recommendation from the Community Development Department and
City Manager, with the resultant funds being used for purchase of a more
suitable site.
   (F)   Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication.
      (1)    Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the
amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair-market value of the amount of
land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to division (D)
hereof. The fair market value of land shall be determined by the city with a
written appraisal prepared and signed by a qualified real estate appraiser
acceptable to the city. The appraisal shall be made immediately prior to the
filing of the final parcel map or tentative subdivision map. If more than one
year elapses between the preparation of the appraisal and the filing of the
final parcel map or tentative subdivision map, the city shall cause a new
appraisal to be prepared. All costs associated with obtaining the appraisal and
the reappraisal, if necessary, shall be borne by the subdivider.
(Ord. 90-05, passed 4-23-90)
      (2)   The city declares its intention that fair market value of land for
the purchase of park land identified as a park site shall be presumed to be
that value which would exist on the property were it not contemplated for
development within the next ten years, rather than appraisals calculated on
lost value based on the anticipated or prospective worth of land potentially or
currently available for urban development.
   (G)   Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee. The subdivider shall
both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the
following formula:
      (1)   When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on the
recreational element as the site for a local park, such portion shall be
dedicated for local park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions
of division (E) hereof shall be paid for any additional land that would have
been required to be dedicated pursuant to division (D) hereof.
      (2)   When a major part of the local park or recreational site has
already been acquired by the city and only a small portion of land is needed
from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be
dedicated and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of division (E) hereof
shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise
have been required to be dedicated pursuant to division (D) hereof, such fees
to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreational facility
or for the improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the
area serving the subdivision.
   (H)   Determination of land or fee. Whether the City Council accepts land
dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a
combination of both, such shall be determined by consideration of the
following:
      (1)   Recreational element of the city's general plan.
      (2)   Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision
available for dedication.
      (3)   Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for
dedication.
      (4)   The feasibility of dedication.
      (5)   Compatibility of dedication with the recreation element.
      (6)   Availability of previously acquired park property.
      (7)   Availability of other, equally suitable sites for park property.
   (I)   Credit for private open spaces, partial credit. Where private open
space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision
and such space is to be privately-owned and maintained by the future residents
of the subdivision, partial credit, not to exceed 50%, may be given against the
requirements of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof, if the city
finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following
standards are met:
      (1)   Yards, setbacks, and other open areas required to be maintained by
the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the
computation of such private open space.
      (2)   The private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or
restrictions.
      (3)   The use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor
of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated
without the consent of the city or its successor.
      (4)   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for
park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size,
shape, topography, geology, access, and location.
      (5)   Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the general plan.
      (6)   The open space for which credit is given is a minimum of two acres
and provides some of the local park basic elements listed below:
         (a)   Children's play apparatus area.
         (b)   Landscape park-like and quiet areas.
         (c)   Family picnic area.
         (d)   Game court area.
         (e)   Turf playfield.
   (J)   Procedure. At the time of approval of the tentative parcel map, or
tentative subdivision map, the Planning Commission (or City Council in the case
of a tentative subdivision map) shall determine pursuant to division (D)
hereof, the land to be dedicated and/or fees to be paid by the subdivider. At
the time of the filing of the parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the
land and/or pay the fees as previously determined by the Commission or Council.
Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be
submitted to the city prior to approval of the final parcel map and shall be
recorded contemporaneously with the final map. In the case of land zoned R-2,
R-3, when the ultimate number of dwelling units is unknown, no park-in-lieu fee
shall be collected at the time of filing the final map. When a building permit
is obtained on the parcel so created for which no park-in-lieu fee has been
collected, the fee shall be computed pursuant to division (D) hereof shall be
collected prior to issuance of the building permit.
   (K)   Commencement of development. At the time of approval of the final
parcel map, the City Council shall specify when development of the park or
recreational facilities shall be commenced. Fees collected shall be committed
within five years after payment of such fees.
   (L)   Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential
purposes, provided, however, that if a building permit is requested for
construction of a residential structure or structures, the fees may be required
to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of
such permit. The provisions of this division also shall not apply to commercial
or industrial subdivisions or to condominium projects or stock cooperatives
which consist of the subdivision of air space in an existing apartment building
which is more than five years old, when no new dwelling units are added.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-13) (Am. Ord. 99-06, passed 6-28-99)
§ 152.038 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Positive storm drainage facilities shall be installed as deemed
necessary by the City Engineer to provide for the removal of surface water.
Such drainage facilities shall be of a character and design approved by the
City Engineer and in accordance with the requirements of the Standard
Specifications referred to in
§ 152.025 hereof, in order to insure proper grading and erosion control
including the prevention of sedimentation or damage to off-site property. Dry
wells shall not be permitted as a drainage facility.
   (B)   Whenever the city, by ordinance, has adopted a drainage plan for a
particular drainage area, pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 66483, each subdivider
filing a final map or parcel map for the division of land, any part of which is
located within the boundaries of such a drainage area and the tentative map of
which is filed after the effective date of the addition of this subsection,
shall pay to the city at the time of the filing of the parcel map, as a
condition of approval thereof, such fees as may be required by the ordinance.
The Council may, by resolutions or agreements adopted or entered into from time
to time, establish conditions under which such fees may be spread over a period
of time.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-14)
§ 152.039 STREET TREES.
   Each subdivider of a subdivision, the tentative map of which is approved by
the Commission after the effective date of this section, shall provide, as part
of the improvements of the subdivision, street trees. An amount equal to the
cost of furnishing, locating, planting and fertilizing street trees and
providing and installing supports for street trees in such subdivision shall be
provided. Street trees shall be planted and maintained in accordance with the
provisions of
Chapter 96 of this code and any pertinent policies adopted by the City Council.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-15)
§ 152.040 RAILROAD CROSSINGS.
   Provisions shall be made for any and all railroad crossings necessary to
provide access to or circulation within the proposed subdivision, including the
preparation of all documents necessary for application to the California State
Public Utilities Commission for the establishment and improvement of such
crossing. The cost of such railroad crossing improvement shall be borne by the
subdivider unless, subsequent to adoption of this ordinance, fees for this
purpose have been imposed and adequate funds have been collected to improve the
crossing.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-16)
§ 152.041 MONUMENTS.
   (A)   At the time of making the survey for the final map, the engineer shall

retrace the survey.
   (B)   Permanent monuments as required by the Subdivision Map Act and the
Standard Specifications of the city shall be set except where such monuments
already exist in the proper positions.

map shall include these provisions as approved. The improvement plans shall
include provision of concrete pads with necessary hardware (at the developers
expense) to allow the post office to attach their mailboxes. The location of
such units shall be approved by the local postal service and the Public Works
Department.
(`67 Code, § 11-3-19)

desired. A filing fee as set forth by resolution of the City Council shall be
paid at the time of filing.
   (B)   The secretary of the Planning Commission shall examine the map upon
presentation and shall not accept such map unless the same is in full
compliance with the law and the provisions of this chapter as to form, data,
information, and other matters required to be shown thereon or furnished

   (E)   Prior to the presentation of a formal tentative map, the subdivider is
encouraged to present sketches of his proposal to the Planning Department.
However, such a preliminary sketch is not to be construed as a tentative map.
Where only a portion of a larger area is to be subdivided at this time and the

approve, or disapprove the tentative map within such, 30-day period. If no
action is taken on the tentative map within the above time limits, or any
authorized extension thereof, the tentative map as filed, shall be deemed to be
approved, insofar as it complies with other applicable requirements of this
chapter.
      (3)   The time limit for acting and reporting on tentative maps as
specified in this section may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider
and the City Council.
   (C)   Notices to subdivider. Any report or recommendation on a tentative map
by the staff or Planning Commission shall be served on the subdivider and on
each tenant of the subject property, in the case of a proposed conversion of
residential real property to a condominium project, community apartment
project, or stock cooperative project, at least three days prior to the hearing
on such map by the Planning Commission or City Council. Such required
submission in writing shall be deemed complied with when such reports or
recommendations are placed in the mail bearing proper postage, and directed to
the subdivider at his address shown on the map or at other address as requested
in writing.
   (D)   Findings. A tentative map shall not be approved or conditionally
approved by the City Council unless the City Council finds that the proposed
subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvements, is
consistent with the general plan and applicable specific plans of the city.
      (1)   In connection with their review of a tentative map, the City
Council shall determine whether the discharge of waste from the proposed
subdivision into the existing sewer system would result in violation of
existing requirements prescribed.
      (2)   The City Council shall consider the effect of its actions on the
housing needs of the region in which the local jurisdiction is situated and
balance those needs against the public service needs of the city's residents
and available fiscal and environmental resources.
      (3)   A tentative map shall not be approved or conditionally approved by
the City Council if it makes any of the following findings:
         (a)   The proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and
specific plans.
         (b)   That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is
not consistent with applicable general and specific plans.
         (c)   That the site is not physically suitable for the type of
development.
         (d)   That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed
density of the development.
         (e)   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements
are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and
avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.
         (f)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements
is likely to cause serious public health problems.
         (g)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements
will conflict with easements acquired by the public at large for access
through, or use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this
connection, the City Council may approve a map if it finds that alternate
easements for access or for use will be provided, and that these will be
substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This
division shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (E)   Public access to the Stanislaus River. No approval shall be granted
for a tentative map of any proposed subdivision to be fronted upon the
Stanislaus River which does not provide for a dedication of a public easement
along a portion of the bank of the river bordering or lying within the proposed
subdivision. Reasonable public access from a public highway to the Stanislaus
River shall also be provided. These easements shall comply with the provisions
of Cal. Gov't Code §§ 66478.1 et seq. and may be satisfied by using the
existing United States Corps of Engineers easement.
   (F)   Subdivider to indemnify city. If any controversy exists regarding the
approval of a tentative map, the tentative map shall include a condition that
the subdivider defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the city and its agents,
officers, and employees from any claim, action, or proceeding against the city
or its agents, officers, or employees to attack, set aside, void, or annul an
approval of the City Council concerning the subdivision, provided that the
action is brought within the time period provided for in Cal. Gov't Code §
66499.37.
(`67 Code, § 11-4-5)
§ 152.060 VESTING TENTATIVE MAP.
   Whenever a tentative map for residential development is required under this
chapter, a vesting tentative map may be filed instead. At the time such a map
is filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words, “Vesting
Tentative Map.”
   (A)   In addition to submitting all of the information normally required for
a tentative map, the following information shall also be required with
submittal of a vesting tentative map.
      (1)   Grading plans, including relationship to grades of neighboring
properties.
      (2)   Typical height, size, and location of buildings.

shall be processed in the same manner as a tentative map.
   (C)   A vesting tentative map may be conditioned or denied if any of the
findings listed in §
152.059(D) can be made or if it is determined that:
      (1)   Failure to condition or deny the map would place the residents of
the subdivision or of the immediate community, or both, in a condition
dangerous to their health or safety, or both; and/or
      (2)   The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state
or federal law.
   (D)   When a vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved,
that approval shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in
substantial compliance with Cal. Gov't Code § 66474.2 or if that section is
repealed, with all the ordinances, policies, and standards of the city in
effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally
approved.
   (E)   Approval of a vesting tentative map shall be for the same period as
described in §
152.070 of this chapter. The rights conferred by this section shall expire if a
final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map.
If the final map is approved, the rights conferred by this section shall be
subject to the periods of time set forth below.
(Ord. 89-09, passed 11-27-89)
      (1)   The rights conferred by a vesting tentative map shall last for an
initial period of two years beyond the recording date of the final map. Where
several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a
single vesting tentative map, the two-year initial time period shall begin for
each phase when the final map for the phase is recorded.
(Ord. 93-07, passed 11-22-93)
      (2)   The initial time period shall be automatically extended by any time
used by the city for processing a complete application for a grading permit or
for design or architectural review, if the time used exceeds 30 days from the
date that a complete application is filed.
      (3)   At any time prior to the expiration of the initial time period
provided by this section, the subdivider may apply for a one year extension. If
the Planning Commission denies the extension, the subdivider may appeal that
denial to the City Council within 15 days.
      (4)   If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building
permit during the initial time period, or any approved extension thereof, the
rights conferred by a vesting tentative map shall continue until the expiration
of that permit, or any extension of that permit granted by the city.
   (F)   Any time prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map, the
subdivider may apply for an amendment to the vesting tentative map. A request
for amendment shall include review of the entire map under the ordinance,
policies and standards in effect at the time of the requested amendment.
(Ord. 89-09, passed 11-27-89)

      (2)   Upon written application of the subdivider filed prior to the
expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map, the
Planning Commission may extend the time for filing a final map for a period or
periods not exceeding an additional three years if it determines that
conditions affecting the subdivision have not substantially changed. Such a
request shall automatically extend the map for 60 days or until the application
for extension is approved, conditionally approved, or denied, in any case where
a final map has not been filed within 24 months or such extended period of time
as may be granted by the Planning Commission, approval of a new tentative map
shall be required.
   (B)   Multiple final maps.
      (1)   Multiple final maps of portions of an approved tentative map may be
filed prior to the expiration of the tentative map if: the subdivider, at the
time the tentative map is filed, informs the city of the subdivider's intention
to file multiple final maps on such tentative map, or after filing of the
tentative map, the city and the subdivider concur in the filing of multiple
final maps.
      (2)   If the subdivider is subject to a requirement of $100,000 or more
to construct, improve, or finance the construction or improvement of public
improvements outside the boundaries of the tentative map, the filing of each
multiple map as authorized by Cal. Gov't Code § 66456.1 shall extend the
expiration of the tentative map by 36 months from the date of expiration or the
date of the filing of the final map, whichever is later. There shall not be
more than two such final maps (and automatic extensions) and the extensions
shall not extend the tentative map more than ten years from its approval or
conditional approval.
(`67 Code, § 11-5-1)
§ 152.071 FEES.
   A tracing of the final map shall be filed with the City Clerk. The
subdivider shall provide the city with the County Recorder's fee for recording

by resolution of the City Council.
(`67 Code, § 11-5-2)
§ 152.072 FORM OF FINAL MAP.
   (A)   The final map shall be clearly drawn, printed or reproduced by a
process guaranteeing a permanent record as approved by the County Recorder. The
map shall be so made and shall be in such condition when filed that good
legible prints and negatives can be made therefrom.
   (B)   The final map shall contain a chapter consisting of the name of tract
and subchapter or general description of all the property being subdivided with
reference to maps which have been previously recorded. In no case shall the
chapter be the same, or so nearly the same as to cause confusion as a name of
any existing city, town, tract or subdivision of land of which a map has been
previously recorded.
   (C)   Sufficient data must be shown to determine readily the bearing and
length of every lot line, block line and boundary line. Dimensions of lots
shall be given as total dimensions, corner to corner, and shall be shown in
feet and hundredths of a foot. Lots containing one acre or more shall show
total acreage to nearest hundredth, bearing and lengths of straight lines, and
radii and arc length for all curves as may be necessary to determine the
location of the centers of curves and tangent points shall be shown.
Calculations of all nonrectangular lots shall be provided by the subdivider to
ensure that city codes are met.
   (D)   The final map shall show clearly any stakes, monuments or other

corners of adjoining subdivisions or portion thereof shall be identified by lot
and block numbers, subdivision name and properties shown.
      (1)   Whenever the City Engineer has established the center line of a
street or alley, adjacent to or in the proposed subdivision, the data shall be
shown in the final map indicating all monuments found and making reference to a
field book or map. If the point were reset by ties, the course and detail or
relocation data used shall be stated.
      (2)   The map shall show the location and description of all monuments
and bench marks found or placed in making the survey of the subdivision with
property reference sufficient to relocate.

      (1)   Boundary of subdivision. The boundary of the subdivision shall be
designated by a blue border one-eighth inch in width applied to the reverse
side of the tracings. Such border shall not interfere with the legibility of
figures or other data. If the map includes a “designated remainder” parcel, and
the gross area of the “designated remainder” parcel or similar parcel is five
acres or more, that remainder parcel need not be shown on the map and its
location need not be indicated as a matter of survey, but only by deed
reference to the existing boundaries of the remainder parcel.
      (2)   Right-of-way dimensions. The center lines and side lines of all
streets, the total width of all streets, the widths of each side of the center
line, the widths of any portion of a street being dedicated, and the widths of
existing dedications and the widths of all railroad, irrigation district or
other rights-of-way shall be shown.
      (3)   Easements. The map shall show the side lines of all easements to
which the lots are subject. Such easements must be clearly labeled and
identified and if already of record, the record references given. If any
easement is not definitely located, a statement of such easement must appear on
the chapter sheet. Easements for storm drains, sewers and other purposes shall
be demoted by fine broken lines. The width of the easement and the lengths and
bearings of the lines thereof and sufficient ties thereto to definitely locate
the easement with respect to the subdivision must be shown. If the easement is
being dedicated by the map, it shall be properly referenced in the owner's
certificate of dedication.
      (4)   Acreage. The total acreage of the subdivision to the nearest one-
hundredth of an acre shall be shown on the face of the final map.
      (5)   Lot numbers. Lot numbers shall be consecutive with no omissions or
duplications.
      (6)   Other data. The map shall also show all other data that is or may
be required by law.
      (7)   Disposition of lots. The final map shall particularly define,
delineate and designate all lots intended for sale or reserved for private
purposes, all parcels offered for dedication for any purpose, public or private
with all dimensions, boundaries and courses clearly shown and defined in every
case.
      (8)   Reversion to acreage. Maps filed for the purpose of reverting
subdivided land to acreage shall be conspicuously so designated under the
chapter “The Purpose of This Map is a Reversion to Acreage.”
   (F)   The following additional information shall be required on a separate
document or additional map sheet and shall indicate its relationship to the
final map. The document or map shall contain a statement that the additional
information is for informational purposes, describing conditions as of the date
of filing, and that it is not intended to affect record chapter interest.

profile showing the relation between finished grade and existing ground
elevations.
         (b)   Proposed lengths, size and type of any pipes, culverts or
structures necessary for drainage, erosion control or the public safety with
plans and specifications therefor.
         (c)   Any information required by the conditional approval of the City
Council.
         (d)   Elevations shall be referenced to the U.S.G.S. Datum.
      (2)   An improvement plan shall be acted on within 60 working days of its
submittal, except that at least 15 working days shall be provided for
processing any resubmitted improvement plan and this period shall not include
any days during which the improvement plan has been returned to the applicant
for correction, or has been subject to review by other than the city.
   (H)   At the time of the filing of the final map with the City Engineer, the
subdivider shall also file therewith traverse sheets showing traverse closures
and the computation of all distances, angles, and courses shown on the final
map. The traverse of the boundaries of the tract and of lots and blocks shall
close within a limit of error of one in 10,000.
   (I)   The final map shall be accompanied by a report prepared by a duly
authorized chapter company naming the persons whose consent is necessary to the
preparation and recordation of the map and to the dedication of the streets,
alleys and other public places shown on the map and certifying that as of the
date of the preparation of the report, the persons therein named are all the
persons necessary to give clear chapter to the subdivision. At the time of
recording the approved map, there shall be filed with the County Recorder, a
guarantee executed by a duly authorized chapter company for the benefit and
protection of the city showing that persons (naming them) consenting to the
preparation and recordation of the map and offering for dedication the streets,
alleys and other public places shown thereon are all the persons necessary to
pass clear chapter to the subdivision and to the dedications shown thereon.
   (J)   Prior to the submission of the final map, the subdivider shall comply
with
§§ 152.140 through
152.143.
   (K)   Prior to the recordation of a subdivision map which will result in the
division of any existing building or buildings into separate units or parts,
the subdivider shall secure certification by the Chief Building Official that
any building or buildings to be divided will, after division meet current code
standards for new construction. As used in this section, the phrases “current
code standards” refers to all standards in the current adopted editions of the
Building Code, Electrical Code, Plumbing Code, Mechanical Code and Fire Code
for the city.
(`67 Code, § 11-5-3)
§ 152.073 CERTIFICATES.
   The following certificates, statements or acknowledgements, as well as any
others required by law, shall appear on the final map. Such certificates may be

recorded concurrently with the final map.
   (A)   Statement of parties holding title. A statement signed and
acknowledged by all parties having any record title interest in the land
subdivided, consenting to the preparation and recordation of the map as

   (C)   Engineer's certificate. A statement of the civil engineer or licensed
surveyor responsible for the survey and final map. The statement shall give the
date of the survey, state that the survey and final map were made by him or
under his or her direction and that the survey is true and complete as shown.
The statement shall also state that all the monuments are of the character and
occupy the positions indicated, or that they will be set in those such
positions on or before a specified later date. The statement shall also state
that the monuments are, or will be, sufficient to enable the survey to be
retraced. The signature of such civil engineer or surveyor, unless accompanied
by his seal, must be attested.
   (D)   City Engineer's statement. A statement signed by the City Engineer
shall be provided within 20 days from the time the final map is submitted to
him by the subdivider for approval in accordance with Cal. Gov't Code § 66442.
   (E)   Certificates for execution. A certificate for execution shall be
provided for the City Clerk, the secretary of the Planning Commission, and the
County Recorder, as appropriate.
   (F)   Certificates regarding tax liens. Prior to the filing of the final map

(`67 Code, § 11-5-4)
§ 152.074 ACTION ON FINAL MAP.
   (A)   Approval by Planning Commission. The Community Development Director or
secretary of the Planning Commission, upon receiving the final map from the
subdivider or his agent, shall examine the same to determine whether the map
conforms with the tentative map and with all requirements imposed as a
condition to the acceptance of the tentative map by the City Council. If it is
determined that the final map does not conform, the subdivider shall be advised
of the changes or additions that must be made before the final map can be
certified by the Community Development Director or the secretary of the
Planning Commission. If the subdivider is not satisfied with the determination
made by the Community Development Director or the secretary of the Planning
Commission, he may appeal in writing, within 15 days, to the Planning
Commission. If it is determined that the map is in conformity, the Community
Development Director or secretary of the Planning Commission shall certify
approval thereon.
   (B)   Approval by City Engineer. Upon approval by the Community Development
Director or the secretary of the Planning Commission, the final map and other
data shall be submitted to the City Engineer, who shall examine and determine
that the subdivision as shown is substantially the same as it appeared on the
tentative map, and any approved alterations thereof, that all provisions of the
law and of this chapter applicable at the time of approval of the tentative map
have been complied with, and that he is satisfied that the map is technically
correct. If the City Engineer determines that full conformity therewith has
been made, he shall so certify on the map.
   (C)   Approval by City Council.
      (1)   At its first regular meeting following the transmittal of the final
map to the City Clerk, the Council shall receive the map and shall consider the
map and the offers of dedication. The Council may reject any or all offers of
dedication. In the event that all improvements required or conditions imposed
upon the terms of this chapter or by law are not completed before the filing of
the final map, the Council may enter into an agreement with the subdivider for
posting improvement securities as provided in
§§ 152.075 and
152.076 of this chapter. In such case, when the agreement has been approved by
the City Attorney as to form and by the City Engineer as to sufficiency, and
when the improvement security has been approved by the City Attorney as to form
and by the City Manager as to sufficiency, the Council may consider the final
map.
      (2)   The City Council shall, at the meeting at which it receives the map
or at its next regular meeting after the meeting at which it receives the map,
approve the map if it is determined to be in conformity with the provisions of
law and of this chapter. The Council shall disapprove the map if it is
determined not to be in conformity with the provisions of law and of this
chapter and shall advise the subdivider of its disapproval, and the reason or
reasons therefor.
      (3)   Failure to construct off-site improvements (not within the
boundaries of the subdivision) that are on land in which neither the subdivider
nor the city has sufficient chapter or interest to permit the improvements to
be made cannot be grounds to refuse or postpone approval of a final map. The
provisions of Cal. Gov't Code § 66462.5 shall govern.
   (D)   Action by City Clerk. The City Clerk, upon receipt of the necessary
fees, and after the signatures and seals have been affixed and upon the
approval of the final map by the Council, shall transmit the map to the County
Recorder who shall file the same. No map shall have any force of effect until
the same has been approved by the Council, and no title to any property
described in any offer of dedication shall pass until recordation of the final
map.
(`67 Code, § 11-5-5)
§ 152.075 SUBDIVISION AGREEMENT.
   (A)   If the improvements required as a condition of the final map are not
complete and accepted by the city prior to approval by the Council of the final
map, the subdivider shall execute and file an agreement between himself and the
city, specifying the period within which he shall complete all improvement work
to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, and providing that if he shall fail
to complete such work within such period, the city may complete the same and
recover the full cost and expense thereof from the subdivider. The agreement
shall also provide for inspection of all improvements by the City Engineer and
reimbursement of the city by the subdivider for the cost of such inspection.
   (B)   The fees shall be 3% of the estimated cost of improvements or such
other amount as may be set from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
   (C)   Such agreement may also provide:
      (1)   For the construction of the improvements in units.
      (2)   For extension of time under conditions therein specified.
      (3)   For partial release of the improvement securities upon acceptance
by the City Council of the work as it progresses.
      (4)   For the financing and construction of any or all of such
improvements under an appropriate special assessment act proceeding, the
subdivider shall agree, in writing, to initiate, and so far as may be in his
power, to consummate such proceedings within such time as may be prescribed by
the Council.
      (5)   For payment of a deposit in such amount as is set from time to time
by resolution of the City Council to ensure adequate dust control measures.
(`67 Code, § 11-5-6)
§ 152.076 IMPROVEMENT SECURITY.
   (A)   Improvement security.
      (1)   The subdivider shall also file with the aforesaid agreement, two
improvement securities, each to be in an amount based upon the total estimated
cost of the improvements as determined by the City Engineer. One improvement
security shall secure faithful performance of the agreement and shall be in an
amount equal to 100% of the estimated cost of the improvement. The second
improvement security shall secure the obligations set forth in Cal. Gov't Code
§ 66499.3(b), for payment of the contractor, his subcontractors and to persons
renting equipment or furnishing labor or materials to them for the
improvements, and shall be in an amount equal to 50% of the total estimated
cost of the improvements. Such improvement securities shall be in one of the
following forms:
         (a)   A cash deposit or deposits.
         (b)   A bond or bonds issued by one or more duly authorized corporate
sureties.
         (c)   A savings and loan certificate and/or share.
         (d)   An instrument or instruments of credit from an agency of the
state, federal, or local government when any such agency provides at least 20%
of the financing for the portion of the act or agreement requiring security, or
from one or more financial institutions subject to regulations by the state or
federal government pledging that the funds necessary to meet the performance
are on deposit and guaranteed for payments and agreeing that the funds
designated by the instrument shall become trust funds for the purposes set
forth in the instrument.
         (e)   Any other form of improvement security authorized by the
Subdivision Map Act, including the deposit, with a responsible escrow agent or
trust company approved by the Council, of money or negotiable bonds of the kind
approved for security deposits of public money.
      (2)   The required security shall be in an amount determined by the City
Engineer as sufficient to cover the cost of the improvements, engineering,
inspection, fees and incidental expenses. The required improvements security
shall be approved by the City Engineer as to sufficiency and by the City
Attorney as to form.
   (B)   Forfeiture of improvement security. In the event the subdivider shall
fail to complete all improvement work in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter and the city shall have to complete same, or if the subdivider shall
fail to reimburse the city for the cost of inspection, engineering, fees and
incidental expense, the city shall call on the surety for reimbursement, or
shall appropriate from any cash deposits, savings and loan certificates and
shares, or instruments of credit, funds for reimbursement. In any case, if the
amount of the surety bond, savings and loan certificate and shares, instrument
of credit, or cash deposit shall exceed all cost and expenses incurred by the
city, it shall release the remainder of such bond, savings and loan certificate
or share of cash deposit. If the amount of the surety bond, savings and loan
certificate and share, instrument of credit, or cash deposit shall be less than
the cost and expense incurred by the city, the subdivider shall be liable to
the city for such difference.
   (C)   Release of improvement security. Improvement securities may be
released or reduced, in whole or in part, only in the time and manner
prescribed in Cal. Gov't Code § 66499.7, as it now exists or is hereafter
amended, and only after certification by the City Engineer that the work
covered thereby has been satisfactorily completed and upon approval of the
Council.
   (D)   Guarantee and warranty security. In addition to the improvement
securities specified in division (A) of this section, the subdivider shall file
with the subdivision agreement an amount as specified in the agreement to
guarantee and warrant subdivision improvements for a period of one year
following the completion and acceptance thereof against any defective work or
labor done, or defective materials furnished. The City Engineer is authorized
to release the security upon expiration of the guarantee and warranty period if
it is determined that subdivision improvements so guaranteed and warranted are
satisfactory.

§ 152.093 ACTION ON TENTATIVE PARCEL MAP.
   (A)   Public hearings. Whenever a tentative parcel map is submitted to the
Planning Commission for review, the Planning Commission shall give notice of
the hearing not less than ten days before the date of the hearing in the
following manner:
      (1)   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city,
and
      (2)   By mailing the notice to the owners of all real property within 300
feet of the property which is the subject of the application.
   (B)   Approval by Planning Commission. If the tentative map complies with
all of the requirements of this chapter and the Subdivision Map Act, the
Commission may approve the division, subject to the dedication of necessary
right-of-way for streets and easements, the installation of all improvements
along the frontages of the property so divided, as required by the Commission,
and the installation of all necessary utilities and connections to each lot.
All lot sizes shall conform to the provisions of the Zoning Regulations of the
city.
   (C)   Limitations on approval. A tentative parcel map shall not be approved
or conditionally approved by the Planning Commission if it makes any of the
following findings:
      (1)   The proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and
specific plans.
      (2)   The design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not
consistent with applicable general and specific plans.
      (3)   The site is not physically suitable for the proposed type of
development.
      (4)   The site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of the
development.
      (5)   The design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are
likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably
injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.
      (6)   The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is likely
to cause serious public health problems.
      (7)   The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will
conflict with easements acquired by the public at large for access through, or
use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the
Commission may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for access
or for use, will be provided and that these will be substantially equivalent to
ones previously acquired by the public. This division shall apply only to
easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   Protest. The subdivider, any tenant of the subject property, or any
interested person adversely affected by a decision of the Planning Commission
may file a written protest within ten days after the Planning Commission
action. Upon filing of an appeal, the City Council will hold a public hearing
and render its decision within 30 days of the filing of the appeal.
   (E)   Subdivider to indemnify city. If any controversy exists regarding the
approval of a tentative parcel map, the tentative parcel map shall include a
condition that the subdivider defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the city and
its agents, officers, and employees from any claim, action, or proceeding
against the city or its agents, officers, or employees to attack, set aside,
void, or annul, an approval of the City Council concerning the map, provided
that the action is brought within the time period provided for in Cal. Gov't
Code § 66499.37.
(`67 Code, § 11-6-4)
§ 152.094 FILING; TIME LIMIT.
   (A)   Filing. The subdivider or his agent may file a parcel map with the
City Engineer for his examination, certification, and recordation within 24
months after the approval or conditional approval of the tentative parcel map.
Delivery of a complete and correct map to the City Engineer shall be deemed a
timely filing for purposes of this section.
      (1)   Upon application of the subdivider filed prior to the expiration of
the approved or conditionally approved tentative map, the Commission may extend
the time for filing a parcel map for a period or periods not exceeding an
additional three years if it determines that conditions affecting the parcel
map have not substantially changed. Such request for an extension automatically
extends the expiration date of the map by 60 days or until the application for
the extension is approved, conditionally approved, or denied, whichever comes
first.
      (2)   In any case where a parcel map has not been recorded within 24
months or such extended period of time as may be granted by the Planning
Commission, approval of a new tentative parcel map shall be required. A parcel
map shall be prepared by, or under the direction of, a registered civil
engineer or licensed land surveyor and shall substantially conform to the
tentative parcel map and conditions thereto as approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (B)   Fees. A tracing of the parcel map shall be filed with the City
Engineer. In addition, the subdivider shall deposit with the city the
recorder's fee for recording the parcel map and fees for checking the map, the

§ 152.072 of this chapter for final maps where applicable. The map shall show
the definite location of the parcel or parcels and particularly their relation
to surrounding surveys. The location of any remainder of the original parcel
shall be shown, but need not be shown as a matter of survey, but only by
reference to the existing record boundaries if such remainder has a gross area
of five acres or more. The parcel map may be compiled from record data when
sufficient survey information exists on filed maps to locate and retrace the
exterior boundary lines of the parcel map and when the location of at least one
of these boundary lines can be established from an existing monument line. In
any case, the parcel map may be based upon a field survey made in conformance
with the Land Surveyor's Act.
   (D)   Consent by owner. The parcel map shall contain a certificate which
shall be signed and acknowledged by all parties having any record title
interest in the real property being subdivided, consenting to the preparation
and recording of the parcel map. Such signatures shall be in accordance with
the provisions of
§ 152.073 of this chapter pertaining to final maps.
   (E)   Dedications. If dedication of streets, alleys, walkways, easements,
public utility easements or other public ways or access rights are required by
the Commission as conditions of approval of a parcel map, such dedications
shall either be shown on and offered by a certificate on the final parcel map,
or made by separate instrument as determined by the City Engineer. Such
certificate or instrument shall be signed by those parties having any record
title interest in the real property being subdivided in accordance with the
provisions of
§ 152.073 of this chapter pertaining to final maps.
   (F)   Engineer's statement. A statement executed by the engineer or surveyor
shall be affixed to the map pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 66449.
   (G)   Certification by City Engineer. Upon receipt of the final map,
together with the recording fees, and any required improvement security, the
City Engineer shall examine the same to determine whether the map is
technically correct and substantially conforms with tentative parcel map and
with all changes and requirements imposed as conditions of approval by the
Commission. The City Engineer shall also refer the parcel map to the secretary
of the Planning Commission for examination and determination if all the lots
and parcels created by the map conform with the requirements and the zoning
regulations of the city. Within 20 days after receiving the parcel map, the
City Engineer shall determine whether the parcel map fully conforms with all of
the requirements set forth herein and he shall comply with Cal. Gov't Code §
66450.
   (H)   Acceptance of dedications. Offers of dedication as set forth in
division (E) of this section shall be reviewed by the City Engineer for
compliance with the conditions of approval imposed by the Commission. If all
offers of dedication are in accordance with the requirements of the Commission,
the City Engineer shall recommend the acceptance of such dedications by the
authorized officials of the city.
   (I)   Security. If the Commission approves the tentative parcel map, it may
grant the subdivider a period of time after the recording of the parcel map in
which to complete the installation of the public improvements required as a
condition of the map by the Planning Commission. If such a time period is
granted, the Planning Commission shall require improvement security to be
posted in one of the forms set forth in
§ 152.076(A).
   (J)   Division of existing buildings. Prior to the recordation of a parcel
map which will result in the division of any existing building or buildings
into separate units or parts, the applicant shall secure certification by the
Chief Building Official that any building or buildings to be divided will,
after division, meet current code standards for new construction. As used in
this section, the phrase “current code standards” refers to all standards in
the current adopted editions of the Building Code, Electrical Code, Plumbing
Code, Mechanical Code, and Fire Code of the city.
   (K)   Recordation of parcel map. Upon certification by the City Engineer,
the parcel map shall be transmitted to the City Clerk, who shall cause the map
to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
(`67 Code, § 11-6-5)
§ 152.095 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building,

§ 152.097 VESTING TENTATIVE PARCEL MAPS.
   Whenever a tentative parcel map is required under this chapter, a vesting
tentative parcel map may be filed instead. At the time such a map is filed, it
shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative
Parcel Map.” The map shall be subject to the same procedures, time periods,
requirements and restrictions as described in
§ 152.060 for tentative subdivision map, except that the time periods specified
in
§ 152.060(E) shall be determined from the recordation of the parcel map instead
of the final map.

§ 152.098 WAIVER OF PARCEL MAP REQUIREMENTS.
   The requirement for a final parcel map may be waived by the Planning

   In the event an existing subdivision is resubdivided such that the street
alignment, lot design or drainage shall be changed, then the area constitutes a

   Subdivided lands may be merged and re-subdivided without reverting to
acreage by complying with all applicable requirements for the subdivision of
land as provided for in this title. The filing of the final map or final parcel

EXCEPTION
§ 152.125 AUTHORITY TO VARY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The City Council may vary the regulations relating to the subdivision
of land by granting an exception, provided it is shown by the subdivider that:
      (1)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applicable to the property such as topography, fixed rights-of-way, unique
location of easements, and the like.
      (2)   Because of the unique nature of a particular subdivision concept,
design innovations are proposed which meet the functional standards of Zoning
and Subdivision Regulations without strict adherence to the requirements of
this chapter.
      (3)   In the case of a parcel map, the applicant is being denied the
preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other
property in the same vicinity or zone in which the property is located.
      (4)   The granting of the exception will not be injurious to other
property or improvements in the vicinity or zone in which the property is
located and will not nullify the intent and purpose of the general plan or
these regulations.
   (B)   Where it is determined by the City Council that the design of a
proposed subdivision is in compliance with a development plan which has been
adopted by the City Council in conjunction with a Planned Development Zone, the
City Council may approve such subdivision map without formally granting
exceptions for design factors which are not in strict compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.

as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards
or requirements to be excepted.

§ 152.141 PRELIMINARY SOIL REPORT.
   Prior to the submission of the final subdivision map, the subdivider shall
file with the Building Inspector and the City Engineer, a preliminary soil
report, prepared by a civil engineer or soil engineer who is registered by the
state, based upon adequate test borings or excavations of every subdivision as
defined in Cal. Gov't Code § 66424. The preliminary soil report may be waived
if the Building Inspector and City Engineer shall determine that, due to their
knowledge as to the soil qualities of the subdivision, no preliminary analysis
is necessary.
(`67 Code, § 11-9-2)
§ 152.142 SOIL INVESTIGATION.
   If the preliminary soil report indicates the presence of critically
expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, would lead to
structural defects, a soil investigation of each lot in the subdivision shall
be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by the state. The soil
investigation shall recommend corrective action which is likely to prevent
structural damage to each dwelling proposed to be constructed on the expansive
soil. The report shall be filed with the Building Inspector and City Engineer.
(`67 Code, § 11-9-3)
§ 152.143 APPROVAL OF SOIL INVESTIGATION.
   The Building Inspector and City Engineer shall submit reports to the City
Council describing whether or not the recommended corrective action is likely
to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be constructed on each lot in
the subdivision. The City Council may approve the subdivision or portion
thereof where such soil problems exist if it determines that the recommended
action is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure. The building
permit shall be conditioned upon this incorporation of the approved recommended
corrective action in the construction of each structure.

with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this chapter. If the
Director determines the property or the division thereof complies with the
provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this chapter, a certificate of
compliance shall be issued. If the Director determines the property or the
division thereof does not comply with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act
and this chapter, the Director shall forward the request to the Commission. The
Commission, following a public hearing, shall then direct the Director to issue
either a certificate of compliance or a conditional certificate of compliance.
A certificate of compliance may impose conditions as permitted by the
Subdivision Map Act. Any parcel created prior to April 27, 1966, shall be
conclusively presumed to have been lawfully created if the parcel resulted from
a division of land in which fewer than five parcels were created.

on applicants for a permit, a request for legislative change, or an appeal
under this chapter, to cover the costs of all aspects of administration of the
city planning agency and all other city departments relating to the processing
and decision on the application. Application fees are intended to cover
application processing, review, and evaluation; meetings, consultations, and
research; hearings and appeals; preparation and revisions to plans and policies
that the city is required to adopt to make necessary findings and
determinations; environmental review and technical studies; consultant and
legal services, city staff and administrative overhead. The amount or method of
calculation of the application fee (including deposits and hourly rates), and
each component of the fee, shall be established by resolution of the City
Council.
   (B)   Application and processing fee options. Application and processing
fees shall be in the amount and subject to terms as follows:
      (1)   Application fee based on estimate of processing costs. An
application fee based on an estimate of the overall processing costs related to
the application shall be paid upon submission of the application. If the actual
cost of processing the application exceeds the initial deposit or fee paid, the
Community Development Director may mail notice to the applicant, using the
applicant's address stated in the application, specifying the amount of the
additional fee and stating that the additional fee is immediately due and
payable.
      (2)   Fee based on actual processing costs. An application fee based on
actual processing costs shall be calculated using the applicable hourly rate
and shall be billed and paid in accordance with administrative rules and
regulations established by the planning director. Monthly invoices shall be
mailed to the applicant, using the applicant's address stated in the
application, specifying the amount of fees incurred.
      (3)   Deposit based on actual processing costs. The City Manager or
Community Development Director may require a deposit or cost recovery
agreement, based on the city's estimate of the overall processing costs related
to the application. If a deposit is required, the application shall not be
deemed complete until the applicant provides the deposit, in cash or check, to
the city. A minimum balance of at least 25% of the initial deposit amount must
be maintained by the applicant at all times during the city's review and
processing of the development application, unless waived by the Planning
Director or City Manager because they determine that less than 25% of the
initial deposit is required to finish the city's review and processing of the
development application. The city shall provide monthly notices of the deposit
balance to applicants. Notices shall reflect the actual costs incurred by the
city in processing the application.
      (4)   Selection of application fee or deposit. The Planning Director
shall determine whether the fee for an application shall be fee-based or
deposit-based taking into account the project type and complexity.
      (5)   Suspension of application processing. The planning director shall
suspend the processing of an application if the applicant does not pay any
portion of an application fee or the minimum deposit within 30 days of such
request by the city. The application shall be reactivated following full
payment of fees or the minimum deposit, unless the application has been denied
or withdrawn.
      (6)   Fees paid in full prior to public hearing. All application fees and
actual processing costs shall be paid in full prior to (i) the first public or
administrative hearing to review the application or (ii) the city's final
determination regarding the application, whichever occurs first based on the
type of application and required approvals. No exceptions shall be made to any
developer or applicant.
   (C)   Appeal and modification. Notwithstanding §
153.251 of this chapter, the amount or propriety of an application fee or
deposit may be appealed to the City Council. The City Council, by resolution,
may waive or modify an application fee.

prior to a decision on the application, the applicant may be entitled to a
refund, without interest, of those portions of the application fee or deposit
paid to the city for performance of services or payment of costs associated
with the application that have not yet been performed or incurred. The
applicant must submit an application for the refund within 30 days of
withdrawal of the application. Failure to submit a timely application for a
refund shall be an absolute waiver of any right to the refund.

TINY HOUSE VILLAGES
§ 153.170 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to:
      (1)   Provide development regulations for tiny house villages, which
support a diversity of housing choices to meet a wide variety of housing needs;
      (2)   Encourage creation of more usable space for residents of tiny house
village developments through flexibility in lot standards;
      (3)   Ensure that the overall size, including bulk and mass of tiny house
village structures remains smaller and incurs less visual impact than standard
size single-family dwellings, particularly given allowed intensity of tiny
house village developments;
      (4)   Provide a centrally located and functional common open space area
that fosters a sense of community and a sense of openness in tiny house village
developments;
      (5)   Provide private areas around the individual tiny house dwellings to
enable diversity in landscape design and foster a sense of ownership; and
      (6)   Ensure minimal visual impact from vehicular use and storage areas
for residents of the tiny house village development as well as adjacent
properties, and to maintain a detached single-family character along public
streets.

areas), as well as the landscaping, lighting, and other development features,
is compatible with and compliments the existing surrounding environment and
ultimate character of the area under the general plan.
      (4)   The proposed architecture, including the character, scale, and
quality of the design, relationship with the site and other buildings, building
materials, colors, screening of exterior appurtenances, exterior lighting, and
similar elements, establishes a clear design concept and is compatible with the
character of the buildings on adjoining and nearby properties.
   (E)   Conditions. The Planning Commission may designate such conditions in

§ 153.218 VARIANCE.
   (A)   Purpose. Each zoning district has specific development standards and a
variance is a special request for the city to waive or alter one or more of

provided in this section except for uses not permitted by zoning district

provisions of §
153.215.

findings to approve a variance application:
      (1)   Because of special circumstances applicable to the property
including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict
application of the zoning ordinance deprives the subject property of the
privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical zone
classifications.
      (2)   The granting of the application is necessary for the preservation
and enjoyment of substantial property rights of the petitioner and will not
constitute a grant of special privileges.
      (3)   The granting of such application will not, under the circumstances
of the particular case, materially adversely affect the health or safety of
persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the property of the
applicant and will not, under the circumstances of the particular case be
materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or
improvements in said neighborhood.
   (E)   Conditions. The Planning Commission may impose such conditions in
connection with a variance as it deems necessary to secure the purposes of this
chapter and may require a bond guarantee or other assurances that such
conditions are being or will be complied with.
   (F)   Appeal. Appeal of the Planning Commission's action on the request for
a variance shall be made in accordance with the procedures specified in §
153.219.
   (G)   Effect.
      (1)   The variance shall not become effective for ten days after being
granted and in the event an appeal is filed, shall not become effective until a
decision is made by the Council on such appeal.
      (2)   No application for a variance which has been denied shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said order of denial
became final, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of
conditions found to be valid by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Any variance granted shall be null and void 12 months from the date
of final approval thereof unless prior to such expiration date, the property is
being used as stated in the variance, or unless a valid building permit is in
effect for the construction of buildings or appurtenances to such variance. The
Planning Commission may defer expiration of the variance for a period not
exceeding one year upon receiving an application, in writing, by the owner of
the property prior to expiration provided the conditions for granting the
variance have not changed.
      (4)   The Planning Commission may revoke or modify the approval of a
variance as indicated in §
153.247.

SIGNS
§ 153.280 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of this sign ordinance regulation to preserve and enhance
the aesthetic, traffic safety and environmental values of our communities and
growing business/industrial districts, while at the same time providing for
channels of communication to the public. It also is the city's intent to
regulate on the basis of characteristic and proportion of signage. The city
finds as to commercial signage that it is in the interest of both aesthetics
and traffic safety that sign information be kept to a minimum. The use of
subordinate information in commercial signage which presents as a traffic
hazard will not be allowed. Non-commercial signage, which rights are
constitutionally broader, is permitted unless expressly prohibited within this
chapter.

SPECIFIC PLAN DISTRICT SP
§ 153.305 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the specific plan district (SP) is to provide a vehicle for
implementing the city's general plan on an area specific basis. A specific plan
prepared in accordance with the standards set forth herein is intended to serve
as a regulatory document, consistent with the general plan. In the event of an
inconsistency, or conflict between an adopted specific plan and comparable
regulations of the municipal code, the specific plan will prevail.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
Statutory reference:
   Specific plans, see Cal. Gov't Code §§ 65450 et seq.
§ 153.306 AUTHORITY.
   Specific plans are authorized by Cal. Gov't Code §§ 65450 et seq. which
specifies minimum contents and provides for fees and an additional
environmental review procedure.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.307 APPLICABILITY.
   Chapter III Section A(9) of the land use element of the general plan
encourages the preparation of specific plans and identifies certain areas of
the city for which specific plans are required prior to development.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.308 DELINEATION OF SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS.
   It is not necessary for specific plan areas to be delineated on the general
plan land use map. On the zoning map a specific plan district will be
delineated in a manner similar to that of any other zoning district except that
each specific plan zoned area shall also bear a number which distinguishes it
from other specific plan areas. In most cases, an adopted specific plan will
create zoning categories unique to that plan; those zoning categories will be
described within the plan itself rather than on the zoning map or in the
municipal code.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.309 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   A specific plan shall be adopted by resolution, following public
hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council. Application for other
entitlements may be made simultaneously with the specific plan application. In
some circumstances, simultaneous applications may be necessary.
   (B)   Concurrent with the adoption of a specific plan, the plan area must be
zoned SP and assigned a number as required in
§ 153.308 above. The zoning and specific plan applications may be processed
simultaneously. In some areas it may be necessary or appropriate to link
adoption of the specific plan with adoption of other entitlements or programs
such as subdivision or parcel maps, area facilities plans, design guidelines,
monitoring programs, PD permits, financing mechanisms, etc. The specific plan
shall define the relationship of the plan to other approvals.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.310 APPLICATION.
   The application for a specific plan shall be in accordance with public
hearing processes prescribed in Cal. Gov't Code § 65453 and shall include text
and diagram(s) as required by the Planning Commission to properly evaluate the
ability of the proposed specific plan to carry out the city's general plan. Due
to the significant role an adopted specific plan plays in the implementation of
the general plan, application preparers shall seek guidance from the Planning
Department and, if necessary, the Planning Commission, prior to submitting an
application for a specific plan. Such guidance regarding relevant general plan
goals, policies, land use and implementation programs shall be provided through
pre-application conferences, written material, study sessions or other
appropriate means. Application and implementation fees for specific plans shall
be as set by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.311 SPECIFIC PLAN CONTENTS.
   (A)   State law requirements. State law specifies at Cal. Gov't Code § 65451
the matters which must be included in a specific plan:
      “(A)   A specific plan shall include a text and diagram or diagrams which
specify all of the following in detail:
         (1)   The distribution, location and extent of the uses of land,
including open space, within the area covered by the plan.
         (2)   The proposed distribution, location and extent and intensity of
major components of public and private transportation, sewage, water, drainage,
solid waste disposal, energy and other essential facilities proposed to be
located within the area covered by the plan and needed to support the land uses
described in the plan.
         (3)   Standards and criteria by which development will proceed and
standards for the conservation, development and utilization of natural
resources where applicable.
         (4)   A program of implementation measures including regulations,
programs, public works projects and financing measures necessary to carry out
divisions (1), (2) and (3) above.
      (B)   The specific plan shall include a statement of the specific plan to
the general plan.”
   (B)   City requirements.
      (1)   The city's requirements include the state requirements listed above
but in sufficient depth, scope and detail to provide not only policies for the
development of the area but also specific standards for regulating that
development.
      (2)   A specific plan must include the following:
         (a)   The proposed land uses for all areas covered by the plan.
         (b)   The location of and types of streets.
         (c)   Public facilities and infrastructure required to serve
developments within the specific plan area.
         (d)   Proposed conservation open space and/or recreation areas, if
any.
         (e)   Financial and economic analysis.
      (3)   To meet the goal of tailoring general plan implementation to a
specific area, no one format is prescribed, but the text and diagrams prepared
must be organized in a manner that clearly states the goals of the specific
plan and clearly sets forth regulations in a format readily usable by both
professional and lay persons who may have a role in implementing the specific
plan. The Planning Department shall provide a checklist and examples of
specific plan contents to assist applicants.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.312 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.
   It is anticipated, under the California Environmental Quality Act (Cal. Pub.
Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.) and guidelines, that most specific plans will
require preparation of an environmental impact report. Once certified, the EIR
for a specific plan may be relied upon for further entitlements to the extent
allowed by the law, sought subsequent to adoption of the specific plan.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.313 AMENDMENT.
   A specific plan may be amended as necessary under the same procedure as
adoption of a specific plan.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)
§ 153.314 EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION.
   Since specific plan applications are flexible, expiration will be determined
on a case-by-case basis. Like other city regulations, most specific plan
approvals will not expire unless replaced by a subsequently adopted specific
plan or rendered obsolete by adoption of a conflicting general plan
designation. In some cases, however, limiting the duration an approval may be
appropriate when the specific plan is linked to another entitlement which
expires (that is, much as a tentative subdivision map). The resolution adopting
a specific plan shall specify the duration of the specific plan and any means
of extension, which may include an evaluation of an applicant's due diligence
in satisfying specific plan provisions.
(Ord. 95-06, passed 4-24-95)

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS
§ 153.335 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish general guidelines for
the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this
subchapter are to:
      (1)   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
      (2)   Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and
publicly-owned lands;
      (3)   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
      (4)   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
      (5)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
      (6)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through
careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
      (7)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently;
      (8)   Consider the public health and safety of communication towers;
      (9)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures; and
      (10)   Protect the aesthetic entrance and corridors of the community.
   (B)   In furtherance of these goals, the city shall give due consideration
to the general plan and specific plans of the city, zoning map, existing land
uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location
of towers and antennas.

a building permit or special use permit has been properly issued prior to the
effective date of this subchapter, including permitted towers or antennas that
have not yet been constructed, so long as such approval is current and not
expired.
   TOWER. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the
purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone, radio and similar
communication purposes, including self-supporting lattice towers, guyed towers,
or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers,
microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative
tower structures, and the like. This term includes the structure and any
support thereto.
(Ord. 99-07, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.337 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   New towers and antennas. All new towers or antennas in the city and
its sphere of influence shall be subject to these regulations, except as
provided in divisions (B) through (D) of this section.
   (B)   Amateur radio station operators, receive-only antennas. This

outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM array. Additional tower units
may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by conditional use permit.
(Ord. 99-07, passed 6-28-99)
§ 153.338 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on the lot.
   (B)   Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but
not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within the lot.
   (C)   Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Community Development Director an inventory of its
existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are
either within the jurisdiction of the city and its sphere of influence or
within one mile of the border thereof; including specific information about the
location, height, and design of each tower. The Community Development Director
may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative
approvals or conditional use permits under this subchapter or other
organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city
and its sphere-of-influence, provided, however that the Community Development
Director is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or
warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
   (D)   Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements
and are subject to review and approval by the city:
      (1)   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject
to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness. The finish shall be subject to the Community
Development Director's approval where administrative permits are considered and
by the Planning Commission where conditional use permits are required.
      (2)   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
      (3)   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure, so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
   (E)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
   (F)   State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the
state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.
If any standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this subchapter shall bring the towers and antennas into
compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six months of the
effective date of the standards and regulations, unless a different compliance
schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance with revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner's expense.
   (G)   Building Codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes
and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
city concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided
to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring the tower into

factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the
Planning Commission may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or
more of these criteria if the Planning Commission concludes that the goals of
this subchapter are better served thereby:
         (a)   Height of the proposed tower;
         (b)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
         (c)   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
         (d)   Surrounding topography;
         (e)   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
         (f)   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
         (g)   Proposed ingress and egress; and
         (h)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in §
153.341(B)(3).
      (3)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Commission that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the Planning Commission
related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
         (a)   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         (b)   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         (c)   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
         (d)   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antennas on the existing towers or structures, or the
antennas on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
         (e)   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
         (f)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
         (g)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/ receivers attached to a
wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
      (4)   Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that
the Planning Commission may reduce the standard setback requirements if the
goals of this subchapter would be better served thereby:

height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
         (b)   Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
      (5)   Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to
all towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is required;
provided, however, that the Planning Commission may reduce the standard
separation requirements if the goals of this subchapter would be better served
thereby:
         (a)   Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
            1.   Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in

      (5)   Premises shall be equipped for meal service and maintained in good
faith. Premises must possess and maintain appliances for the cooking of a
variety of foods such as stoves, ovens, broilers, or other devices, as well as

154.02   Definitions
   
154.03   Minimum proximity requirements
Cross-reference:
   Adult Entertainment Business Regulations, see Ch.
118
§ 154.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of this chapter to prevent community-wide adverse economic
impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of
neighborhoods, which can be brought about by the concentration of adult
entertainment businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other
incompatible uses, such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially
zoned districts or uses. The City Council finds that it has been demonstrated
in various communities that the concentration of adult entertainment businesses
causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in
crime, and in addition to the effects described above, can cause other
businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of
this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
concentration of adult entertainment businesses or their close proximity to
incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult businesses in certain
areas.

cover;
         (c)   Lowering heating and cooling costs by promoting the conservation
of energy resources and regulation of temperature through the shade,
evaporative cooling and wind break provided by trees;
         (d)   Reducing topsoil erosion by the holding effect of their roots;
         (e)   Promoting conservation of water resources by reducing surface
water runoff resulting from storms;
         (f)   Promoting the well being of the community by absorbing sound and
buffer noise, such as vehicular traffic;

§ 157.05 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Required. In the following designated districts, not less than the
stipulated percent of gross site area shall be landscaped in accordance with
this section:
Landscape Area Requirements
Zone District Required Landscaping (Gross % of site)
Landscape Area Requirements
Zone District Required Landscaping (Gross % of site)
R-1/PD        30
R-2           30 (a)
R-3           30 (a)
C-1/PD        10 (c)

M-2           7.5 (b) 5 (c)
CX-1          10 (c)
 
      (1)   In multiple-family developments of 12 or more dwelling units, 10%
of the total building site shall be set aside and landscaped for the purposes
of common recreational open space. Such 10% may be included in the general
landscaping requirements.
      (2)   This requirement may be waived by the Community Development
Director for remodeling, alterations, or renovations to existing buildings and
developments on parcels or building sites where an existing building occupies a
substantial portion of the site and there exists limited space to landscape
because of the front yard or corner street side yard setback areas.
      (3)   In commercial and industrial districts, where a lot larger than
10,000 square feet is to be developed in phases, the Community Development
Director may determine that only the developed portion of the site need be
landscaped. Provision shall be made, however, to insure that the landscape
requirement can still be met upon full development of the site. This exception
shall not apply to any setback along a public street which shall be landscaped
upon the initial development of the site. Open areas (areas not landscaped)
shall be continuously maintained free of weeds, litter and debris, and shall
not become a source of nuisance to adjoining property.
   (B)   Determination of landscaped areas. In determining landscaped areas,
setbacks, when landscaped, private patios and all other areas not occupied by
buildings, parking lots, vehicle storage areas, and driveways shall be
included. Areas occupied by clubhouses, recreation buildings, pools, saunas,
inter walkways, and similar amenities may be included as landscaped areas. In
industrial zoning districts, areas planted along a public right-of-way shall
qualify as one and one-half (1.5) times the area toward the overall required
landscaping area.
   (C)   Landscape materials and placement. All landscape areas shall
demonstrate a recognizable pattern or theme for the overall development. To
accomplish this, new landscaping and landscape areas shall conform to the
following:
      (1)   Plant materials shall be selected for maintenance efficiency,
drought tolerance and adaptability and relationship to Riverbank's environment
and climate. Trees and shrubs in reasonable numbers shall be used in the
landscape design; ground cover alone shall not be acceptable. No one species of
plant shall exceed 20% of the plant material. Landscaped areas shall
incorporate a minimum of two of the following plantings: (1) grasses and ground
covers, (2) shrubs, and (3) trees.
      (2)   In all commercial (C) and industrial (M) districts, plant materials
shall be sized and spaced to achieve immediate effect and shall normally not be
less than 24-inch box for parking lot shade trees, 15 gallon container for
trees, five gallon container for shrubs, and a one gallon container for mass
planting. Non-turf areas, such as shrub beds, shall be top dressed with a bark
chip mulch or approved alternative.
      (3)   Turf shall be limited to 25% of the total landscaped area in all
commercial (C) and industrial (M) districts. In residential districts turf
shall not exceed 50% of the total landscaped area.
   (D)   Landscape irrigation. Provisions shall be made for a permanent "in
place" irrigation system to all landscaped areas required herein, including
street tree wells. All new irrigation systems shall use Xeriscaping principles
including such techniques and materials as low precipitation sprinkler heads,
bubblers, drip irrigation systems, timing devices and moisture sensors. All
irrigation systems must be designed to comply with the "State Model Water
Efficient Landscape Ordinance" and shall minimize overspray onto impervious
surfaces, such as building, sidewalks, parking areas, and the like, through the
use of such techniques as low-trajectory spray nozzles or underground low
volume applicators. All irrigation system controllers shall be set in
compliance with the day and hour watering requirements of the city and shall be
designed to minimize water use by installing automatic systems such as multi-
start controllers and soil moisture sensors.
   (E)   Site preparation and installation.
      (1)   Prior to the planting of any materials, the compacted soils
surrounding a building site will be returned to a friable condition. Friable
condition shall mean returning the soil to an easily crumbled or loosely
compacted condition down to a minimum depth per planting material requirements,
whereby the root structure of newly planted material will be allowed to spread
unimpeded. The soil must be returned to a friable condition to a minimum depth
as required for the planting material.
      (2)   Trees should be adequate in trunk diameter to support the top area
of the tree. Trees, shrubs, and vines should have body and fullness that is
typical of the species.
      (3)   All ground cover should be healthy, densely foliated, and well
rooted cuttings, or one-gallon container plants.
      (4)   The spacing of trees and shrubs should be appropriate to the
species used. The plant materials should be spaced so that they do not
interfere with the adequate lighting of the premises or restrict access to
emergency apparatus such as fire hydrants or fire alarm boxes. Proper spacing
should also insure unobstructed access for vehicles and pedestrians in addition
to providing clear vision of the intersections from approaching vehicles. Plant
material should conform to the following spacing standards:
         (a)   A minimum of 25 feet from the property corner at a street
intersection to the center of the first tree or large shrub.
         (b)   A minimum of 15 feet between center of trees and large shrubs to
light standards.
         (c)   A minimum of 15 feet between center of trees or large shrubs and
fire hydrants.
         (d)   A minimum of 15 feet from the intersection of a driveway with a
street right-of-way to the center of any tree having a diameter larger than 18
inches at maturity or large shrub.
   (F)   Maintenance. Required planting areas shall be permanently maintained.
As used in this section, "maintained" includes: watering, weeding, pruning,
insect control, and replacement of plant materials and irrigation equipment as
needed to preserve the health and appearance of plant materials.
   (G)   Parking lot landscaping. Parking lots and parking structures shall
have interior and perimeter landscaping areas as prescribed by the following:
      (1)   Parking lots or parking structures adjoining street property lines
or public streets shall have a perimeter landscape buffer with a minimum width
as follows:
         (a)   If abutting an expressway: 20 feet.
         (b)   If abutting an arterial: 15 feet.
         (c)   If abutting a collector: 15 feet.
         (d)   If abutting a local collector: 10 feet.
         (e)   If abutting a local street: five feet.
      (2)   Vehicle overhang may encroach a maximum of two feet into landscape
areas which are a minimum of ten feet wide.
      (3)   An average three foot high (minimum two and one-half foot and
maximum three and one-half foot) continuous screen shall be installed between
all parking areas and public streets. A screen shall consist of one or any
combination of the following:
         (a)   Walls. A wall shall consist of concrete, concrete block, stone,
brick, tile or similar type of solid masonry material.
         (b)   Berms. A berm shall be constructed of earthen materials and it
shall be landscaped.
         (c)   Solid fences. A solid fence shall be constructed of wood, or
other materials.
         (d)   Plant materials. Vegetation, consisting of trees or shrubs.
      (4)   Interior landscaped areas shall be a minimum of five feet in width,
exclusive of curbs.
      (5)   The end of each row of parking stalls shall be separated from aisle
ways by a landscaped planter or sidewalk.
      (6)   In all parking lots with a capacity of five parking spaces or more,
a minimum of one shade tree for every five spaces shall be provided in
landscape islands within the parking lot. Tree spacing shall be such that every
designated parking space is within 30 feet of the trunk of a tree.
      (7)   All planting areas within or abutting a parking lot shall be
protected with raised concrete curbs.
   (H)   Landscaping in rights-of-way. All land area within the public right-
of-way adjoining all sides of any parcel or building site that is not otherwise
covered with a building, structure, paving, or similar impervious surface shall
be landscaped and maintained in conjunction with the landscaping installed on
the adjoining property as regulated in this chapter. Landscaping within the
right-of-way shall not be used when determining the required percentage of
landscaping area as required in this chapter.
      (1)   Design. The design of the landscaping of the public right-of-way
shall be included in the landscape plan and shall meet the requirements set
forth in this chapter. Adequate space shall be provided in the landscape area
to allow free, unrestricted growth and development of the landscaping and
street trees.
      (2)   Street trees. Street trees shall be planted in accordance with the
Theme Street List, as it may be amended from time to time, or as otherwise set
forth in the
Chapter 96: Trees relating to street trees and in accordance with the street
tree planting standards as established by the City Engineer.
   (I)   Driveway and corner visibility. All landscaping material shall be
maintained in accordance with the provisions of §
96.12.
   (J)   Landscaping along walls. All solid walls over three feet in height
that are adjacent to public streets or right-of-ways shall comply with one of
the following:
      (1)   Be fully landscaped with vines and/or other plant materials to
prevent the placement of graffiti. All landscaping shall include the
installation of a permanent irrigation system.
      (2)   If not landscaped, shall be constructed of split-face concrete,
brick or some other type of material that will discourage the placement of
graffiti.
   (K)   Landscape screening of Residential (R) properties. Where a commercial
or industrial site adjoins a Residential (R) District, screening which is at
least 75% opaque shall be provided. Where fences are required, such fencing
shall be landscaped as appropriate.
   (L)   Model homes. To promote landscape water conservation through
education, all single family residential developments with more than two model
homes to be constructed by a developer, shall provide for landscaping the
