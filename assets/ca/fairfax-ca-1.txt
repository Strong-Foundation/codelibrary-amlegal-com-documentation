§ 1.10.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT.

quality of life. The Town Council has determined that there is a need for
alternative methods of code enforcement and that a comprehensive code
enforcement system uses a combination of criminal, civil, and administrative
remedies to gain compliance with code regulations.

   (B)   A request for a preliminary review shall be made in writing and filed
with the Town Clerk and shall include all information that the responsible
person desires the preliminary reviewing authority to consider in his or her
preliminary review of the citation. A request for preliminary review may

deposit the fine imposed by the administrative citation.
   (C)   The preliminary review shall be conducted by the preliminary reviewing
authority.
   (D)   The preliminary review shall include a review of the notice of

request.

review within seven calendar days of filing a written request for preliminary
review. The decision on a preliminary review is not a final disposition and

compliance, the due date of any fine imposed, or the time to request an
administrative hearing.
   (G)   If the preliminary reviewing authority concludes that no code
violation occurred or that the responsible person was not responsible for the
code violation, then he or she shall dismiss the notice of violation and/or
administrative citation, without prejudice to the issuance of a further notice
of violation and/or administrative citation should additional evidence be
developed.
   (H)   The preliminary reviewing authority shall also rule whether the
responsible person qualifies for waiver of the fine deposit, if such a request
has been made.
(Ord. 745, passed 9-2-2009)
§ 1.10.160 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.
   (A)   A cited person may request an administrative hearing. Such request
must be filed within 20 calendar days of the issuance of the first
administrative citation. Failure to request a hearing before the deadline, or
failure to comply with all the terms for requesting a hearing, constitutes an
abandonment of such request and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
   (B)   A request for an administrative hearing shall be made in writing and
filed with the Town Clerk, and shall include any grounds which the responsible
person wishes the town to consider. Unless waived upon preliminary review, the
request shall be accompanied by a deposit of the full amount of the fine, plus
any penalties imposed by the administrative citation in the event the fine has
not yet been paid.
   (C)   A cited person may request one continuance of a hearing provided he or
she does so in writing before the date of the hearing and states a reasonable
basis for the request. Unless the town issues a written notice of continuance,
the hearing shall take place on the date, time and location specified in the
notice of hearing transmitted to the cited person. A cited person's failure to
attend a hearing shall constitute an abandonment of the request for the hearing
and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
(Ord. 745, passed 9-2-2009)
§ 1.10.170 HEARING PROCESS.
   (A)   The hearing shall be conducted by the hearing authority on the date,
time, and location specified in the notice of hearing transmitted to the cited
person.

reports prepared by an enforcement officer concerning a code violation shall be
accepted by the hearing authority as prima facie evidence of the facts stated
in such documents.
   (C)   The hearing authority shall allow the cited person an opportunity to
testify at the hearing and to present evidence about any code violation
specified in the notice of violation or administrative citation.
   (D)   The enforcement officer or other representatives of the town may, but
are not required, to attend the hearing.
   (E)   The hearing authority may continue a hearing from time to time and may
allow a responsible person additional time to remedy a violation. In addition,
the hearing authority may request additional information or evidence from the
cited person.
   (F)   All hearings shall be recorded on a video or audio device, unless the
Town elects to use a court reporter. If a court reporter is not used, the town
need not provide transcripts of any hearings, but, within 15 calendar days
after payment of reasonable duplication fee, shall make the video and/or audio
recordings available to the responsible person. If a court reporter is used, a
recipient of the administrative citation may obtain a copy of the transcript
upon payment of any applicable fees or costs.
   (G)   A hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the technical rules
of evidence. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is evidence on which
reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,
regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might
consider such admission improper in a civil action. Irrelevant or unduly
repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
   (H)   After considering all testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing,
the hearing authority shall issue a written decision to affirm, modify or
dismiss the administrative citation. The decision shall include the hearing
authority's findings, as well as information regarding the cited person's right
to seek judicial review of the decision and the time in which to do so. The
town shall issue the cited person a copy of the hearing authority's written
decision (the "notice of decision"). The decision of the hearing authority
shall be final.
   (I)   If the hearing authority determines that the administrative citation
should be affirmed, the fine and/or penalty amount of deposit with the town
shall be retained by the town.
(Ord. 745, passed 9-2-2009)
§ 1.10.180 CONSIDERATION IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS.
   The Town Council, Planning Commission or other similar body, or town staff
may consider the fact that a person has been issued an administrative citation
when determining whether to grant, suspend, revoke, or deny to that person any
permit, license, or other approval, regarding a matter related to the condition
causing the code violation, and may consider such administrative citation to be
evidence that the person has committed acts that threaten the health, safety,
and welfare of the general public.
(Ord. 745, passed 9-2-2009)
§ 1.10.190 APPEAL TO TOWN COUNCIL; JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   (A)   A person whose administrative citation is affirmed by the hearing
officer pursuant to §
1.10.180 may appeal the decision of the hearing officer to the Town Council in
accordance with
Chapter 2.44 of the Town Code.
   (B)   A person who loses on appeal to the Town Council may file a petition
for review with the Superior Court, pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.4
within 20 calendar days after service of a copy of the notice of decision. In
any such action, the prevailing party shall have the right to recover
reasonable attorney fees and cost.

   It shall be the duty of the owner, and of the responsible party occupying or
having charge or control of any parcel of land, improved or unimproved, to
maintain such parcel of land free of any nuisance and/or nuisance conditions at

public land, related to any vehicle, vessel, structure, machinery, container,
refuse, debris or other item found to be or having been under the charge or
control of a property owner, responsible party, or last registered or
documented owner. Any owner or responsible party shall be responsible for the

such removal or correction.

§ 1.12.057 INITIAL STAFF INVESTIGATION.
   When the Director of Public Works (“Director”) or Building Official becomes
aware of the possible existence of a nuisance in the town, where feasible the
Director or Building Official, or his or her designee, shall contact the owner

voluntary compliance with this code.

§ 1.12.060 ATTORNEYS’ FEES.
   Notwithstanding anything in this code to the contrary, the town may only
recover its attorneys’ fees in any action, administrative proceeding or special
proceeding commenced by the town to abate a public nuisance, to enjoin
violation of any provision of this code, including its adopted codes, or to
collect a civil debt owing to the town, if the town elects, at the initiation
of that individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorneys’
fees. In these cases, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all
costs incurred therein, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit.
In no action, administrative proceeding or special proceeding shall an award of
attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable
attorneys’ fees incurred by the town in the action or proceeding. The town is
the prevailing party if any portion of the notice to abate is upheld.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.065 NOTICE TO ABATE NUISANCE CONDITIONS.
   (A)   When the enforcement officer finds that a nuisance condition exists
upon any property in the town, he or she may, or upon the direction of the Town
Council shall, serve a notice to abate upon all owners and all responsible
parties, directing them to abate or cause the nuisance condition(s) upon the
premises to be abated on or before a specified compliance date. When ordering
abatement of a nuisance, the enforcement officer may order a condition to be
abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, removal or termination. The
notice shall also state that any owner or responsible party may file a written
request for a hearing with the Town Clerk to dispute the alleged conditions
within ten days of service of the notice.
   (B)   All owners and responsible parties must be served with the notice to
abate in the manner required by §
1.12.070 (“Methods of Service”).
   (C)   The procedure in division (A) does not apply to public nuisances
constituting an imminent hazard. In such instances, the provisions in §
1.12.115 shall be followed.
   (D)   An owner or responsible party may appeal a notice to abate by filing a
written request for an appeal with the Town Clerk within ten days of service of
the notice to abate. The written appeal shall identify the property address,
specify the grounds for the appeal, list the date of the notice to abate being
appealed from and be signed by the appellant. In the event an owner or
responsible party files a timely request for hearing, the Town Clerk and
hearing officer shall schedule the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted no
later than 60 days of receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the parties. The Town Clerk shall send written notice of the
location, time and date of the hearing at least ten days in advance of the
hearing date.
   (E)   Failure of any owner or responsible party to timely appeal the notice
to abate constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal a notice to abate or seek
judicial review, and the nuisance conditions shall be deemed confirmed. Such
failure shall also constitute a failure to exhaust available administrative
remedies. If the owner or responsible party fails to appeal the notice and if
the nuisance condition has not been abated on or before the compliance date,
the enforcement officer may, without any administrative hearing, cause the
abatement of the nuisance condition upon the premises.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.070 METHODS OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Any notice or document required to be served under this chapter may be
served by certified mail with return receipt requested, by first class mail, or
by personal service. Service is deemed effective on the date it is personally
delivered or placed in a U.S. Postal Service receptacle.
   (B)   Any notice or document issued to an owner must be sent to the mailing
address on the last equalized assessment roll of the Marin County Assessor’s
Office, and the notice must be sent to the property address and posted at or
upon the main entrance of the building or structure or at another prominent
location on the real property.
   (C)   If there is no known address for any responsible party, the notice
must be sent to the property address and posted at or upon the main entrance of
the building or structure or at another prominent location on the real
property.
   (D)   Failure of any owner or responsible party to receive a document
properly served pursuant to this chapter does not affect the validity of the
notice or document, service, or any action or proceeding pursuant to this
chapter.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.075 MANNER OF CONDUCTING ABATEMENT HEARING.
   In the event a hearing is timely requested pursuant to §
1.12.065, the hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the following procedures:
   (A)   At the time and place designated in the notice of hearing, the hearing
officer shall hear and consider all relevant evidence, including but not
limited to, applicable staff reports, oral evidence, physical evidence and
documentary evidence regarding the alleged nuisance, and proposed method of
abatement. The hearing may be continued from time to time.
   (B)   Failure of the owner or responsible party to appear at the hearing
shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and an admission by the
owner or responsible party of the existence of the nuisance condition charged.
In the event of such failure to appear, the hearing officer may order that the
nuisance condition be abated by the enforcement officer. Such failure to appear
shall also constitute a failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.
   (C)   The Town shall bear the burden of proof to demonstrate, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that a nuisance exists and that the proposed
mechanism for abatement is appropriate, if specified in the notice to abate.
The issuance of a notice to abate constitutes prima facie evidence of the
existence of a violation. The town need not demonstrate that the proposed
mechanism for abatement is either the most appropriate or least expensive.
   (D)   The hearing shall not be conducted according to the formal rules of
evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence
on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious
affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which
might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil
actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state. However, irrelevant
or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
   (E)   Prior to conclusion of the hearing, if the owner or responsible party
is present, the hearing officer may request the owner or responsible party to
sign a consent to enter and perform work. The permission given shall be used
only if the nuisance condition is determined to exist and is not abated by the
schedule of correction specified in the hearing officer’s decision.
   (F)   If the owner or responsible party does not provide written consent,
entry onto the property may be made by obtaining verbal permission from the
owner or a responsible party, or by means of an inspection or abatement
warrant, or by any other lawful manner.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.080 ISSUANCE OF DECISION, FINDINGS AND ORDER.
   (A)   Within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing
officer shall issue a written decision. The decision shall set forth the
factual findings made by the hearing officer, a conclusion as to whether a
nuisance condition exists, the manner of abatement, including an order that
such nuisance (if one is found to exist) be abated by the town and a schedule
of correction or the date by which the abatement shall be completed.
   (B)   If the hearing officer determines that a nuisance exists which has not
been corrected within the time period specified in the notice to abate nuisance
conditions, the hearing officer shall so find in the decision, and may include
in the decision any or all of the following:
      (1)   An order to correct, including a schedule of correction where
appropriate;
      (2)   An order to pay administrative costs as provided in §
1.12.095 of this chapter.
   (C)   Failure to issue a decision in ten days shall not affect the validity
of such decision.
   (D)   The decision shall be mailed by certified mail with a return receipt
requested to the owner and shall be mailed to the enforcement officer. A copy
of a summary of the decision and any order it contains shall also be posted on
the property by the enforcement officer in a conspicuous location.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.085 ABATEMENT BY ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IF NUISANCE IS NOT ABATED.
   (A)   In the event that the owner or responsible party fails to appeal the
notice to abate, or upon receipt of the hearing officer’s decision if: (i) no
schedule of correction has been issued; or (ii) upon the failure of the owner
and responsible part to comply with such schedule if a schedule was included,
and if the nuisance condition has not been abated the enforcement officer shall
forthwith abate, or cause to be abated, the nuisance condition upon the
premises. The enforcement officer is authorized to enter upon private property
for this purpose, consistent with the provisions of the U.S. Constitution.
   (B)   The cost of abatement shall become a personal obligation of the owner
and responsible party and may be collected in any legal manner, expressly
including as lien or special assessment pursuant to the procedures set forth in
this chapter. The cost of abatement of any public nuisance may include:
inspection costs; investigation costs; boundary determination and measurement
costs; attorneys’ fees and costs; clerical and associated administrative costs;
and costs to repair and eliminate all substandard conditions, including costs
of consultants and private contractors.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.090 ABATEMENT BY OWNER/RESPONSIBLE PARTY.
   (A)   Any owner or responsible party may, at his, her, or its own expense
and prior to the scheduled abatement hearing, abate a declared nuisance
condition in accordance with the provisions of the notice sent by the
enforcement officer; provided that all necessary permits are first obtained. If
the enforcement officer determines that the nuisance condition has been abated
prior to the hearing, the hearing proceedings shall be terminated. If any
abatement referenced in this section takes place after the specified compliance
date, but prior to date set for hearing, termination of the hearing shall only
take place upon the owner or responsible party’s payment of outstanding
penalties, administrative and/or abatement costs, including attorneys’ fees if
applicable.
   (B)   Any owner or responsible party may also request the town to abate a
declared nuisance condition on his, her or its property. However, the owner or
responsible party making the request shall be responsible for the payment of
all penalties, abatement costs and/or administrative costs, including
attorneys’ fees if applicable, incurred by the town. The request for the town
to perform the abatement shall be in writing and include a written consent to
enter and perform work. Any such request shall be deemed an agreement to pay
for the costs of such abatement, including but not limited to any penalties,
administrative costs, and an agreement that such costs may be collected as a
lien or special assessment upon the property. The abatement hearing proceedings
shall thereafter be terminated.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.095 LIABILITY FOR ABATEMENT COSTS.
   (A)   In addition to liability for the costs of abatement itself pursuant to
§
1.12.085 and this section of this chapter, the owner and responsible party
shall be jointly and severally liable for any expenses and administrative costs
incurred by the town, county or any related agency incurred after the initial
inspection and identification of the nuisance.
   (B)   The administrative costs may include any and all fees and costs
incurred by the town in connection with the matter before the hearing officer,
including but not limited to, costs of investigation, town staffing costs
incurred in preparation for the hearing and for the hearing itself, fees and
costs of the town’s consultants, and costs for all re-inspections necessary to
enforce the notice to abate nuisance conditions.
   (C)   In the event that the town is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees
and costs pursuant to §
1.12.060, such fees and costs shall be collected at the same time and pursuant
to the same procedures as administrative costs pursuant to this section.
   (D)   The enforcement officer or other authorized town official shall keep
an itemized report of the costs incurred by the town in the abatement of any
public nuisance. The owner and responsible party shall be invoiced for the
total. If payment is not received, the itemized report shall be submitted in
writing to the Town Clerk no sooner than 20 days of the invoice date.
In the event the invoice is not paid within 30 days, the town may collect all
such abatement costs and interest through a lien or special assessment under §§
1.12.100 and
1.12.105.
   (E)   All abatement costs shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent per
annum from the date of abatement.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.100 LIEN PROCEDURE.
   In the event the town decides to collect abatement costs as a lien, it shall
impose such lien pursuant to this section:
   (A)   Upon receipt of the itemized report, the Town Clerk, or his or her
designee, shall serve notice of the lien upon all owners in the same manner as
summons in a civil action in accordance with Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §
415.10 et seq. or otherwise as provided by Cal. Government Code § 38773.1, as
may be amended from time to time. If the owner of record, after diligent search
cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a
conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and publication
thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in Marin County. The period of
notice commences upon the first day of publication and terminates at the end of
the tenth day, including therein the first day. Publication shall be made on
each day on which the newspaper is published during the ten-day period.
   (B)   The notice shall inform the owner of the pending lien and inform the
property owner of the public hearing where the Town Council will consider
imposing the itemized report as a lien against the property. The hearing shall
be conducted no less than ten days from service of the notice.
   (C)   At the hearing and after considering the relevant evidence, including
any evidence or objections of the owners as to the itemized report, the Town
Council may adopt a resolution confirming the itemized report and directing the
Town Clerk to record a lien against the property in the Marin County Recorder’s
office and, from the date of recording, shall have the force, effect and
priority of a judgment lien.
   (D)   The lien shall identify:
      (1)   The amount of the lien;
      (2)   The town as the agency on whose behalf the lien is imposed;
      (3)   The date of the abatement order or citation;
      (4)   The street address, legal description and assessor’s parcel number
of the parcel on which the lien is imposed; and
      (5)   The name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel.
   (E)   In the event that the lien is discharged, released or satisfied,
through either payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge, release, or
satisfaction containing the information specified in division (D) shall be
recorded by the Town Clerk.
   (F)   A lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the town for a money
judgment.
   (G)   The town may recover from the property owner any costs incurred in the
processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner
as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.105 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE.
   In the event the town decides to collect abatement costs as a special
assessment, it shall impose such special assessment pursuant to this section:
   (A)   Upon receipt of the itemized report, the Town Clerk shall provide
written notice of the special assessment to all owners by certified mail if the
property owner’s identity can be determined from the County Assessor’s or
County Recorder’s records, or as otherwise provided by Cal. Government Code §
38773.5, as may be amended from time to time. The notice shall inform the owner
of the pending special assessment, and the date, time and location of the
public hearing where the Town Council will consider imposing the itemized
report as a special assessment against the property, and that the property may
be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent
assessments. The hearing shall be conducted no less than ten days from service
of the notice.
   (B)   At the hearing and after considering the relevant evidence, including
any evidence or objections of the owners as to the itemized report, the Town
Council may adopt a resolution confirming the itemized report and assessing the
report as a special assessment against the property. The Town Clerk shall then
provide all documentation necessary to the county to enter such assessment.
After entry, the assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the
same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as
provided for ordinary municipal taxes. The property may be sold after three
years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax
collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property
owner to receive notice. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and
enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment.
However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been
transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a
bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior
to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become
delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the
real property but instead transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
   (C)   Subject to the requirements applicable to the sale of property
pursuant to Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code § 3691, the town may conduct a sale
of vacant residential developed property for which the payment of that
assessment is delinquent.
   (D)   Notices or instruments relating to the special assessment shall be
entitled to recordation with the Marin County Recorder’s Office. After
recordation, the special assessment may be foreclosed on as a lien in the
manner and means provided by law.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.110 ORDER FOR TREBLE COSTS OF ABATEMENT.
   Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a
two-year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a
condition that may be abated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter,
except for conditions abated pursuant to Cal. Health and Safety Code § 17980,
relating to abandoned buildings, the court may order the owner to pay treble
the costs of the abatement, as authorized by Cal. Government Code § 38773.7.
Costs of abatement shall include, without limitation by reason of enumeration,
all administrative costs of the town.
(Ord. 831, passed 5-1-2019)
§ 1.12.115 SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any provision of the code to the contrary, the Town
Manager, or his or her designee, may cause a public nuisance to be summarily
abated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section if it is
determined that the nuisance is immediately or potentially dangerous to the
life, health or safety of the occupants of the property or to the public.
   (B)   Actions taken to abate immediately or potentially dangerous nuisances
may include, but are not limited to, repair or removal of the condition
creating the danger and/or the restriction from use or occupancy of the
property on which the condition exists or any other abatement action determined
by the enforcement officer to be necessary. Where a residential rental property
is involved, this may require the moving and relocation of the occupants by the
owner and/or responsible party to other habitable temporary or permanent
accommodations. Any temporary accommodations will be maintained by the owner
and/or responsible party, at his, her or its expense, until the corrections are
done to the vacated residential property so that it is habitable and the
occupants are returned.
   (C)   Within ten days following summary abatement, or as soon thereafter as
reasonable possible under the circumstances, notice of the summary abatement
must be provided to all owners and responsible parties in the manner required
by §
1.12.070. The notice shall describe the condition and the reason it was
immediately or potentially dangerous, and a brief description of the actions
town personnel took to abate the dangerous condition. Such notice shall include
a provision authorizing the owner or responsible party to dispute the existence
of the nuisance conditions or the town’s determination that the condition was
immediately or potentially dangerous before the hearing officer. Any request
for an appeal shall be filed in writing with the Town Clerk within ten days of
the notice and shall be conducted in the same manner as all applicable
procedures under §§
1.12.075 through
1.12.080.
   (D)   Omission of any of the foregoing provisions in a notice of summary
abatement, whether in whole or in part, or the failure of an owner or
responsible party to receive this document, does not render it defective or
render any proceeding or action pursuant to this chapter invalid.
   (E)   The enforcement officer shall keep an itemized report of the costs
incurred by the town in the summary abatement. The costs and expenses for
summary abatement, if not paid by the property owner within 30 days of the date
of the invoice, shall be collected pursuant to the procedures set forth in §§
1.12.100 through
1.12.105 of this chapter.

   (A)   After confirmation of the report, the assessment shall be collected in
any of the following ways:
      (1)   The owner or occupant of the property described in the notice may
pay to the Town Treasurer the amount due on the abatement after the
confirmation of the report and until ten days before a copy of such report is
given to the County Assessor or, if certified copies were filed with the County
Auditor, until August 1 following the confirmation of the report.
      (2)   The County Assessor may collect the assessments by issuing separate
bills and receipts for the assessments, or the amount of the assessment may be

foreclosure and sale for delinquencies.
      (3)   Foreclosure of a nuisance abatement lien on the property.

§ 1.12.140 REFUNDS.
   The Town Council may order a refund of all or part of the assessment paid
pursuant to this chapter if it finds that all or part of the assessment had
been erroneously levied. An assessment or part thereof shall not be refunded
unless a claim is filed with the Town Clerk on or before six months after the
assessment became due and payable. Any claim shall be verified by the person
who paid the assessment, or his guardian, executor, or administrator.

§ 1.12.145 NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN.
   (A)   A nuisance abatement lien may be recorded in the Marin County
Recorder's office and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect,

   (B)   Prior to the recordation of the lien against the parcel of land on

of record of the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained, based on
the last equalized assessment roll, or the supplemental roll, whichever is more
current. Such notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil
action in accordance with Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 415.10 et seq. The
date upon which service is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of
the copy of the notice at the time of service. However, service of such notice

§ 1.12.150 SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   If, in the opinion of the Town Manager or his or her designee, there exists
a condition on any premises which is of such a nature as to be imminently
dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare, which if abated according to
the generally applicable procedures of this chapter would, during pendency of
the proceedings, subject the public to potential harm of a serious nature, the
same may be abated summarily without compliance with the provisions of this
chapter. As an alternative to summary abatement, the Town Attorney may
institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for the abatement of
any nuisance.

shall have the discretion to proceed under either or both of the alternative
processes.

electronically file a copy with the Town Clerk, or may file in a paper format.
   (D)   Paper filing when cannot file electronically. If, for technical
reasons, the town's system is not capable of accepting a particular type of
statement, report, form or other document, an elected officer, candidate,
committee, or other person shall timely file that document in paper format with
the Town Clerk.
   (E)   Internet posting of data. The Town Clerk shall ensure that the town's
system makes all electronically filed statements, reports, forms, or other
documents available on the internet in an easily understood format that
provides the greatest public access. The data shall be made available free of
charge and as soon as possible after receipt/deadline. The data made available
on the internet shall not contain the street name of the persons or entity
representatives listed on the electronically filed forms or any bank account
number required to be disclosed by the filer. The Town Clerk's office shall

(Prior Code, § 2.04.090) (Ord. 575, passed - -1988)
§ 2.08.090 COUNCIL PUBLIC ISSUE AGENDA POLICY.
   (A)   The Council shall have all legislative power of a city granted by the
California Constitution and applicable California Supreme Court decisions which
recognize "that as representatives of local communities, boards of supervisors
and city councils have traditionally made declarations of policy on matters of
concern to the community whether or not they had the power to effectuate such
declarations by binding legislation. Indeed one of the purposes of local
government is to represent its citizens before the Congress, the Legislature,
and administrative agencies in matters over which the local government has no
power." Farley v. Healey, 67 Cal 2d 325, 329 (1967). In accordance with these
principles, the Town Council hereby adopts an agenda policy that encourages
consideration of a broad range of public issues.
   (B)   The Town Council, recognizing that the health and welfare of the town
is inextricably intertwined with that of regional, state, national and
international communities and economies, hereby adopts an agenda policy which
encourages discussion of a broad range of proposed resolutions on public
issues, including those of regional, state, national and international concern.
Such resolutions may be transmitted to county, state or federal elected or
administrative officials as determined by the Council in the exercise of its
discretion. The Council may hear such items on its regular agenda or consent
calendar, or set a duly noticed special meeting to hear the item.
   (C)   In conformity with the procedural rules and substantive authority
granted to the Council by state law and the Town Code, the Council may place on
the agenda during a duly noticed meeting the discussion and consideration of
any issues of public concern, including those of regional, state, national or
international concern presented to it by the usual methods (including but not
limited to a resident's request at open time, by a letter to the Council, or
other means). In addition, the Council shall place on the agenda during a duly
noticed meeting the public discussion and consideration of any such issue of
public concern if presented with a residents’ petition signed by 25 residents
of the town urging consideration of the issue. If a residents' petition is
timely presented, the issue shall be placed on the agenda of the next regular
meeting of the Council. If such residents' petition is not presented in time to
be placed on the agenda for the next regular meeting, it shall be placed on the
next upcoming regular or special meeting agenda. The Council is authorized to
transmit resolutions passed under this section to the President, members of
Congress, the Governor, the California State Legislature and other governing
bodies and administrative agencies, as the Council deems appropriate in the
exercise of its discretion.
   (D)   In setting an issue on an agenda for consideration under this section,
the Council shall place the item after public hearings and agenda items of
exclusively local concern to Fairfax residents. This requirement does not,
however, diminish the authority of the Council to amend an agenda at a meeting
to advance, for public discussion, an issue of concern under this section.

§ 2.48.010 PURPOSE; FINDINGS.
   The Political Reform Act, Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 81000 et seq., requires state
and local government agencies to adopt and promulgate conflict of interest
codes. The Fair Political Practices Commission has adopted a regulation, 2 Cal.
Code of Regs. § 18730, which contains the terms of a standard conflict of
interest code, which can be incorporated by reference and may be amended by the
Fair Political Practices Commission to conform to amendments in the Political
Reform Act. Therefore, the terms of 2 Cal. Code of Regs. § 18730 and any
amendments to it duly adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission are
hereby incorporated by reference, and along with Exhibit “A” of the ordinance
codified herein, in which officials and employees are designated and in which
disclosure categories are set forth, shall constitute the “Conflict of Interest
Code of the Town of Fairfax,” which is considered the “Agency” within the
purview of this code. Exhibit “A” may be subsequently amended by Resolution of
the Fairfax Town Council. The Conflict of Interest Code of the Town of Fairfax
as so adopted amends and replaces any Conflict of Interest Code of the Town of
Fairfax previously in effect to conform to this newly adopted code.

   (A)   To adopt sales and use tax regulations which comply with the
requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code
Division 2, Part 1.5;
   (B)   To adopt sales and use tax regulations which incorporate provisions
identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the state, insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Division 2, Part 1.5;
   (C)   To adopt sales and use tax regulations which impose a one percent tax
and provide a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the
state’s Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practical to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the state’s Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the state sales and use taxes; and
   (D)   To adopt sales and use tax regulations which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Cal.
Revenue and Taxation Code Division 2, Part 1.5, minimize the cost of collecting
town sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
chapter.

§ 3.10.030 PURPOSE.

purposes:
   (A)   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with § 7251) of Division 2 of the Cal.
Revenue and Taxation Code and § 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which
authorizes the town to adopt this tax chapter which shall be operative if a
majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition
of the tax at an election called for that purpose.
   (B)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal.
Revenue and Taxation Code.
   (C)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that imposes a tax
and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the
State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use
Taxes.
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal. Revenue
and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use
taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

is the sole purpose and intent of this chapter to impose a special tax to
maintain 24-hour, seven days per week staffing of the Fairfax Police Station,
maintain fire services, provide funding for public works safety projects, and
enhance youth and senior programs. A citizens’ oversight committee was

manner, on the same dates, and shall be subject to the same penalties and
interest as other charges and taxes fixed and collected by the county on behalf
of the town. Said special tax, together with all penalties and interest
thereon, shall constitute a lien upon the parcel upon which it is levied until
it has been paid, and said special tax, together with all penalties and
interest thereon, shall, until paid, constitute a personal obligation to the
town by the persons who own the parcel on the date the tax is due.
(Ord. 786, passed 11-4-2014)
§ 3.20.070 AMENDMENT.
   The Town Council shall be empowered to amend this chapter by three
affirmative votes of its members to carry out the general purposes of this
chapter, to conform the provisions of this chapter to applicable state law, to
modify the methods of collection, or to assign the duties to public officials
under this chapter. In no event shall the Town Council amend this chapter to

§ 3.28.010 PROCEDURE.
   When the Police Department of the town has in its possession any personal
property, the ownership of which is unknown, the Department shall retain the
property in its possession for a minimum period of three months from the date
on which it came into possession of the Department, during which time the
members of the Department shall make reasonable effort to ascertain the
identity of the owner thereof, and, should the identity and address of the
owner be ascertained, shall give notice to the owner by registered mail of the
fact that the property is in the possession of the Department, and that the
owner, upon satisfactorily identifying himself or herself and his or her
ownership, will be entitled to receive the property. If, during the three-month
period, the Department is unable to ascertain the name and address of the owner
of the property, and no person or persons make claims thereto and prove their
ownership, then the Chief of Police shall cause the property to be sold, at
public auction, to the highest bidder, for cash, after having first given
notice of the time and place of the sale, for a minimum period of ten days
before the time fixed therefor, by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation printed in the county and distributed in the town. The notice shall
generally describe each specific item of property to be so sold. The cost of
the publication shall be a proper charge against the town and the proceeds from
the sale shall be deposited by the Chief of Police with the Town Treasurer as a
miscellaneous receipt.

§ 3.32.010 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by hotel users for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, bed and breakfast inn, tourist
home or house, motel, mobile home or other lodging. HOTEL shall not include any
structure, or any portion of any structure, exempted by the provisions of the
Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 7280 and 7281.
   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of
any room or rooms, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes.
   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sub-lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a
managing agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the managing
agent shall also be deemed an operator and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other entity.
   RENT. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   TRANSIENT. Changed to HOTEL USER. HOTEL USER means any person who exercises
occupancy, or is entitled to occupancy, by reason of concession, permit, right
of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar
days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such persons
occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a hotel user until the period
of 30 days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the
operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In
determining whether a person is a hotel user, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and
subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may
be considered.
(Prior Code, § 3.32.010) (Ord. 641, passed - -1995; Am. Ord. 669, passed - -
1997)
§ 3.32.020 TAX IMPOSED.
   (A)   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each hotel user is
subject to, and shall pay, a tax equal to the following percentage of the rent
charged by the operator:
      (1)   For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1997, at the rate of seven
percent of the rent charged;
      (2)   For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1998, at the rate of eight
percent of the rent charged;
      (3)   For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1999, at the rate of nine

      (4)   For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2000, and for each fiscal
year thereafter at the rate of ten percent of the rent charged.
   (B)   (1)   The tax constitutes a debt owed by the hotel user to the town
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the town. The hotel
user shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is
paid.
      (2)   If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the
tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
hotel user’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
      (3)   If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel, the Town Manager may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the
Town Manager.

§ 3.32.030 EXEMPTIONS.
   In addition to the exemptions provided for in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 7280 and
7281, no tax shall be imposed upon any person as to whom, or any occupancy as
to which, it is beyond the power of the town to impose the tax.

§ 3.32.040 OPERATOR’S DUTIES.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent, and at the same time, as the rent is collected from every hotel user.
The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent
charged and each hotel user shall receive a receipt for payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof, will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 3.32.040) (Ord. 641, passed - -1995; Am. Ord. 669, passed - -

§ 3.32.050 REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in
this chapter, or within 30 days after commencing business, whichever is later,
the operator of any hotel renting occupancy to hotel users shall register the
hotel with the town and obtain from the town a hotel users registration
certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled
the requirements of Chapter 3.32 of the Fairfax Town Code by registering with
the Town Manager for the purpose of collecting from hotel users the hotel users
tax and remitting that tax to the Town Manager. This Certificate does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to those
requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of the Town
of Fairfax.”
(Prior Code, § 3.32.050) (Ord. 641, passed - -1995; Am. Ord. 669, passed - -
1997)
§ 3.32.060 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (A)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Town Manager, make a return to the Town
Manager on forms provided by the town of the total rents charged and received
and the amount of tax collected for hotel user occupancies. The Town Manager
may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder, if
necessary, in order to insure collection of the tax and the Town Manager may
require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due
immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.
   (B)   All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be
held in trust for the account of the town until payment thereof is made to the
Town Manager.

   (A)   Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within
the required time shall pay an initial penalty of ten percent of the amount of
the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. Any operator who fails to remit
any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date
on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency
penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of
the tax and ten percent penalty first imposed.
   (B)   If the Town Manager determines that the non-payment of any remittance
due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount
of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the foregoing penalties. In
addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax
imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of 0.5 percent per
month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties,
from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. Every
penalty imposed and the interest as accrues under the provisions of this
section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.
(Prior Code, § 3.32.080) (Ord. 641, passed - -1995)
§ 3.32.090 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX.
   (A)   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make,
within the time required, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion
thereof, the Town Manager shall proceed in a manner as he or she may deem best
to obtain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the tax due. As
soon as the Town Manager shall procure the facts and information as he or she
is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make the report and remittance, the Town Manager shall proceed to
determine and assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties
provided for in this chapter.
   (B)   In case of the determination, the Town Manager shall give notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the U.S.
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last
known place of business.
   (C)   The operator may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of the
notice, make application, in writing, to the Town Manager for a hearing on the
amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined
by the Town Manager shall become final and conclusive and shall be immediately
due and payable. If such application is made, the Town Manager shall give not
less than five days written notice, in the manner prescribed herein, to the
operator to show cause, at a time; and place fixed in the notice, why the
amount specified therein shall not be fixed for the tax, interest and
penalties.
   (D)   At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the
hearing, the Town Manager shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and
shall, thereafter, give written notice to the operator, in the manner
prescribed in this section, of the determination and the amount of the tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
15 days.
(Prior Code, § 3.32.090) (Ord. 641, passed - -1995)
§ 3.32.100 RECORDS.
   It shall be the duty of every operator to keep and preserve, for a period of
three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of the tax
as the operator may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the
town, which records the Town Manager shall have the right to inspect at all
reasonable times.
(Prior Code, § 3.32.100) (Ord. 641, passed - -1995)
§ 3.32.110 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid,
or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the town under this chapter, it may be refunded as hereinafter set
forth provided a claim therefor, in writing, stating under penalty of perjury
the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Town
Manager within 90 days of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms
furnished by the Town Manager.
   (B)   An operator may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received, when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Town Manager that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a hotel user. Neither a refund, nor a credit shall be allowed
unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the hotel
user or credited to rent subsequently payable by the hotel user to the
operator.
   (C)   A hotel user may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more than
once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the town, by filing
a claim in the manner hereinabove set forth, but only when the tax was paid by
the hotel user directly to the Town Manager or when the hotel user, having paid
the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Town Manager
that the hotel user has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who
collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes the right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.

operator to the town. Any person owing money to the town under the provisions
of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the town
for the recovery thereof.

The tax and penalty shall bear interest at the same rate as the rate for unpaid
ad valorem tax until paid.
   (B)   Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed by this
chapter has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the town, it may be refunded provided a verified claim
in writing therefor, stating the specific ground upon which such claim is
founded, is filed with the Treasurer within one year of the date of payment.
The claim shall be filed by the person who paid the tax or such person's
guardian, conservator, or the executor of her or his estate and shall contain
the information required by Cal. Gov't Code § 910 for claims to which that
section applies. No claim may be filed on behalf of other taxpayers or a class
of taxpayers. If a claim is approved by the Town Council, the excess may be
refunded or may be credited against any amounts then due and payable from the
person from whom it was collected, and the balance may be refunded to such
person, his/her administrators or executors. Filing a timely and sufficient
claim shall be a condition precedent to legal action against the town for a
refund of the tax.

law governing the rents that may be charged for a rental unit that was adopted
after this measure was submitted for title and summary but prior to the
effective date of this act, and that is inconsistent with this provision, is
hereby repealed.

§ 5.56.070 REVIEW AND ACTION ON APPLICATIONS.
   The processing of new permit applications will include the following phases:
   (A)   Phase 1 — Prescreening and criminal history.
      (1)   Upon close of the application period, town staff shall review each
complete application for general compliance with the town's Municipal Code, and
shall reject any application which does not meet such requirements or is
incomplete. Rejected applications shall not be scored. The town shall also
disqualify any application that contains any false or misleading information.
      (2)   All exterior building improvements, including façade improvements
and proposed signage, shall be reviewed for conformance with the town's zoning
and land use standards. If required, the applicant shall apply for any design
review approval, traffic impact permit and/or sign permit necessary under
Chapters 17.020,
17.056 and/or
17.064 concurrently with the application for the commercial cannabis business
permit. The prescreening approval may be conditioned upon the applicant
submitting complete application materials for design review, traffic impact
and/or sign permits. All applications will be required to comply with
environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA") (Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.).
      (3)   Each applicant shall submit to the Chief of Police a recent
photograph of the applicant (if an individual), each owner and current or
prospective manager. The applicant, owner(s) and manager(s) shall also submit
fingerprints pursuant to "Livescan" procedures and pay all costs associated
with such submittal. Upon receipt of the Livescan results, the Chief of Police
shall review and report if the criminal history of the applicant, owner(s) and
manager(s) satisfies the minimum criteria pursuant to §
5.56.080.
      (4)   The applicant prescreening decisions will be made by the Town
Manager within 60 days of the close of the application period or receipt of
Livescan results, whichever is later. Only applicants who receive approval of
the prescreening review may proceed to the next phase of the selection process.
   (B)   Phase 2 — Application scoring.
      (1)   Upon approval of the prescreening review, the Town Manager or
designee shall refer the application to the Planning Commission for preliminary
scoring of the application(s) and recommendation to the Town Council. A public
hearing on a commercial cannabis business permit application(s) may be
consolidated with any required hearing for design review approval, traffic
impact permit and/or sign permits.
      (2)   The Town Council will issue the final score on the commercial
cannabis business permit application, relying only upon the written application
itself, any other written town materials generated in connection with the
review, and the applicant presentation and representations at the public
hearing. The decision of the Town Council will be made at a duly noticed public
hearing and may be consolidated with any required hearing for design review
approval, traffic impact permit and/or sign permits.
      (3)   The specific scoring criteria, weighting (points per criteria),
minimum qualifying scores and any additional application procedures will be
determined by resolution of the Town Council prior to the commencement of the
application period and posted publically on the town's website.
      (4)   If the number of applicants who receive minimum qualifying scores
at Phase 2 exceeds the maximum number of permits available, then applicants
will be selected and issued a commercial cannabis business permit based on
highest score.
      (5)   Qualified applicants that are not selected will be placed on a
qualified applicant list. Applicants placed on the qualified applicant list
will be notified when future applications are accepted. A qualified applicant
will remain eligible for three years.
   (C)   Issuance of a commercial cannabis business permit does not create a
land use entitlement. Furthermore, no permittee may begin operations,
notwithstanding the issuance of a permit, until all of the state and local laws
and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of this chapter
and of the permit, have been complied with and the town verifies such
compliance. The issuance of a commercial cannabis business permit does not
excuse compliance with any other requirement in the Zoning Ordinance or
Building Code. Any additional permits required may be obtained after the
business permit is issued but before operation.
   (D)   The town reserves the discretion to not grant any applications in the
interest of the health, safety, or general welfare of the town.
(Ord. 835, passed 9-4-2019)
§ 5.56.080 MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR ISSUANCE OF A PERMIT.
   (A)   The applicant, each owner, and any existing or prospective manager,
must be at least 21 years of age.

(Ord. 835, passed 9-4-2019)
§ 5.56.110 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   The Town Manager may suspend or revoke a commercial cannabis business
permit if any of the conditions identified in this section exist. On
determining that grounds for permit suspension or revocation exist, the Town
Manager shall serve the permittee with written notice of the proposed
suspension or revocation. The notice shall state the ground or grounds upon
which the decision is based, the effective date of the decision, the right of
the permittee to appeal the decision to the Town Council, and that the Town
Manager's decision will be final if no written appeal is timely submitted to
the town in accordance with §
5.56.140. The notice is effective within 15 days from the date of service of
the notice. If an appeal is timely and properly filed, then the effective date
of the notice is stayed.
   (B)   A permittee is subject to suspension or revocation of the permit, or
subject to other appropriate disciplinary action, for any of the following
causes arising from the acts or omissions of the permittee, or an employee,
volunteer worker, agent, owner, director or manager of a commercial cannabis
business:
      (1)   The permittee has made a false, misleading or fraudulent statement
or omission of facts in the application for a permit, or in any report or
record required to be filed with the city.
      (2)   The commercial cannabis business has been operated as a nuisance,
as defined in Fairfax Municipal Code or as defined in state law.
      (3)   A violation of any provision of this chapter, or any other
provision of the Municipal Code.
      (4)   There has been one or more violations of state law, including but

(Ord. 835, passed 9-4-2019)
§ 5.56.120 EXPIRATION.
   A permit shall expire if not in active use for a period of six months at any
time after the date of issuance. ACTIVE USE means conducting the commercial
cannabis activity authorized by the permit following receipt of a certificate
of occupancy, if required. This period may be extended if the permit has
applied for a state commercial cannabis license that has been delayed through
no fault of the permittee. Expired permits may not be renewed but the permit
holder may apply again when a permit vacancy occurs.
(Ord. 835, passed 9-4-2019)
§ 5.56.130 TRANSFER OF PERMITS.
   A commercial cannabis business permit issued under this chapter is valid
only as to the permittee and approved site, and is therefore nontransferable to
other persons or locations. A commercial cannabis business permit is not
property and has no value. A commercial cannabis business permit may not be
transferred, sold, assigned or bequeathed expressly or by operation by law. Any
attempt to directly or indirectly transfer a commercial cannabis business
permit shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of such permit and
such permit shall therefore be automatically rendered null and void. Except,
however, if the permittee is a partnership, corporation, limited liability
company or other entity, and one or more of the owners should die, one or more
of the surviving owners may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of
the deceased owner without affecting a surrender or termination of such permit
and in each case the permittee shall thereafter be deemed to be the surviving
owner(s). Additionally, a commercial cannabis business permit may be endorsed
to add an additional owner, provided such prospective new owner satisfies the
requirements for applicants, including but not limited to, a criminal history
check and the qualifications listed in §
5.56.080, as approved by the Town Manager.
(Ord. 835, passed 9-4-2019)
§ 5.56.140 APPEALS.
   (A)   Within 15 days after the date of service of a decision of the Town
Manager to revoke, suspend, deny renewal of a permit, or deny prescreening
review, the permittee or applicant may appeal such action by filing a written
appeal with the Town Clerk.
   (B)   The notice of appeal shall be in writing and signed by the person
making the appeal, or his or her legal representative, and shall contain the
following:
      (1)   The name, address, telephone number of the appellant.
      (2)   A true and correct copy of the notice of the decision issued by the
Town Manager from which the appellant is appealing.
      (3)   A specific statement of the reasons and grounds for making the
appeal in sufficient detail to enable the Town Council to understand the nature
of the controversy, the basis of the appeal, and the relief requested, not to
exceed five pages.
      (4)   All documents or other evidence pertinent to the appeal that the
appellant requests the Town Council to consider at the hearing.
   (C)   At the time of filing the appellant shall pay the designated appeal
fee, established by resolution of the Town Council from time to time.
   (D)   Failure of the Town Clerk to receive a timely and proper appeal, or
the requisite fee, constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal the decision of
the Town Manager and a failure to exhaust all administrative remedies. In this
event, the Town Manager's decision is final and binding.
   (E)   In the event a notice of appeal is timely filed, the Town Manager's
decision is stayed until a final order has been rendered and issued by the Town
Council. If a notice of appeal is not timely filed, in the event of a decision
of nonrenewal, the permit expires at the conclusion of the term of the permit
and in the event of a suspension or revocation, the suspension of revocation is
effective upon the expiration of the period for filing a written notice of
appeal.

be excluded.
   (I)   After the conclusion of the appeal hearing, the Town Council shall
determine if any grounds exists for the Town Manager's decision.
      (1)   If the Town Council determines that no facts exist to support the
Town Manager's decision, the Town Manager's notice of decision shall be deemed
cancelled.

Town Manager's notice of decision, the decision shall be upheld.
      (3)   The Town Council shall issue a written final order. The decision of
the Town Council shall be final and shall be served on the appellant. The
decision shall contain the following statement: "The decision of the Town
Council is final and binding. Judicial review of this decision is subject to
the time limits set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.6."

dining and other activities as determined by the Council, located within the
Town of Fairfax in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents and businesses within the town, and encourage development of a
pedestrian-friendly urban environment. Commercial outdoor dining and other uses
as determined shall comply with all provisions of the Fairfax Town Code, state
law, and all other applicable local codes and regulations, including all
applicable land use and zoning regulations imposed on commercial activities.
Such outdoor commercial activity shall be referred to as parklet(s).
(Ord. 868, passed 9-7-2022)

§ 5.58.090 BONDING AND INSURANCE.
   (A)   Upon issuance of a parklet permit in the public right-of-way pursuant

suspension proceeding before the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Upon initiation of a revocation or suspension proceeding, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing regarding the possible revocation or
modification of the parklet permit. Notice of such hearing shall be provided in
the same manner as the notice required for issuance of the original permit. The
Planning Commission, after such hearing, may revoke or suspend the parklet
permit if it determines that one or more of the following conditions exists:

§ 8.08.130 MANDATORY GARBAGE, RECYCLING AND ORGANIC MATERIALS COLLECTION.
§ 8.08.130-1 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The town finds that the State of California through its California
Waste Management Act of 1989 ("Act"), Cal. Public Resources Code § 40000, et
seq., as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced from time to time), as
implemented by regulations of CalRecycle, require the town to reduce, reuse,
and recycle (including composting), solid waste generated in the town to the
maximum extent feasible before any incineration or landfill disposal of waste,
to conserve water, energy, and other natural resources, and to protect the
environment. The Act and Alternative Compliance Act of 2008 (SB 1016, Statutes
of 2008), requires that each local jurisdiction in the state to divert 50% of
discarded materials from the landfill on a per capita basis.
   (B)   The town finds that every city and county in California, including the
town, could face fines for not meeting the above mandated goal.
   (C)   The town finds that Mandatory Commercial Recycling was one of the
measures adopted in the Assembly Bill 32 Scoping Plan by the Air Resources
Board (ARB) pursuant to the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Chapter
488, Statutes of 2006). The Mandatory Commercial Recycling Measure focuses on
increased commercial waste diversion as a method to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. It is designed to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of
5,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents. To achieve the
measure’s objective, an additional 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 tons of materials
annually will need to be recycled from the commercial sector by the year 2020
and beyond.
   (D)   AB 341 (Chapter 476, Statutes of 2011) that required any business that
generates four cubic yards or more of commercial solid waste per week or is a
multi-family residential dwelling with five or more units to arrange for
recycling collection services.
   (E)   Assembly Bill 1826 of 2014 requires businesses and certain multi-
family property owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid
waste, recycling, and organic materials per week to arrange for recyclable
materials and organic waste collection services for that waste and requires the
town to implement a mandatory commercial organics recycling program for
designated commercial property owners.
   (F)   SB 1383 required CalRecycle to develop regulations to reduce organics
in landfills and methane emissions. The SB 1383 Regulations require the town,
residential households, commercial businesses, commercial edible food
generators, haulers, self-haulers, food recovery organizations, and food
recovery services to support achievement of statewide organic waste disposal
reduction targets.
   (G)   The town continues to make progress in maintaining the disposal
reduction requirements of the state recycling law, but additional efforts,
particularly in the diversion of organic materials and the recycling of paper,
cardboard, glass, and other recyclable materials generated by commercial
businesses, will assist the town in maintaining and exceeding the goal of
diverting waste from landfill disposal. The town desires to implement a program
to further the Marin County Hazardous and Solid Waste Management Joint Powers
Authority (JPA) goal to increase the diversion of materials from the landfill
and transformation facilities to achieve an 94% diversion goal by 2025, ensure
that resources are used to their highest potential, reduce upstream waste and
reduce Marin's ecological footprint.
   (H)   The town finds that organic materials that are buried in the anaerobic
conditions of landfills creates methane gas and leachate that may impact air
and water quality. Reductions or capture of methane is critical as methane gas
from the decomposition of waste is a source of renewable energy, but if not
collected and controlled is at least 21 times as potent as carbon dioxide in
contributing to climate change.
   (I)   The town finds that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from solid
waste management can be realized by recovering traditional recyclable materials
from the waste stream to use in the manufacturing of products from these
materials. Traditional recyclable materials have significant intrinsic energy
value that displaces fossil fuel energy requirements when introduced back into
the manufacturing cycle. Additionally, by remanufacturing products using
recycled materials, additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are
realized through reduced fossil fuel demands in transportation and avoided
methane emissions at landfills.
   (J)   The town finds that efforts by the town and the private sector to
encourage voluntary diversion of commercial and special event recyclables
materials have not achieved desired levels of diversion.
   (K)   The town finds that mandatory commercial recycling programs in other
cities and counties in California, similar to the one implemented by this §
8.08.130, have proven successful.
   (L)   The town agrees to be subject to the terms of this chapter for all of
the town's commercial facilities and properties, including parks and town
buildings, as well as town-sponsored or partnered special events.

authorized to promulgate rules and regulations regarding any and all recyclable
materials containers including as related to the recyclable materials to be
placed therein, the placement and maximum weight of high-density materials for
collection and the proper use of collection containers.
   (E)   Each generator shall ensure that recyclable materials and organic
materials generated at the generator's site if self-hauled will be taken only
to an approved solid waste facility to ensure that the materials are recycled
or composted and not delivered to a landfill for disposal. No generator shall
dispose of, or arrange for disposal of, recyclable materials and organic

   (A)   The town may grant waivers for physical space limitations and/or de
minimis volumes. Waiver requests shall be submitted on a form specified by the
Director. After reviewing the waiver request, and after an on-site review, if
applicable, the Director may either approve or deny the following waiver
requests.
      (1)   De minimis waivers: The town may waive a commercial business'
obligation to comply with some or all the requirements of §
8.08.130-3 if the commercial business meets the following requirements:
         (a)   Submit an application specifying the type of waiver requested
and provide documentation as described below.
         (b)   Provide documentation that the commercial business (but
excluding multi-family residential dwellings) generates 32 gallons (or the
minimum level of service as defined in the rate schedule) of solid waste per
week and can demonstrate upon request by the town or hauler that they do not
exceed the 32 gallon threshold and have a reasonable alternative to disposing
of their recyclable materials or organic waste (e.g., sharing with adjacent
business). This exemption does not apply to special events unless the generator
demonstrates to the Director that the event will produce less than the
threshold amount.
         (c)   Notify the town if circumstances change such that subsections
(a) and (b) no longer apply, in which case the waiver will be rescinded.
         (d)   Provide written verification of eligibility for de minimis
waiver every five years if the town has approved de minimis waiver.
         (e)   The commercial business (but excluding multi-family residential
dwellings) may be exempt from the requirement of this section if the commercial
business demonstrates to the Director that there are no recyclable materials
and/or organic waste being generated by any activities in the commercial
business.
      (2)   Physical space waivers: The town may waive a commercial business'
or property owner's obligations to comply with some or all of the recyclable
materials and/or organic materials collection service requirements if the town
has evidence from its own staff, a hauler, licensed architect, or licensed
engineer demonstrating that the premises lacks adequate space for the
collection containers required for compliance with the collection service
requirements. If, after reviewing the site, the Director determines that it is
feasible for collection containers for recyclable materials and/or organic
materials to be placed either on-site or shared with an adjoining business or
property, then the generator will not be exempted from these requirements and
will be responsible for full compliance with this section. A commercial
business or property owner may request a physical space waiver through the
following process:
         (a)   Submit an application form specifying the type(s) of collection
services for which they are requesting a waiver from mandatory collection
service.
         (b)   Provide documentation that the premises lacks adequate space for

§ 8.08.130-13 IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Beginning January 1, 2022 and through December 31, 2023, the Town will
conduct inspections, remote monitoring, route reviews or waste evaluations, and
compliance reviews, depending upon the type of regulated entity, to determine
compliance with the SB 1383 regulations, and if the town determines that
organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, Tier One commercial edible food
generator, food recovery organization, food recovery service, or other entity
is not in compliance, it shall provide educational materials to the entity
describing its obligations under this chapter and a notice that compliance is
required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may be subject to
administrative civil penalties starting on January 1, 2024.
   (B)   The Director is authorized to administer and enforce the provisions of
this §
8.08.130, beginning with §
8.08.130-1 and following. The Director or anyone designated by the Director to
be an enforcement officer may exercise such enforcement powers. To the extent
permitted by law, the Director, authorized collector, or town's designee is
authorized to conduct any inspections, remote monitoring, or other
investigations as reasonably necessary to further the goals of this chapter,
subject to applicable laws. This may include inspections and investigations, at
random or otherwise, of any collection container, collection vehicle load, or
transfer, processing, or disposal facility to confirm compliance with this
chapter, subject to applicable laws. For the purposes of inspecting collection
containers for compliance, the town or authorized collector may conduct
container inspections for prohibited container contaminants using remote
monitoring, and generators shall accommodate and cooperate with the remote
monitoring. A commercial business (excluding private residential dwelling
units) shall cooperate with the town or authorized collector during such
inspections and investigations. Such inspections and investigations may include
confirmation of proper placement of materials in containers, inspection of
edible food recovery activities, review of required records, or other
verification or inspection to confirm compliance with any other requirement of
this chapter. Failure to provide or arrange for: (i) access to the premises;
(ii) installation and operation of remote monitoring equipment, if a remote
monitoring program is adopted; or (iii) access to records for any inspection or
investigation is a violation of this chapter and may result in penalties.
Nothing herein shall be read or interpreted to restrict franchisee/authorized
collector from conducting curbside audits of residential or commercial
containers that have been set out for collection.
   (C)   Any records obtained by the town, authorized collector, or town's
designee during inspections, investigations, remote monitoring and other
reviews shall be subject to the requirements and applicable disclosure
exemptions of the California Public Records Act as set forth in Cal. Gov’t Code
§§ 6250 et seq. 
   (D)   Unless otherwise expressly provided by the town's Code, any person
adversely and directly affected by any determination made or action taken by
the Director pursuant to the provisions of this section may file an
administrative appeal. If no appeal is filed within the time prescribed and
consistent with the town's procedures in the town's Code, the determination or
action of the Director shall be final.
   (E)   Incremental notification and enforcement.
      (1)    If an authorized collector first finds prohibited container
contaminants in a collection container, it shall notify the generator by
written notice attached to the collection container identifying the prohibited
container contaminants and describing what action must be taken for the
materials to be collected.
      (2)   If an authorized collector finds prohibited container contaminants
in a collection container a second time, they shall notify the generator by a
written "second notice" attached to the collection container and identifying
the prohibited container contaminants and describing what action must be taken
for the materials to be collected.
      (3)   After an authorized collector has already left two or more notices
for that customer and that type of collection container, the authorized
collector may refuse to empty the container if prohibited container
contaminants are found a third time, subject to 14 CCR Section 17331, or as
determined by the Director. If the collection container is not emptied, the
authorized collector must leave a tag and send a written notice to the
generator, identifying the prohibited container contaminants and describing
what action must be taken for the materials to be collected; provided, however,
that an authorized collector may not refuse on this basis to empty collection
containers from a multi-family residential dwelling or other commercial premise
with multiple tenants and joint account collection service due to prohibited
container contaminants, but may manage contaminated loads as garbage and charge
the generators accordingly.
      (4)   The authorized collector shall, in addition to the above, upon
request, provide to the Director a list of the names and addresses of those
generators who have received tags or notices or whose collection containers
have not been emptied due to non-compliance with this section, and copies of
the tags or notices. The authorized collector shall also provide to the
Director, upon request, a list of the names, addresses, and service levels of
the generators and any additional information required by the Director.
      (5)   A violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute an
infraction and will be grounds for issuance of a notice of violation and
assessment of an administrative citation and penalty by the town's enforcement
officer or its designated enforcement agency.
      (6)   Enforcement actions under this chapter are issuance of an
administrative citation and assessment of a fine. The town's procedures on
imposition of administrative citations and fines as contained in Municipal Code
Chapter 1.08,
1.10,
1.12 and
1.16 shall govern the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review of
administrative citations and fines issued to enforce this chapter and any rule
or regulation adopted pursuant to this chapter. Any section of this chapter may
be enforced by the town or, if agreed to, by its designated enforcement agency.
      (7)   A violation may be punishable by:
         (a)   A fine not exceeding $100 for a first violation;
         (b)   A fine not exceeding $200 for a second violation of the same
provision of this code within any 12 consecutive month period;
         (c)   A fine not exceeding $500 for each additional violation of the
same provision of this code within any 12 consecutive month period. Any
citation issued after the issuance of a third citation or violation of the same
provision of this code within any 12 consecutive month period may be charged as
a misdemeanor pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 1.08 of this code.
      (8)   The town or designated enforcement agency may issue a notice of
violation requiring compliance within 60 days or sooner of issuance of the
notice.
      (9)   Absent compliance by the respondent within the deadline set forth
in the notice of violation, the town or designated enforcement agency may
commence an action to impose penalties, via an administrative citation and
fine, pursuant to the town's standard procedures or the standard procedures of
its designated enforcement agency.

infraction; nor shall a conviction for such violation exempt any person from a
civil action brought by the town or its authorized collection agent(s). The

§ 8.14.010 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The town finds that the State of California through its California
Waste Management Act of 1989, Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939 passed and signed into
law in 1989) and Alternative Compliance Act of 2008 (SB 1016 passed and signed
into law in 2008), requires that each local jurisdiction in the state divert
50% of discarded materials from landfill garbage disposal on a per capita
basis.
   (B)   The town finds that every city and county in the state, including the
town, could face fines up to $10,000 a day for not meeting the above mandated
goal.
   (C)   The town finds that the state through its California Global Warming
Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32 passed and signed into law in 2006), requires that
commercial generators statewide participate in recycling programs.
   (D)   The town finds that in recent years, inerts and mixed construction and
demolition (C&D) debris constituted approximately 16% of the materials
landfilled in Marin County and a similarly large portion of the waste stream in
the town. These materials have significant potential for waste reduction and
recycling.
   (E)   The town finds that reusing and recycling C&D debris is essential to
further the town’s efforts to reduce waste and comply with AB 939, AB 32 and
other waste reduction goals.
   (F)   The town finds that C&D debris waste reduction and recycling have been
proven to reduce the amount of such material in landfills, increase site and
worker safety, be cost effective, and thereby assist in the protection of
public health, safety and welfare.
   (G)   The town finds that, except in unusual circumstances, it is feasible
to divert on average 100% asphalt and concrete, and at least 70% of all
remaining C&D debris from most construction, demolition, and renovation
projects.
   (H)   The town desires to implement a program to encourage the Marin County
Hazardous and Solid Waste Management Joint Powers Authority (JPA) goal to
increase the diversion of materials from landfill and transformation facilities
to achieve 80% diversion goal by 2012 and zero waste by 2025, ensure that
resources are used to their highest potential, reduce upstream waste, and
reduce the county’s ecological footprint.
   (I)   The town finds that, to ensure compliance with this chapter and to
ensure that those contractors that comply with the chapter are not placed at a
competitive disadvantage, it is necessary to impose a financial incentive as
set forth by resolution of the Town Council.
   (J)   The town finds that, to ensure compliance with this chapter,
facilities will be evaluated annually through an extensive certification
process conducted by the JPA.

8.16.110   Preemption
§ 8.16.010 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The Council finds as follows.
   (A)   California’s Integrated Waste Management Act requires all counties and
cities in California to develop and implement programs to divert from the
wastestream 25% of solid waste generated by 1995 and 50% by 2000; and solid
waste that is non- degradable or non-recyclable poses an acute problem for any
environmentally and financially responsible program of solid waste management.
   (B)    Products which are biodegradable or recyclable offer environmentally
sound alternatives to non-biodegradable and non-recyclable products currently
used. By decaying into their constituent substances, biodegradable products are
less of a danger to the natural environment, and less of a permanent blight on
the landscape.
   (C)   Take-out food packaging constitutes a major source of litter in
Fairfax and contributes to the total amount of waste entering the town’s waste
stream.
   (D)   Disposable plastic containers and wrappers used for take-out foods are
essentially not biodegradable and, as waste, do not decompose over time in the
natural environment; the use of these containers and wrappers has increased
annually. Polystyrene foam litter, in particular, is highly durable, buoyant
and non-biodegradable and therefore persists and detracts from the appearance
of the area longer than many other types of litter.
   (E)   Plastic litter, including polystyrene foam, poses a potential threat
to wildlife. It enters the marine and natural environment and is ingested by,
or entangles, aquatic wildlife, frequently causing death and damages the
ecological balance.
   (F)   Polystyrene foam is a petroleum processing by-product. Oil is a non-
renewable resource, which can only be obtained by increasingly hazardous
methods, such as off-shore drilling, which poses significant dangers to the
environment. Alternative products which are degradable or recyclable pose far
less overall hazards than continued and expanded reliance on oil-based
products.
   (G)   It is in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of all who
live, work and do business in the town that the amount of litter on the public
streets, parks, waterways, public places and open spaces be reduced.
   (H)   Although the waste stream within Marin County is large and diverse,
steps at the local level, no matter how small, can significantly support waste
management programs in lieu of landfilling.
   (I)   The provisions of this chapter are consistent with the county’s Solid
Waste Management Plan, and the legislative findings and intent of AB939.

8.18.090   Undertaking for the general welfare
§ 8.18.010 FINDINGS.
   (A)   General findings.
      (1)   Globally the production and use of plastic bags has significant
environmental impacts each year, including the use of over 12 million barrels
of oil, and the deaths of thousands of marine animals through ingestion and
entanglement.
      (2)   Each year, an estimated 500 billion to one trillion plastic bags
are used worldwide, which is over one million bags per minute, many of which
end up as litter each year.
      (3)   Most plastic carry-out bags do not biodegrade, but instead photo-
degrade, which means that the bags break down into smaller and smaller toxic
bits that enter the food web when animals mistake those materials for food.
      (4)   Because plastic does not biodegrade, every piece of plastic that
has found its way from California shores to the Pacific Ocean for the past 50
years still remains in the ocean or has been accumulating in the central
Pacific gyre and a "Pacific Garbage Patch" now exists made up of floating
plastic and Styrofoam debris. The remaining plastic is deposited on local or
distant shores.
      (5)   Plastic fragments act as "sponges" for dangerous compounds such as
Dichloro- diphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB), and
other toxic materials in ocean water. Plastics have been found to concentrate
these toxic chemicals at levels of up to one million times the levels found in
sea water.
      (6)   These highly contaminated fragments have been shown to cause
hormone disruption in the fish that ingest them, and in the humans that ingest
the fish.
      (7)   Data collected from the state's annual Coastal Cleanup and the 1999
Pilot Litter Study by the Department of Conservation "indicates that disposable
retail bags represent some of the most commonly littered items. Plastic bags
are easily carried by wind from uncovered trash and dumpsters, vehicles and
solid waste facilities including landfills."
      (8)   The US Marine Mammal Commission estimates that "257 marine species
have been reported entangled in or having ingested marine debris...the plastic
constricts the animals' movements and kills marine animals through starvation,
exhaustion or infection from deep wounds caused by tightening material. The
animals may starve to death as the plastic clogs their intestines preventing
them from obtaining vital nutrients. Toxic substances present in plastics are
known to cause death or reproductive failure in fish, shellfish and wildlife."
      (9)   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that over 52,000
tons of disposable bags were used in California in 2000 and less than 50 tons
were recovered for recycling.
      (10)   According to Californians Against Waste, over 19 billion
disposable plastic bags are generated in California every year, resulting in
over 147,000 tons of waste. An estimated 60% of these bags are generated by
grocery stores. These bags represent a disproportionately large share of litter
and marine debris according to a 1999 Department of Conservation study.
      (11)   The economics of recycling plastic bags are difficult to sustain,
due to the logistics of sorting, contamination of inks, and the overall low
quality of the plastic used in plastic bags, resulting in an estimated rate of
1% to 3% of all plastic bags being recycled in any way.
      (12)   Many plastic bags collected for recycling never get recycled but
instead get shipped to third world countries where less stringent environmental
laws permit cheap incineration which emits toxic chemicals which are known to
cause harm and injury to human health.
      (13)   While there are many serious negative environmental impacts from
the use of paper grocery bags as well, nonetheless, 45% of all paper products
are recycled while less than 5% of plastics are recycled.
      (14)   Almost all curbside pickup and recycling centers allow customers
to mix paper bags with newspapers for recycling but very few accept plastic
bags for recycling.
      (15)   The proliferation of plastic carry-out bags at retail stores of
all kinds is unmitigated, and recent state legislation mandating that grocery
stores provide bins for plastic bag recycling (AB 2449) is not expected to have
significant impact on reducing the use of plastic bags (and may not improve
recycling rates, given the difficult logistics and poor economics of recycling
plastic bags).
      (16)   The EPA estimates that disposal costs for single-use retail bags
in the state exceeds $51,000,000 annually.
      (17)   The nation of Ireland imposed a $.17 surcharge on carry-out
plastic bags which resulted in a 90% decrease in consumption of plastic bags.
      (18)   State law does not prohibit local ordinances from seeking to
remedy this problem by banning plastic bags outright in favor of re-usable
cloth bags or paper bags or adding a surcharge for paper-carry out bags.
      (19)   Alternatives to plastic bags are readily available and include re-
usable cloth bags, paper bags, and grocery stores could do more to provide for
sale and encourage their customers to use such bags, making plastic
unnecessary.
      (20)   State law does not prohibit the adoption, implementation, or
enforcement of any local ordinance, resolution, regulation or rule governing
curbside or drop off recycling programs operated by, or pursuant to a contract
with a city, county or other public agency, including any action relating to
fees for these programs.
      (21)   The town has a duty to protect the natural environment, the
economy, and the health of its citizens.
      (22)   The town has adopted town-wide goals of 80% landfill diversion by
2012 and zero waste by 2020.
      (23)   The expansive usage of plastic shopping bags and their typical
disposal creates an impediment to Fairfax's landfill diversion goals.
      (24)   Plastic shopping bags are difficult to recycle and currently
contaminate, or will contaminate, material that is processed through Fairfax's
recycling and anticipated composting programs.
      (25)   Plastic shopping bags create significant litter problems in
Fairfax's neighborhoods and also its streets, parks, creeks and open space
lands.
      (26)   It is the intent of the State Legislature, in enacting Cal. Public
Resources Code Division 30, Part 3, Chapter 5.1 (commencing with § 42250), to
encourage the use of reusable bags by consumers and retailers and to reduce the
consumption of single-use bags.
   (B)   Therefore, a need exists to adopt regulations to reduce the use of
plastic bags in Fairfax.

to be intrusive;
      (4)   Total duration of noise produced by noise source; and
      (5)   Date and time of noise measurement survey.
   (B)   Noise measurement procedure:
      (1)   Utilizing the A weighting scale of the sound level meter and the
“slow” meter response (use “fast” response for impulsive type sounds), the
noise level shall be measured at a position or positions at any point on the
complainant’s property line.
      (2)   In general, the microphone shall be located four to five feet above
the ground, ten feet or more from the nearest reflective surface, where
possible; however, in those cases where another elevation is deemed
appropriate, the latter shall be utilized. Calibration of the measurement
equipment, utilizing an acoustic calibrator, shall be performed immediately

   (A)   Maximum permissible sound levels by receiving land use.
      (1)   The noise standards for the various noise zones as presented in the
following table shall, unless otherwise specifically indicated, apply to all
such property within a designated zone.
      (2)   No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound
at any location within the incorporated town, or allow the creation of any
noise on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by the
person, which causes the noise level when measured at the complainant’s
property line to exceed the limits in the table below for more than seven and
one-half minutes in a 15- minute period. Those seven and one-half minutes need
not be continuous.
      (3)   If the measured ambient level differs from that permissible, the
allowable noise exposure standard shall be adjusted in five-decibel increments
in each category as appropriate to encompass or reflect the ambient noise
level.
      (4)   If the measurement location is on a boundary between two different
zones, the noise level limit applicable to the lower noise zone shall apply.
   (B)   Correction for character of sound.
      (1)   In the event the alleged offensive noise, as judged by the Chief of
Police or his or her designated representative, contains a steady, audible tone
such as a whine, screech or hum, or is a repetitive noise such as hammering or
riveting, or contains music or speech, the standard limits set forth in the
table below shall be reduced by five decibels.

therein, and a third copy shall be mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid,
to the person appearing upon the records of the Town Assessor as the owner of
the property, at his or her last known address as shown by the records.

the opinion of the engineer,
the structure will not significantly change the course of the creek in a manner
which creates a hydraulic impact on other property according to accepted
engineering standards.
   (B)   An application for a tree removal permit shall be made pursuant to
Chapter 12.44 of this code.
(Prior Code, § 8.24.120) (Ord. 496, passed - -1982; Am. Ord. 499, passed - -

treatment of exposed concrete and suitable landscaping of fill and excavation
made in the construction of the structures, including, but not limited to
redwood timbers.

continued flow of water and including conditions imposed by the adopted design
criteria. Any person dissatisfied with any action of the Building Inspector in

   Should the Building Inspector determine that the construction proposed does
not require any special skill or knowledge, and that the structure is of such a
small nature as to make expensive design impracticable, the Building Inspector
may waive the requirement that plans and specifications are to be prepared by a
duly licensed civil engineer, and may accept plans prepared by the applicant or
his or her agents.

      INCIDENTAL IRRIGATION RUNOFF.  Unintended amounts (volume) of runoff,
such as unintended, minimal over-spray from sprinklers that escapes the
landscaped area of intended use. Water leaving an intended use area is not
considered incidental if it is part of the facility design, if it is due to
excessive application, if it is due to intentional overflow or application, or
if it is due to negligence.
      LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID). A sustainable practice that benefits water
supply and contributes to water quality protection. LID uses site design and
stormwater management to maintain the site's pre-development runoff rates and
volumes. The goal of LID is to mimic a site's predevelopment hydrology by using
design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff
close to the source of rainfall.
      MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE (MEP). The minimum required performance
standards, BMPs, control techniques and systems, design and engineering
methods, and such other provisions as the Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator or the State determines appropriate for reducing pollutants in
stormwater. MEP is the cumulative effect of implementing, evaluating, and
making corresponding changes to a variety of technically appropriate and
economically feasible BMPs, ensuring that the most appropriate controls are
implemented in the most effective manner. This process of implementing,
evaluation, revising, or adding new BMPs is commonly referred to as the
iterative process.
      MCSTOPPP. The Marin County Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program.
      NPDES PERMIT. A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the State
Water Resources Control Board, or a California Regional Water Quality Control
Board pursuant to the Clean Water Act that authorizes discharges to waters of
the United States.

2015)
§ 8.32.020 DISCHARGE REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Discharge of pollutants. The discharge of non-stormwater discharges to
the town storm drain system is prohibited. All discharges of material other
than stormwater must be in compliance with an NPDES permit issued for the
discharge.
   (B)   Exceptions to discharge prohibition. The following discharges are
exempt from the prohibition set forth in division (A) of this section:
      (1)   Discharges regulated under another NPDES permit issued to the
discharger and administered by the State of California under authority of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is
in full compliance with all requirements of the permit and other applicable
laws or regulations.
      (2)   Discharges or flows from fire-fighting activities unless they are
identified as significant sources of pollutants to waters of the United States.
      (3)   Discharges from the following activities will not be considered a
source of pollutants to waters of the US when properly managed, provided any
pollutants in the discharges are identified and appropriate control measures to
minimize the impacts of such discharges are developed and implemented.
         (a)   Water line flushing;
         (b)   Individual residential car washing;
         (c)   Diverted stream flows;

conditions in division (B)(4) of this section are met.
      (4)   Incidental irrigation runoff is the unintended amounts of runoff
that leave the area of application such as minimal overspray. Water leaving the
intended area of application is not incidental if it is due to the design,
excessive application, or intentional overflow or application. Irrigation
systems must be designed to conserve water and prevent water leaving the area
of application. Property owners and persons responsible shall control
irrigation systems to prevent excessive irrigation runoff by implementing the
following BMPs:
         (a)   Detect and repair leaks from the irrigation system within 72
hours of discovering the leak;
         (b)   Properly design and aim sprinkler heads to only irrigate the
planned application area;
         (c)   Do not irrigate during precipitation events; and
         (d)    Where recycled water is used for irrigation, design and manage
holding ponds such that no discharge occurs unless it is the result of the 25
year-24 hour storm event. Any releases from holding ponds must be reported to
the Regional Water Board and the county within 24 hours of the discharge.
   (C)   Discharge in violation of permit.
      (1)   Any discharge that would result in or contribute to a violation of
the Phase II Stormwater Permit and any amendment, revision or reissuance
thereof, either separately considered or when combined, with other discharges,
is prohibited.
      (2)   Liability for any such discharge shall be the responsibility of the
person(s) so causing or responsible for the discharge and the persons shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the town in any administrative or judicial
enforcement action relating to the discharge.
   (D)   Illicit discharges and illicit connections.
      (1)   The establishment, use, maintenance or continuance of illicit
connections to the town storm drains or watercourse, and/or the commencement or
continuance of illicit discharges to the town storm drains or watercourse is
prohibited.

limited to ownership and use of parking lots, gasoline stations, industrial
facilities, commercial facilities, ground disturbing activities, and stores
fronting town streets.
      (1)   Littering.
         (a)   Except for pollutants lawfully disposed of by way of containers
or at a licensed dumping ground, no person shall throw, deposit, leave,
maintain, keep or permit to be thrown, deposited, placed, left or maintained,
any refuse, rubbish, garbage or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles
and accumulations, in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain, inlet,
catch basin, conduit or other drainage structures, business place or upon any
public or private lot of land or other premises in the town, so that the same
might be or become a pollutant discharged to water.
         (b)   The occupant or tenant, or in the absence of occupant or tenant,
the owner, lessee or proprietor of any premises in the Town of Fairfax in front
of which there is a paved sidewalk shall maintain the sidewalk free of dirt or
litter to the maximum extent practicable. Sweepings from the sidewalk shall not
be swept or otherwise made or allowed to go into the gutter or roadway, but
shall be disposed of in receptacles maintained on the real property as required
for the recycling or disposal of garbage.
      (2)   Standard for parking lots and similar structures. Persons owning or
operating a parking lot, gas station, area of pavement or similar structure
shall clean those structures as frequently and thoroughly as practicable in a
manner that does not result in discharge of pollutants to the town storm drain
system or watercourse.
      (3)   Construction-phase best management practices.
         (a)   Any person performing construction activities in the town shall
implement appropriate BMPs to prevent the discharge of construction wastes or
contaminants from construction materials, tools, and equipment from entering
the storm drain system or watercourse.
         (b)   The town has the authority to review designs and proposals for
construction activities to determine whether adequate BMPs will be installed,
implemented, and maintained during construction and after final stabilization.
         (c)   Construction-phase BMPs include erosion and sediment controls
and pollution prevention practices. Erosion control BMPs may include, but are
not limited to, scheduling and timing of grading activities, timely
revegetation of graded areas, the use of hydroseed and hydraulic mulches, and
installation of erosion control blankets. Sediment control may include properly
sized detention basins, dams, or filters to reduce entry of suspended sediment
into the storm drain system and watercourses, and installation of construction
entrances to prevent tracking of sediment onto adjacent streets. Pollution
prevention practices may include designated washout areas or facilities,
control of trash and recycled materials, tarping of materials stored on-site,
and proper location of and maintenance of temporary sanitary facilities. The
combination of BMPs used, and their execution in the field, must be customized
to the site using up-to-date standards and practices. The agency will provide
references to current guidance manuals and BMP information on request.
      (4)   Erosion and Sediment Control Plan requirements.
         (a)   When required by the Phase II Stormwater Permit or by the town,
a project shall have an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (ESCP) which
addresses erosion and sediment control and pollution prevention during the
construction phase as well as final stabilization control measures. The ESCP
and the specific control measures to be utilized shall be subject to the review
and approval of the town. The ESCP shall be implemented year round and shall be
revised to reflect changing conditions on the project site. The town shall
require modifications of an approved ESCP if during the course of construction
at a site unanticipated conditions occur or the plans prove inadequate for the
intended purpose. Revisions of the approved ESCP shall be submitted to the town
for review and approval. An Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (ESCP) shall be
required for any project:
            1.   Subject to a grading permit under
Chapter 12.20 Excavations Generally;
            2.   Subject to a building permit or other permit that has the
potential for significant erosion and/or significant non-stormwater discharges
of sediment and/or construction site waste;
            3.   As required by the town considering factors such as whether
the project involves hillside soil disturbance, rainy season construction,
construction near a creek or an intermittent or ephemeral drainageway, or any
other condition or construction site activity that could lead to a non-
stormwater discharge to a storm drain if not managed by effective
implementation of an ESCP.
         (b)   The ESCP shall be submitted for review and approval by the town.
The project applicant shall follow the most recent version of the MCSTOPPP
Construction Erosion and Sediment Control Plan Applicant Package. At a minimum,
the ESCP shall include:
            1.   Description of the proposed project and soil disturbing
activity;
            2.   Site specific construction-phase Best Management Practices
(BMPs);
            3.   Rationale for selecting the BMPs;
            4.   List of applicable outside agency permits associated with the
soil disturbing activity, such as: Construction General Permit (CGP); Clean
Water Act § 404 Permit; Clean Water Act § 401 Water Quality Certification;
Streambed/Lake Alteration Agreement (1600 Agreements).
         (c)   If the project requires coverage under the CGP issued by the
State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), Permit Registration Documents must
be filed with the SWRCB for said coverage and a copy of the Waste Discharge
Identification Number shall be submitted to the town prior to issuance of a
permit for construction. The applicant may submit the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) required by the General Construction Activity
Stormwater Permit in lieu of the ESCP provided it meets the requirements of the
ESCP.
         (d)   Financial security may be required to ensure that temporary
measures to control stormwater pollution are implemented and maintained during
construction and after construction for a period determined by the town.
Financial security shall consist of an irrevocable letter of credit, cash
deposit, or performance bond as determined by the town.
         (e)   Implementation of an approved ESCP shall be a condition of the
issuance of a building permit, a grading permit, or other permit issued by the
town for a project subject to this section. The ESCP shall be implemented year
round and must be updated to reflect changing conditions on the project site.
Any modifications to the ESCP shall be submitted to the town for review and
approval.
      (5)   Permanent stormwater controls for new development and
redevelopment. The town may require, as a condition of project approval,
permanent structural controls designed for the removal of sediment and other
pollutants and for control on the volume and rate of stormwater runoff from the
project's added or replaced impervious surfaces. These controls may include
limits on impervious area. The selection and design of such controls shall be
in general accordance with criteria established or recommended by federal,
state, and local agencies, and where required by the BASMAA Post Construction
Manual. Where physical and safety conditions allow, the preferred control
measure is to retain drainage ways above ground and in as natural a state as
possible or other biological methods such as bioretention areas. Where required
by the Phase II Stormwater Permit Provision E.12, or where required by the
nature and extent of a proposed project and where deemed appropriate by the
agency, every applicant shall develop, submit and implement a Stormwater
Control Plan (SOP) as described below:
         (a)   The SCP shall follow the appropriate SCP template, based on
project type, in the most recent version of the BASMAA Post Construction
Manual.
         (b)   The specific practices proposed in the SCP shall be subject to
the review and approval of the town and shall be in general accordance with the
BASMAA Post Construction Manual, and the Phase Il Stormwater Permit.
         (c)   The SCP is separate and distinct from the ESCP requirements
described in §
8.32.020(E)(4).
         (d)   All stormwater management facilities shall be designed in a
manner to minimize the need for maintenance and reduce the chances of failure.
Design guidelines are outlined in the BASMAA Post Construction Manual.
         (e)   Where required by the town, as a condition precedent to the
issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall submit a preliminary
Stormwater Facilities Operation and Maintenance Plan (O&M Plan). The approval
of the O&M Plan by the town is required prior to final inspection and approval
of building permit closure.
         (f)   All stormwater management facilities shall be maintained
according to the approved O&M Plan. The person(s) or organization(s)
responsible for maintenance shall be designated in the O&M Plan. The O&M Plan
shall require that stormwater management facilities be inspected by those
responsible for maintenance at least annually. The O&M Plan shall also describe
how the maintenance will be funded. Upon the failure of a responsible person to
maintain the stormwater management facilities in accordance with the O&M Plan,
the town may perform the maintenance and recover its costs from the responsible
person as provided in §
8.32.030.
         (g)   Where deemed appropriate by the town, the town shall have access
to stormwater management facilities for inspections, as provided in §
8.32.030, and through such means as may be appropriate, including, but not
limited to, legal agreements, recorded covenants or easements, shall be
provided by the property owner.
         (h)   All project proponents and their successors, or successors in
fee title, in control of project that is located within the town and that is
defined as a Regulated Project in Provision E.12.c. of the Phase Il Stormwater

the operations and maintenance of the stormwater management facilities until
such responsibility is legally transferred to another entity;
            3.   Written text in project deeds, or conditions, covenants and
restrictions for multi-unit residential projects that require the homeowners
association or, if there is no association, each individual owner to assume
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management
facilities until such responsibility is legally transferred to another entity;
or
            4.   Any other legally enforceable agreement or mechanism, such as
recordation in the property deed, that assigns the operation and maintenance of
the stormwater management facilities to the project owner(s) or the town.
         (i)   Financial security may be required to ensure that stormwater
management facilities operate and are maintained following construction for a
period which may be determined by the agency. Financial security shall consist
of an irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, or performance bond as
determined by the agency.

illicit discharges and/or discharge of non-stormwater to the storm drain
system, every person undertaking the activity or operation or owning or
operating the facility shall comply with the guidelines or requirements as may
be identified by the authorized enforcement official.
   (F)   Watercourse protection.
      (1)   Every person owning, occupying, leasing, renting or in control of
premises through which a watercourse passes, shall:
         (a)   Keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the
property reasonably free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other
obstacles which would and/or could pollute, contaminate or significantly retard
the flow of water through the watercourse;
         (b)   Maintain existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent
to a watercourse, so that the structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function or physical integrity of the watercourse; and
         (c)   Not remove healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually
necessary for the maintenance, nor remove the vegetation in a manner as to
increase the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion.
      (2)   No person shall commit or cause to be committed any of the
following acts, unless a written permit has first been obtained from the Town

§ 8.36.010 PURPOSE.
   The town derives much of its character and beauty from its large trees and
natural setting. Significant portions of the town are forested with redwood,
oak, bay, madrone, Douglas fir, pine and other native tree species. The
preservation of these trees enhances the town's natural scenic beauty and
enhances the quality of the community. In addition, these trees help prevent
the erosion of topsoil, protect against flood and landslides, reduce carbon
dioxide, counteract the pollutants in the air, create wildlife habitat,
maintain the climatic balance, and decrease wind velocities. Therefore, it is
necessary for the health and welfare of the citizens of the town to enact
regulations controlling removal and preservation of trees within the town.

Council, and shall be submitted to the Director, who will then submit it to the
Committee. The Director shall inform the applicant of the date of the Committee
hearing.
   (B)   At the time of submitting the application to the Director, the
applicant shall clearly mark each tree to be considered for removal with a
bright colored ribbon. Where applicable and feasible, the perimeter outline of
proposed buildings, and all underground utilities, drainage facilities, areas
to be graded and retaining walls, shall be staked on the building site. Notice

§ 8.36.060 TREE ADVISORY COMMITTEE HEARING.
   (A)   The Committee may require the applicant to submit his or her
application to a Qualified Arborist designated by the town for a report and
recommendation. The applicant shall bear all expenses in conjunction with this
report. If the Committee reasonably determines that the Qualified Arborist
report is not credible, the Committee may require that the applicant submit his
or her application and Qualified Arborist report, at the town's expense, for
peer review by an additional Qualified Arborist selected by the Committee. The
Committee may also request that the applicant provide computer generated
simulations of the potential impacts of the proposed tree removal or plantings.
   (B)   After reviewing the application and accompanying materials and
inspecting the premises, the Committee shall grant or deny the permit based
upon the following considerations:
      (1)   Whether the alteration or removal of the tree(s) is necessary to
protect the public health and safety and prevent damage to property. The
Committee may consider the condition of the tree(s) with respect to disease,
danger of structural failure, potential fire hazards, and proximity to existing
or proposed structures, and whether the alteration or removal of the tree(s)
will prevent or correct damage to property or infrastructure. The Committee
should also consider whether the alteration or removal of the tree(s) is
necessary in order to prevent the obstruction or interference with public
utility facilities, sanitary sewer facilities, storm drains, water supply
facilities, or watercourses.
      (2)   The character of the surrounding neighborhood and the effect of the
proposed tree alteration or removal upon aesthetics, privacy, shade, and
property values in the area. The Committee may consider whether the over-all
tree density and canopy cover is consistent with the existing character of the
town, or whether the tree has matured to such an extent that it is determined
to be out of scale with adjacent structures and utilities, or other landscape
features.
      (3)   Whether the tree is a heritage tree, specimen tree, undesirable
tree, or other species.
      (4)   Whether the proposed tree alteration or removal is necessary to
allow the owner to reasonably develop and use the subject property. The
Committee may consider whether reasonable revisions to a proposed project would
allow an owner to reasonably develop and use the subject property without
requiring removal or alteration of a healthy heritage tree or multiple trees.
Where the Committee determines that the tree alteration or removal is necessary
to allow reasonable development of the property, the approval of the tree
permit shall be conditioned on the issuance of all necessary approvals from the
Planning Commission and Town Council.
      (5)   The topography of the land and whether the tree alteration or
removal will have an adverse effect on erosion, soil retention, and the
diversion or increased flow of surface water. The Committee may consider
whether adequate provisions to avoid these impacts have been made.
      (6)   Whether the proposed tree alteration or removal would have a
detrimental effect on the health of surrounding trees, or whether the proposed
action would enhance the health of the subject tree or adjacent trees.
      (7)   Where tree alteration is proposed, whether the alteration would
harm or diminish the vigor of the tree.
   (C)   The Director shall grant or deny the permit based on the findings and
direction of the Committee.
   (D)   Reasonable conditions of approval may be attached to any tree removal
permit including, but not limited to, the replacement of removed trees. In
general, removed trees shall be replaced at a minimum ratio of 1:1. The Tree
Committee shall have the authority to specify the ratio, where necessary after
considering of any fire hazard risk. The site or sites for replacement may be
specified by the Committee. Replacement trees shall be of a reasonable size as
determined by the Committee based on the recommendation. Drought tolerant,
native species that are not susceptible to Sudden Oak Death Syndrome shall be
preferred as replacement trees. Security and maintenance measures may be
required in order to ensure the successful establishment of replacement trees.
Notwithstanding this section, the Committee may authorize the planting of a
lesser number of trees of a greater size where this would further the purposes
of this chapter.
   (E)   Approval of a tree permit by the Committee shall not constitute
approval of project or the issuance of a permit for building or grading.
(Ord. 743, passed 7-1-2009)
§ 8.36.070 QUALIFIED ARBORIST REPORT; CONTENTS.
   A report by a Qualified Arborist, as described in §
8.36.060, shall:
   (A)   Describe the tree(s) to be altered or removed, including species,

   (B)   Clearly describe and identify any disease or structural defect
affecting the tree and any threat or hazard to people or property presented by
the tree(s), including, where applicable, a clear description of the threatened
structure and the condition(s) of the tree(s) that give rise to the threat.
   (C)   Discuss what measures could be considered to preserve the tree(s) or
mitigate the risk to property and the relative feasibility of such
alternatives.
   (D)   Include a completed Tree Hazard Evaluation Form, as developed by the
ISA (International Society of Architects).
(Ord. 743, passed 7-1-2009)
§ 8.36.080 CONSTRUCTION; TREE PROTECTION PLAN.
   (A)   In order to protect trees during construction of a project, and to
maximize chances for their subsequent survival, a Tree Protection Plan
(hereafter TPP) shall be required for all applications for a tentative map, use
permit, variance, design review, encroachment permit, or building permit where
proposed construction would be located near any tree for which a tree
alteration or removal permit would be required by the provisions of this
chapter, whether on the subject property or an adjoining property.
   (B)   The TPP shall be prepared by a Qualified Arborist. The TPP shall
include:
      (1)   The size, species, state of health, structural condition, crown
diameter, and accurate trunk location and architectural structure of all trees
within, and directly adjacent to, the proposed development are, including any
area where trenching is proposed, whether on the subject property or on
adjoining property; and
      (2)   A description of all proposed measures to ensure the survival of
remaining trees throughout the entire development process.
(Ord. 743, passed 7-1-2009)
§ 8.36.090 SUBDIVISIONS.
   A subdivider or an applicant for any development permit under Title 17 need
not obtain a separate tree removal permit to alter or remove a tree designated
as "To Be Removed" on an approved subdivision map (tentative map or parcel map)
or other development plan, provided that the tree alteration or removal and a
Tree Protection Plan have been reviewed and approved by the decision-making
body for the subdivision map or development plan based on the criteria in §
8.36.060(B) and §
8.36.080 of this chapter. The subdivision map or other development plans
required by this code shall clearly designate type, size, and location of any
tree upon the property that is to be altered or removed. The decision-making
body may also require the applicant to submit a report by a Qualified Arborist
as provided in §
8.36.060(A).

ARTICLE I: SMOKING REGULATIONS
§ 8.44.010 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The Town Council does find that:
   (A)   Tobacco use causes death and disease and continues to be an urgent
public health challenge, as evidenced by the following:
      (1)   Tobacco-related illness is the leading cause of preventable death
in the United States, accounting for about 443,000 deaths each year; and
scientific studies have concluded that tobacco use can
cause chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke, in addition to
cancer of the lungs, larynx, esophagus, and mouth; and
      (2)    Some of the most common types of cancers including stomach, liver,
uterine cervix, and kidney are related to tobacco use; and
   (B)   Secondhand smoke has been repeatedly identified as a health hazard, as
evidenced by the following:
      (1)   The U.S. Surgeon General concluded that there is no risk-free level
of exposure to secondhand smoke; and
      (2)   The California Air Resources Board placed secondhand smoke in the
same category as the most toxic automotive and industrial air pollutants by
categorizing it as a toxic air contaminant for which there is no safe level of
exposure; and
      (3)   The California Environmental Protection Agency included secondhand
smoke on the Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to the State of California
to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm; and
      (C)   Exposure to secondhand smoke causes death and disease, as evidenced
by the following:
      (1)   Secondhand smoke is responsible for as many as 73,000 deaths among
nonsmokers each year in the United States; and
      (2)   Exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of coronary heart
disease by approximately 30 percent; and
      (3)   Secondhand smoke exposure causes lower respiratory tract
infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis in as many as 300,000 children in
the United States under the age of 18 months each year; and exacerbates
childhood asthma; and
   (D)   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted laboratory analysis of
electronic cigarette samples and found they contained carcinogens and toxic
chemicals to which users and bystanders could potentially be exposed; and
   (E)   Tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke impose great social and
economic costs, as evidenced by the following:
      (1)   The total annual economic burden of smoking in the United States is
$193,000,000,000; and
      (2)   From 2001 through 2004, the average annual health care expenditures
attributable to smoking were approximately $96,000,000,000; and
      (3)   The medical and other costs to nonsmokers due to exposure to
secondhand smoke were estimated at over $10,000,000,000 per year in the United
States in 2005; and
      (4)   The total annual cost of smoking in California was estimated at
$475 per resident or $3,331 per smoker per year, for a total of nearly
$15,800,000,000 in smoking-related costs in 1999 alone; and
      (5)   California’s Tobacco Control Program saved the state and its
residents $86,000,000,000 in health care expenditures between the year of its
inception, 1989, and 2004, with savings growing yearly; and
   (F)   Exposure to secondhand smoke anywhere has negative health impacts, and
exposure to secondhand smoke does occur at significant levels outdoors, as
evidenced by the following:
      (1)   Levels of secondhand smoke exposure outdoors can reach levels
attained indoors depending on direction and amount of wind and number and
proximity of smokers; and
      (2)   Irritation from secondhand smoke begins at levels as low as four
micrograms per cubic meter, and in some outdoor situations this level can be
found as far away as 13 feet from the burning cigarette; and
      (3)   To be completely free from exposure to secondhand smoke in outdoor
places, a person may have to move nearly 25 feet away from the source of the
smoke, about the width of a two-lane road; and
   (G)   Thirdhand smoke harms indoor air quality and is a recognized public
health concern, as evidenced by the following:
      (1)   Thirdhand smoke is residual tobacco smoke contamination after a
cigarette has been extinguished and takes the form of particulate matter that
is deposited in a layer onto every indoor surface; in loose household dust; and
as volatile organic compounds that “off gas” into the air over days, weeks and
months; and
      (2)   Desorption of thirdhand smoke from indoor surfaces to air is
recognized as a source of tobacco exposure;
      (3)   A majority of adults in the United States agreed with the statement
that breathing in air in a room today where people smoked yesterday can harm
the health of children; and
   (H)   Thirdhand smoke exposure has negative health impacts, as evidenced by
the following:
      (1)   Tobacco smoke constituents, even at low levels, have been proved
toxic; and
      (2)   Residual nicotine from tobacco smoke absorbed to indoor surfaces
reacts with ambient nitrous acid, a common indoor air pollutant, to form
carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines; and
      (3)   High levels of nicotine on indoor surfaces represents a health
hazard through dermal exposure, dust inhalation, and ingestion; and
   (I)   Smoking is the primary cause of fire-related injuries and deaths in
the home, as evidenced by the following:
      (1)   Cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other smoking materials are the
leading cause of fire deaths in the United States, causing an estimated 142,900
smoking-related fires, 780 deaths, 1,600 injuries, and $606,000,000 in direct
property damage in 2006; and
      (2)   One in four fatalities from home fires caused by smoking is NOT the
smoker whose cigarette started the fire, and 25 percent of those deaths were of
neighbors or friends of the smoker; and
      (3)   Smoking in a residence where long-term oxygen therapy takes place
is very dangerous as oxygen is a fire accelerant, and 27 percent of fatalities
due to smoking during long-term oxygen therapy occurred in multifamily
dwellings; and
      (4)   The United States Fire Administration recommends that people smoke
outdoors; and
   (J)   Nonsmokers who live in multi-unit dwellings can be exposed to
neighbors' secondhand smoke, as evidenced by the following:
      (1)   Secondhand smoke can seep under doorways and through wall cracks;
and persons living in apartments near smokers can be exposed to elevated
pollution levels for 24 hours a day, and at times, the particulate matter
exposure can exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 24-Hour Health
Based Standard; and
      (2)   The Surgeon General has concluded that eliminating smoking in
indoor spaces is the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke
exposure and that separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and
ventilating buildings cannot completely prevent secondhand smoke exposure; and
      (3)   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the World
Health Organization (WHO) have found that there is no risk-free level of
secondhand smoke, and even brief exposure can cause immediate harm.
Establishing a 100 percent smoke free environment is the only effective way to
fully protect those who do not smoke from secondhand smoke.
   (K)   Most Californians do not smoke and a majority favors limitations on
smoking in multi-unit residences, as evidenced by the following:
      (1)   Sixty-nine percent of Californians surveyed favor limiting smoking
in outdoor common areas of apartment buildings and 78 percent support laws that
create nonsmoking units; and
      (2)   Sixty-two percent of California renters feel that there is a need
for laws to limit smoking in apartments; and
   (L)   A local ordinance that authorizes residential rental agreements to
include a prohibition on smoking of tobacco products within rental units is
expressly permitted by California law; and
   (M)   Creating smoke free areas helps protect the health of the 86.7 percent
of Californians who are nonsmokers; and
   (N)   State law prohibits smoking within 25 feet of playgrounds and tot lots
and expressly authorizes local communities to enact additional restrictions;
and state law prohibits smoking within 20 feet of entryways and operable
windows of government buildings; and
   (O)   Cigarette butts are a major and persistent source of litter, as
evidenced by the following:
      (1)   It is estimated that over 2,000,000,000 billion cigarette butts are
discarded every day worldwide, and that Americans alone discard more than
175,000,000 pounds of cigarette butts every year; and
      (2)   Cigarette butts are often cast onto sidewalks and streets, and
frequently end up in storm drains that flow into streams, rivers, bays, lagoons
and ultimately the ocean; and
      (3)   Cigarette filters, made of plastic cellulose acetate, take
approximately 15 years to decompose; and
   (P)   There is no Constitutional right to smoke.
   (Q)   Electronic smoking devices, or "e-cigarettes," have become
increasingly popular in recent years, as evidenced by the following:
      (1)   Between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of all youth in grades six to
12 who had tried electronic smoking devices doubled;
      (2)   Six point eight percent (6.8%) of all youth between sixth and
twelfth grade report trying electronic smoking devices;
      (3)   Ten percent (10%) of high school students have tried electronic
smoking devices;
      (4)   Nine point three percent (9.3%) of youth who have used electronic
smoking devices have never smoked conventional cigarettes;
      (5)   Between 2010 and 2011, rates of both awareness and use of
unregulated electronic smoking devices by adults also increased significantly;
      (6)   Findings from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey show that
current e-cigarette use (use on at least one day in the past 30 days) among
high school students increased from 4.5% in 2013 to 13.4% in 2014, rising from
approximately 660,000 to 2,000,000 students; and
      (7)   Among middle school students, current e-cigarette use more than
tripled from 1.1% in 2013 to 3.9% in 2014, an increase from approximately
120,000 to 450,000 students.
   (R)   The State of California's Tobacco Education and Research Oversight
Committee (TEROC) "opposes the use of e-cigarettes in all areas where other
tobacco products are banned."
   (S)   A study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health
suggests that electronic smoking devices "may have the capacity to 're-
normalize' tobacco use in a demographic that has had significant
denormalization of tobacco use previously."
   (T)   Electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products
in shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor similar in
appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco
products.
   (U)   The use of electronic smoking devices in smoke free locations
threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the
progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not
permitted in public places and places of employment.
   (V)   Cal. Health & Safety Code § 11362.3 provides that no person may smoke
marijuana/ cannabis or marijuana/cannabis products in a location where smoking
tobacco is prohibited. Therefore the smoking regulations herein are intended to
apply equally to smoking of cannabis and cannabis products to the fullest
extent permitted by law.
   (W)   Flavored tobacco products promote youth initiation of tobacco use and
cause young occasional smokers to become daily smokers by reducing or masking
the natural harshness and taste of tobacco smoke and thereby increasing the
appeal of tobacco products.

§ 8.44.260 LICENSE CONVEYS A LIMITED, CONDITIONAL PRIVILEGE.
   Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and
maintaining a tobacco retailer's license any status or right other than the

provision of this Code including, without limitation, the zoning ordinance and
building codes, or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place

for tobacco purchases or possession against a minor person who otherwise might
be in violation of such law because of the person's age (hereinafter "youth

the licensee's agents or employees, has violated any of the requirements,
conditions, or prohibitions of this article or has pleaded guilty, "no contest"
or its equivalent, or admitted to a violation of any law designated in §

of such great concern to the Town Council that in order to protect the health,
safety and welfare of Fairfax residents this chapter is being adopted. The Town
Council is formalizing Fairfax’s official policy of not using pesticides on

parcels and public rights of way including both aerial spraying and ground
applications; and, requiring public notice entitled “neighbor notification”
prior to pesticide use on private property.
   (B)   Residents of Fairfax have a right to know when pesticides are being
used in their neighborhood on private property in order to allow time to take
precautions to protect themselves, their family, pets and property from the
hazards of pesticide exposure.
   (C)   (1)   The headwaters for Corte Madera Creek are the Fairfax and San
Anselmo (Cascade) Creeks which traverse the town limits.

majority vote of the full Town Council with a mandatory finding that the
health, safety and welfare of the community is so threatened that an emergency

§ 8.56.010 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   In enacting this chapter the Town Council makes the following findings and
articulates the following purposes for the promulgation of the living wage
regulations set forth herein:
   (A)   The health and welfare of all Fairfax residents is benefitted and
advances when Fairfax workers are paid a living wage;
   (B)   The town awards contracts to private sector and non profit employers
to provide services to the town in accordance with those contracts;
   (C)   Many workers in Fairfax and their families live at or below the
poverty line; (The payment of inadequate wages to those workers tends to
negatively affect the quality of services provided to the town and its
residents by fostering high turnover and instability in the workplace.)
   (D)   The payment of a living wage will increase the ability of low wage
workers to attain sustenance, decrease the amount of poverty and reduce the
amount of taxpayer funded services provided in the Town of Fairfax;
   (E)   Some employers who provide contract services to the Town do not
provide health insurance benefits to their employees; and (This factor
negatively affects worker performance and the quality of services delivered to
the town and its residents, results in unwarranted employee absenteeism and
negatively impacts local and state health programs. These problems can be
favorably impacted if employers provide reasonable health insurance benefits to
their employees.)
   (F)   Living wage jobs will decrease poverty, increase consumer income and
invigorate downtown businesses.
(Ord. 691, passed 8-6-2002)
§ 8.56.020 LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Covered employees shall be paid a living wage.
   (B)   The “living wage” to be paid to employees pursuant to the requirements
of this chapter shall be a minimum hourly wage of $13 with employer sponsored
benefits or $14.75 without employer sponsored benefits, until adjusted by

CHAPTER 8.60: RECYCLING AREAS REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Section
   
8.60.010   Purpose
   
8.60.020   Definitions
   
8.60.030   General requirements
   
8.60.040   Guidelines for all development projects
   
8.60.050   Additional guidelines for single-tenant development projects

8.60.080   Declaration of severability
§ 8.60.010 PURPOSE.
   In order to promote sustainability through source reduction, recycling, and
composting activities, the Town of Fairfax proposes to adopt this recycling
space allocation chapter.
   Fairfax encourages the participation of the residential, commercial,
industrial, and public sectors in recycling of solid waste.
   The lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials
that are compatible with surrounding land uses is a significant impediment to
diverting solid waste and constitutes a need for Fairfax to address access to
solid waste for source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. This
chapter has been developed to meet that need.
(Ord. 717, passed 9-6-2006)
§ 8.60.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. Any of the following:
      (1)   A project for which a building permit is required for a commercial,
industrial, or institutional building, or residential building having five or
more living units, where solid waste is collected and loaded and any
residential project where solid waste is collected and loaded in a location
serving five or more living units.
      (2)   Any new public facility where solid waste is collected and loaded
and any improvements for areas of a public facility used for collecting and
loading solid waste.
      (3)   The definition of DEVELOPMENT PROJECT only includes subdivisions or
tracts of single-family detached homes if, within such subdivisions or tract,
there is an area where solid waste is collected and loaded in a location which
serves five or more living units. In such instances, recycling areas as
specified in this chapter are only required to serve the needs of the living
units which utilize the solid waste collection and loading area.
   IMPROVEMENT.  An improvement adds to the value of a facility, prolongs its
useful life, or adapts it to new uses. Improvements should be distinguished
from repairs. Repairs keep facilities in good operating condition, do not
materially add to the value of the facility, and do not substantially extend
the life of the facility.
   PUBLIC FACILITY. The definition of public facility includes, but is not
limited to buildings, structures and outdoor recreation areas owned by a local
agency.
   RECYCLING AREA. Space allocated for collecting and loading of recyclable
materials. Such areas shall have the ability to accommodate receptacles for
recyclable materials. Recycling areas shall be accessible and convenient for

building permits for multiple alterations which are subsequently performed that
collectively add 30 percent or more to the existing floor area of that portion
of the development project which said tenant leases shall provide adequate,
accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable
materials. Such recycling areas shall, at a minimum, be sufficient in capacity,
number, and distribution to serve that portion of the development project which

CHAPTER 8.68: SMARTMETERS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT
Section
   
8.68.010   Statement of intent
   
8.68.020   Prohibition on installation of SmartMeters
§ 8.68.010 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   (A)   On August 4, 2010, the Town Council adopted Ordinance No. 752, an
urgency ordinance temporarily prohibiting the installation of any so-called
“SmartMeter” in or on any home, apartment, condominium or business in the town,
as well as the installation of equipment related to SmartMeters in, on, under,
or above any public street or public right-of-way in the town;
   (B)   Over the past three years, the Council, town staff and members of the
public have participated in extensive meetings with PG&E representatives, as
well as in legislative and regulatory hearings on SmartMeters, but there remain
significant questions about the security, privacy, safety, accuracy and health
effects, along with proposals for mitigating them or permitting consumer
alternatives to SmartMeters;
   (C)   In particular, PG&E’s Opt Out plan will not protect the privacy,
health and economic interests that were raised by numerous town residents in
their public comments, because the plan (as set forth in CPUC Application A 11-
03-014) requires a substantial upfront deposit and ongoing monthly fees, which
fees are unreasonable and do not reflect any savings garnered by maintaining
current analog meters and avoiding the acquisition and installation costs
incurred by replacement with SmartMeters;
   (D)   In addition, PG&E’s fee proposal also effectively discriminates
against those ratepayers who elect to opt out for health or safety reasons,
which is in violation of the prohibition on prejudicial rates in Cal. Public
Utilities Code § 453(b);
   (E)   Finally, the application does not address whether PG&E will honor the
ordinances of the numerous jurisdictions who have passed SmartMeter moratoriums
to protect and preserve the health and safety of their residents under their
constitutionally delegated power to do so;
   (F)   The status of PG&E’s Opt Out plan is currently under review by the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and unless the town acts to
protect and preserve the rights of its residents during the pendency of those
proceedings, the CPUC review process will effectively be rendered moot.
   (G)   As a result of these deficiencies and uncertainties, the Town Council
has determined that the prohibition on the installation of SmartMeters and
related equipment is necessary and proper to allow further regulatory and
legislative activities to proceed for three years unless sooner terminated if
the Town Council determines that the privacy, safety, accuracy and health
effects of SmartMeters have been adequately addressed.
   (H)   The Town Council has determined that the prohibition on the
installation of SmartMeters and related equipment for an additional three years
is necessary and proper to allow further legal, regulatory and legislative
activities to proceed.
   (I)   The Town Council has determined that the prohibition on the
installation of SmartMeters and related equipment is necessary and proper to
allow further regulatory and legislative activities to proceed until the Town
Council determines that the privacy, safety, accuracy and health effects of
SmartMeters have been adequately addressed at which time the Town Council will
consider action to repeal this chapter.

§ 8.68.020 PROHIBITION ON INSTALLATION OF SMARTMETERS.
   (A)   The town hereby prohibits the installation of SmartMeters or related
equipment. No SmartMeter may be installed in or on any home, apartment,
condominium or business in the town, and no equipment related to SmartMeters
may be installed in, on, under, or above any public street or public right- of-
way.
   (B)   Violations of this chapter may be charged as infractions or
misdemeanors as set forth in §
1.08.010 of this code or as administrative citations as set forth in
Chapter 1.10 of this code, in the discretion of the town. In addition,
violations shall be deemed public nuisances, with enforcement by injunction or
any other remedy authorized by law.
   (C)   The Town Manager is hereby authorized to direct all town departments,
including the Town Attorney, to facilitate compliance with the purpose and
intent of this chapter using the enforcement powers described in the preceding
paragraph.

to promulgate regulations and take any and all other actions reasonable and
necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter, including but not limited
to, entering the premises of any food provider during regular business hours to
verify compliance, and by the issuance of administrative citations. The
remedies and penalties provided by this chapter are cumulative and in addition
to any other remedies available at law or in equity.
   (A)   Administrative citations. Administrative citations may be issued for
violations of this chapter at the discretion of the Director. The issuance of
an administrative citation under this chapter shall not supersede or limit the
remedies provided elsewhere in this Code or California law, including other
administrative citation remedies. Issuance of an administrative citation may be
exercised in place of, but shall not be considered a waiver of, the use of any
other available enforcement remedy.
   (B)   Process and service of citation.
      (1)   Prior to issuance of citation penalty, the county shall issue a
violation warning letter to the facility operator and provide the facility
operator 30 days to correct the violation(s).
      (2)   The violation warning letter and/or citation shall be mailed to the
food facility operator named in the facility's permit.
      (3)   The failure of any interested person to receive the violation
warning letter and/or citation shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings.
   (C)   Administrative citation penalty schedule. Following the violation
warning letter described in division (B)(1) above and 30-day cure period, if
the violations remains, the county may issue the following administrative
penalties:
      (1)   A fine not exceeding $100 for the first violation;
      (2)   A fine not exceeding $200 for a second violation of the same Code
provision within one year; and
      (3)   A fine not exceeding $500 for each additional violation in excess
of two, of the same Code provision within one year.
   (D)   Response to citation penalty. Following receipt of citation penalty,
food facility operator shall have 30 days to pay the fine as indicated on the
citation, or to request a waiver of payment of the penalty due to unique undue
hardship. This waiver may be granted by the Director upon demonstration by a
food facility operator to the satisfaction of the Director that strict
application of the requirements would cause undue hardship. An "undue hardship"
includes but is not limited to the following: (1) a situation unique to the
food facility where a suitable alternative that conforms with the requirements
of this chapter does not exist for a specific application; and (2) imposing the
provisions of this chapter would cause significant economic hardship.
"Significant economic hardship" may be based on, but not limited to,
demonstrating that suitable foodware or foodware accessories made of compliant
compostable natural fiber is not available at a commercially reasonable price
and the additional cost associated with providing the compliant foodware or
foodware is particularly burdensome to the food facility based on the type of
operation(s) affected, the overall size of the business/operation, the number,
type and location of its facilities, the impact on the overall financial
resources of the food facility, and other factors. Reasonable added cost for a
suitable item as compared to a similar item that the food facility can no
longer use shall not by itself constitute adequate grounds to support an
exemption for such item. In determining whether a significant economic hardship
has been established, the Director or designee shall consider the following
information: ability of the food facility to recover the additional expense by
increasing its prices; the availability of tax credits and deductions; outside
funding; and other options.
   (E)   Nonpayment of citation for more than one year deemed nuisance.
Nonpayment of any assessed violation for longer than one year shall constitute
a nuisance and be subject to the nuisance abatement procedures in Marin County
Code Chapter 1.05, including payment of civil penalties of up to $2,500 per
violation per day and enforcement and other abatement costs incurred by the
County.

CHAPTER 9.16: MISCELLANEOUS POLICIES REGARDING MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA
Section
   
9.16.010   Purpose
   
9.16.020   Definitions
   
9.16.030   Findings
§ 9.16.010 PURPOSE.
   The purposes of the ordinance codified in this chapter are:
   (A)   To express the compassion of the people of the Town of Fairfax for
those who are ill in our community and whose sufferings would be alleviated by
the use of medical marijuana;
   (B)   To express the strong support of the people of the Town of Fairfax for
the restoration of Cannabis/marijuana medical preparations to the list of
available medicines which can be prescribed by licensed physicians; and
   (C)   To direct Town of Fairfax officials to take whatever actions may be
within their power to support the availability of Cannabis/marijuana for
medical use.
(Prior Code, § 9.14.010) (Ord. 627, passed - -1993)
§ 9.16.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CANNABIS/MARIJUANA MEDICAL PREPARATIONS. All products made from cannabis or
marijuana, in any form intended or used for human consumption, for the
treatment of any disease; the relief of pain; or as an adjunct to any medical
procedure for the treatment of cancer, glaucoma, or HIV/AIDS; or for any other
medical or healing purpose defined within the bounds of the patient/doctor
relationship.
(Prior Code, § 9.14.020) (Ord. 627, passed - -1993)
§ 9.16.030 FINDINGS.
   The Fairfax Town Council makes the following observations:
   (A)   Safe and effective medicine. Scientific and medical studies by the
National Academy of Science have shown Cannabis/marijuana to be a safe and
effective medicine with very low toxicity compared to most prescription drugs.
It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of glaucoma; clinically
diagnosed depression; epilepsy; muscle spasticity; arthritis; and the nausea,
vomiting and appetite loss associated with chemotherapies.
   (B)   Doctors and patients need the Cannabis/marijuana option. Studies show
that one- third of all cancer patients discontinue potentially life-saving
chemotherapy due to the severe and debilitating side effects. The same is true
for many HIV/AIDS patients receiving AZT or other similar therapies.
   (C)   United Nations approves prescription marijuana. In May of 1991, the
United Nations Narcotic Control Board voted overwhelmingly to reclassify
Cannabis/marijuana, placing it back on Schedule 2, and making it available by
prescription. The United States Representative to this Board voted in favor of
rescheduling.
   (D)   Federal court orders prescription marijuana. Despite a federal court
order recognizing the “clearly established medical value” of Cannabis/
marijuana, and mandating that it be reclassified to Schedule 2 and available by
prescription, the federal government continues to deny access to this safe and
effective medicine.
(Prior Code, § 9.14.030) (Ord. 627, passed - -1993)
CHAPTER 9.20: SPECIAL POLICE RESPONSE
Section
   
9.20.010   Liability for subsequent police responses
§ 9.20.010 LIABILITY FOR SUBSEQUENT POLICE RESPONSES.
   (A)   When there exists at any location in the town any activity that a
police officer at the scene determines creates a threat to the peace, health,
safety or general welfare of any member of the public or constitutes an
obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life or property of any other person, the police shall
give notice to the person(s) described in division (C) below that the
activities must immediately cease. The persons will be informed that if the
continued activity results in a subsequent response by police within the next
48 hours that the person(s) will be responsible for all costs for any such
subsequent response or responses.
   (B)   This chapter shall only apply to activities for which a citation may
be issued or an arrest made for a violation of a town ordinance or state
statute.
   (C)   For purposes of this chapter, any notice given shall be to any person
engaged in or who is in control of the prohibited activity or who owns or
otherwise is responsible for the property where the activity is occurring.
   (D)   Any such person described in division (C) below and the parent or
guardian of any such person who is a minor, shall be held jointly and severally
liable for payment of the costs resulting from the subsequent response or
responses, except that the maximum liability shall not exceed $1,000.
   (E)   The costs for subsequent responses shall be calculated as the total of
all costs incurred by the town in connection with each response including, but
not limited to the costs of personnel time, applicable administrative overhead
costs, costs for repair of any damage caused to town property and costs related
to any injuries to town personnel. The remedies herein set forth are non-
exclusive and are in addition to any and all other remedies available to the
town as provided by law.
   (F)   The Police Department shall submit documentation of all expenses for
responses covered by this chapter to the Finance Officer who shall establish
appropriate accounting and billing procedures to collect the fees.

   The purposes of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect the public health, safety and general welfare;
   (B)   To promote the reduction of underage drinking and use of controlled
substances by imposing administrative fines on persons responsible for loud or
unruly gatherings where alcohol and/or controlled substances are consumed by,
served to or in the possession of underage persons; and
   (C)   To facilitate the enforcement of laws prohibiting the service to,
consumption of, or possession of alcoholic beverages, marijuana/cannabis and/or
controlled substances by underage persons.
(Ord. 725, passed 11-7-2007; Am. Ord. 802, passed 8-3-2016; Am. Ord. 815,
passed 1-16-2018)
§ 9.28.020 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The Town Council finds as follows:
   (A)   The town, pursuant to the powers delegated to it by the California
Constitution, has the authority to enact laws that promote the public health,
safety and general welfare of its residents;
   (B)   The occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings on private property where
alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or
in the possession of underage persons is harmful to the underage persons
themselves and is a threat to the public health, safety, or quiet enjoyment of
residential property and the general welfare;
   (C)   The town, through the Police Department, has made numerous and
substantial efforts to enforce underage drinking and controlled substance laws;
yet, despite these efforts, alcohol and controlled substance use by youth
remains a serious problem in the town, contributing significantly to the
incidence of adolescent crime, addiction, sexual assault, truancy, driving
under the influence, and motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol and/or
controlled substances and causing injury and/or death;
   (D)   Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages and/or controlled
substances at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential
and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or
should know of the service to, possession by, and/or consumption of alcohol
and/or controlled substances by underage persons. The town wishes to prevent
occurrences wherein persons responsible for loud or unruly gatherings on
private property over which they have possession or control have failed to
ensure that alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are not served to,
consumed by or possessed by underage persons at these gatherings;
   (E)   The town further wishes to encourage residents to prevent the
occurrence or recurrence of loud or unruly gatherings, including those where
alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by or
possessed by underage persons, on private property, which seriously disrupt
neighboring residents’ quiet enjoyment of their property;
   (F)   Control of loud or unruly gatherings on private property where
alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or
in the possession of underage persons is necessary when such activity is
determined to be a threat to the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of
the public;
   (G)   The occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings on party buses or
limousines where alcoholic beverages, controlled substances and/or marijuana
are served to, ingested by or in the possession of underage persons is harmful
to the underage persons themselves and is a threat to the public health,
safety, or quiet enjoyment of the streets and highways as well as other areas
where a party bus or limousines drives, parks or temporarily stops;
   (H)   Persons held responsible for abetting or allowing loud or unruly
gatherings where alcohol and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed
by, or in the possession of underage persons will be more likely to properly
supervise or to stop such conduct at gatherings held on property in their
possession or under their control;
   (I)   Problems associated with loud or unruly gatherings at which alcoholic
beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the
possession of underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless the
town has the legal authority to issue an administrative citation for an
administrative fine;
   (J)   The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety,
quiet enjoyment of residential property, and general welfare, rather than to
punish;
   (K)   California Business and Professions Code § 25658 makes it unlawful for
a person under the age of 21 years to purchase or attempt to purchase, or
consume alcoholic beverages and makes it unlawful for any person to sell any
alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years;
   (L)   According to local, state and federal surveys, alcohol is
overwhelmingly and consistently the most widely used drug at all adolescent age
levels. A child who begins alcohol use prior to age 15 is four times as likely
to experience alcohol dependence than one who refrains from alcohol use until
age 20 or older;
   (M)   California Health and Safety Code §§ 11350 and 11377 make it unlawful
for any person to possess enumerated controlled substance without a written
prescription, with limited exceptions;
   (N)   Subject to certain exceptions authorized by law, California Health and
Safety Code § 11357 makes it unlawful for persons under the age of 21 to
possess marijuana/cannabis and marijuana/cannabis products;
   (O)   According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse,
nine out of 10 people with addiction began smoking, drinking or using other
drugs before they turned 18; and
   (P)   Subsections (A) through (J) are equally valid to the service of,
ingestion of or possession of marijuana/cannabis by underage persons. It is the
finding of the Town Council that the addition of marijuana/cannabis to the
prohibition outlined in §
9.28.050 is a reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of the youth and other residents of the town.
   (Q)   This Town Council therefore determines that this chapter is a
reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of the youth and other residents of the town.

   LOUD OR UNRULY GATHERING. A party or gathering of two or more persons at a

edibles containing marijuana or concentrated marijuana and any other product of
marijuana. For purposes of this chapter, the term MARIJUANA may be used
interchangeably with the term cannabis. Such term does not include medicinal
marijuana possessed with a recommendation for medical marijuana from an
approved provider, or a State of California medical marijuana ID card.
   MINOR. Any person less than 21 years of age.
   PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVENT. Includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   The person who owns, rents, leases or otherwise has control of the
premises where the gathering occurs;

the life, health, safety, and welfare of all people in the town and finds that
certain public lands within the geographical boundaries of the town pose
significant health, safety and welfare hazards to the people who make shelter

some of these public lands are environmentally sensitive and may be
significantly damaged by unregulated human activity. The Town Council is
committed to protecting the rights of individuals related to their personal
property and to treating such property with respect and consideration. It is
the purpose of this chapter to set standards for the preservation and
protection of human life, health, safety and welfare, to further the
preservation and protection of sensitive public lands to prevent destruction of

an encampment or at a location where a person is engaged in unlawful camping,
provided such removal is in compliance with the following procedures:
   (A)   Written notice required prior to abatement.
      (1)   A written notice of clean-up, in English and Spanish, will be
posted on each tent or structure and in any other distinct areas of the
encampment providing notice of the date of clean-up and giving a minimum of 72
hours for persons to remove their personal property. The written notice shall
also include the following statement, which may be updated by the Town Manager
to provide accurate and current information:
         “You must remove your belongings from this site within 72 hours. You
should not leave behind any belongings you want to keep. All belongings left
behind will be removed by the town. The town will post an impound notice, in
English and Spanish, if belongings are stored during the cleanup process.
         If you wish to minimize the risk of losing valued belongings, you
should try to keep those belongings on your person at all times, in a storage
facility, or in visible, sanitary, and safely accessible bags or bins.
         If you think your belongings were stored, you can claim them by
following the directions on the impound notice after the clean-up is complete.
You may retrieve any stored belongings without being asked about your
immigration status.”
      (2)   After 72 hours, the Town Manager shall be authorized to conduct
abatement or clean-up of the site on the date posted on the notice of clean-up.
If abatement is delayed or rescheduled, the Town Manager may conduct abatement
within 72 hours of the posted notice of clean-up without reposting a new notice
of clean-up. If abatement is delayed for a longer period of time, the Town
Manager shall repost a notice of clean-up with a new date.
   (B)   The Town Manager shall follow these additional procedures when persons
are present at an encampment during abatement:
      (1)   The Town Manager shall evaluate reasonable requests for additional
time or assistance to remove items and may accommodate those requests to the
extent practicable.
      (2)   Any person who returns to an encampment during abatement shall be
allowed to remove their personal property from the site. Personal property left
behind will be deemed abandoned.
      (3)   Any person arrested for a criminal offense or an outstanding
warrant shall not be required to abandon personal property they identify as
their own. Unless the person requests the personal property be discarded or
entrusted to another, all personal property of apparent value will be impounded
by the town in accordance with existing policy and procedure. Where the owner
of the items cannot be readily identified or discovered, the Town Manager shall
follow the abatement process in this chapter.
   (C)   The Town Manager shall document the abatement process as follows:
      (1)   Photograph or video record the site before any abatement begins;
      (2)   When feasible, open backpacks, purses, suitcases, and other small
storage containers to determine whether they contain items eligible for
storage; and
      (3)   Photograph or video record the site after abatement has concluded.
   (D)   (1)   Unclaimed items found in abatement shall be eligible for storage
if:
         (a)   Circumstances indicate that the item belongs to a person;
         (b)   The item has apparent utility in its current condition and
circumstances; and
         (c)   The item can be safely retrieved from the site.
      (2)   Examples of items potentially eligible for storage include
identification and associated paperwork, medication stored in medication
bottles with identifying information, art, art supplies, musical instruments,
and items that reasonably appear to have sentimental value in their current
condition. An item need not be in a new or perfect condition to have apparent
utility.
   (E)   An eligible item found during an abatement shall be put into storage,
unless it meets one the following disqualifying conditions:
      (1)   Hazardous, including items contaminated with human waste or bodily
fluid, soiled items likely to expose others to disease, animal waste, insects,
explosives, weapons, liquids, drug paraphernalia, or mold;
      (2)   Likely to become hazardous in storage, including perishables, wet
materials that might become moldy, and items covered in mud;
      (3)   Practically un-storable, due to large size, weight, or other
similar characteristic;
      (4)   Contraband or stolen property; or
      (5)   Is on the Town Manager's current list of common types of items
that, in the experience of town staff, individuals regularly abandon during
abatement, and there is no contrary indication as to the specific item.
   (F)   The Town Manager shall record each eligible item to be stored,
including the location it was found and the date of storage. Any stored items
shall be kept in storage at least 30 calendar days and then may be disposed of,
recycled, or reused following the process in §
9.30.070.
   (G)   After abatement has concluded and when eligible items are collected
and will be placed in storage, the Town Manager shall post notices, in English
and Spanish, at the location of the abatement that includes information on how
a person may claim stored items. A person may retrieve stored items based on a
description with sufficient specificity to demonstrate ownership. A person may
retrieve stored items without inquiry into the person's immigration status.
   (H)   Expedited abatement.
      (1)   In an expedited abatement, the Town Manager shall follow the same
abatement and storage procedures in this section, but shall post a notice of
clean-up, in English and Spanish, giving a minimum of three hours for all
persons to remove their personal property.
      (2)   The Town Manager shall prioritize and expedite the removal of an
encampment if:
         (a)   The town receives direction from Marin County or other
governmental authority that abatement of the encampment is necessary to
preserve public health or safety, including to address known or suspected
outbreaks of diseases; or
         (b)   The Town Manager observes or reasonably suspects the encampment
creates a condition that presents a significant risk of property damage, bodily
injury or death.
(Ord. 895, passed 1-9-2025)
§ 9.30.070 ABANDONED PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Any personal property or possessions located on public property that
are unattended and whose owner cannot be readily identified are presumed to be
abandoned and, pursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 2080.7, any contrary provisions
regarding procedures for unclaimed property in this code do not apply. The Town
Manager shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain whether the unattended
personal property or possessions have been abandoned and, if so, to thereafter
cause their removal. Any personal property or possessions found during the
abatement process shall first be stored as required by this chapter.
   (B)   Unattended personal property or possessions that are unsanitary,
soiled contain evidence of vermin may be summarily abated and destroyed.
Unattended personal property or possessions that are not summarily abated or
destroyed under this section may be disposed of or recycled by the Town Manager
or donated for reuse.
(Ord. 895, passed 1-9-2025)
§ 9.30.080 ENFORCEMENT.
   It is unlawful for a person to violate or to fail to comply with any
provision of this chapter. If an encampment is found on public property by any
member of the public, a report of such encampment must be made to the Fairfax
Police Department. No member of the public is permitted to attempt any
enforcement or harassment of any person potentially in violation of any
provision of this chapter. The town may enforce any provision of this chapter
by any one or more of the following methods:

to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard
to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and
insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare.
Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative
vehicle or parts thereof, on private or public property, except as expressly
hereinafter permitted, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be
abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

applicants may be exempted from the electric vehicle changing requirements on a
case-by-case basis where the local enforcing agency has determined EV charging
and infrastructure are not feasible based upon one or more of the following
conditions:
      (1)   Where there is no commercial power supply or the local utility is
unable to supply adequate power.
      (2)   Where there is evidence suitable to the local enforcing agency
substantiating that additional local utility infrastructure design
requirements, directly related to the implementation of section 4.106.4 and
A5.106.5 may adversely impact the construction cost of the project.
      (3)   ADUs and JADUs without additional parking facilities.
      (4)   Parking spaces accessible only by automated mechanical car parking
systems are not required to comply with CALGreen Code section 4.106.4 and
A5.106.5
   (C)   Hardship or infeasibility exemption. If an applicant for a covered
project believes that circumstances exist that make it a hardship or infeasible
to meet the requirements of this chapter, the applicant may request an
exemption as set forth below. In applying for an exemption, the burden is on
the applicant to show hardship or infeasibility.
      (1)   Application. Based on the following, the applicant shall identify
in writing the specific requirements of the standards for compliance that the
project is unable to achieve and the circumstances that make it a hardship or
infeasible for the project to comply with this chapter. The applicant may not
petition for relief from any requirement of the 2022 California Energy Code
(Title 24, Part 6) and referenced standards, or the 2022 California Green
Building Standards (Title 24, Part 11) of the California Building Standards
Code. Circumstances that constitute hardship or infeasibility shall include one
of the following:
         (a)   That the cost of achieving compliance is disproportionate to the
overall cost of the project;
         (b)   That strict compliance with these standards would create or
maintain a hazardous condition(s) and present a life safety risk to the
occupants;
         (c)   There is a conflict between the provisions of the applicable
green building rating system and the California Building Standards Code, other
state code provisions, other requirements of this title or conditions imposed
on the project through a previously approved planning application;   
         (d)   That compliance with certain requirements would impair the
historic integrity of buildings listed on a local, state or federal list or
register of historic structures as regulated by the California Historic
Building Code (Title 24, Part 8).
      (2)   Granting of exemption. If the chief building official determines
that it is a hardship or infeasible for the applicant to fully meet the
requirements of this chapter and that granting the requested exemption will not
cause the building to fail to comply with the 2022 California Energy Code
(Title 24, Part 6) and referenced standards, or the 2022 California Green
Building Standards (Title 24, Part 11) of the California Building Standards
Code, the chief building official shall determine the maximum feasible
threshold of compliance reasonably achievable for the project. In making this
determination, the chief building official shall consider whether alternate,
practical means of achieving the objectives of this chapter can be satisfied,
such as reducing comparable energy use at an off-site location within the
county. If an exemption is granted, the applicant shall be required to comply
with this chapter in all other respects and shall be required to achieve the
threshold of compliance determined to be achievable by the chief building
official.
      (3)   Denial of exception. If the chief building official determines that
it is reasonably possible for the applicant to fully meet the requirements of
this chapter, the request shall be denied, and the applicant shall be notified
of the decision in writing. The project and compliance documentation shall be
modified to comply with the standards for compliance.
      (4)   Appeal. Any aggrieved applicant or person may appeal the
determination of the chief building official regarding the granting or denial
of an exemption or compliance with any other provision of this chapter. An
appeal of a determination of the chief building official shall be filed in
writing and processed in accordance with the provisions of § 15.04.028 of this
code.

15.05.090   Periodic review
§ 15.05.010 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The Fairfax Town Council finds and expressly declares as follows:
   (A)   Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion as
well as leakage occurring during natural gas procurement, transportation,
storage, and distribution produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that
contribute to global warming and climate change.
   (B)   The following addition to the Fairfax Municipal Code is reasonably
necessary because of local climatic, geologic, and topographical conditions as
listed below:
      (1)   The town is situated along a wildland-urban interface and is
extremely vulnerable to wildfires and firestorms, and human activities
releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere cause increases in worldwide
average temperature, drought conditions, vegetative fuel, and length of fire
seasons.
      (2)   Structures in the town are located in close proximity to the San
Andreas and Hayward seismic faults, which collectively and individually
maintain the potential to produce serious damage, fires, and/or explosions as a
result of damage to natural gas infrastructure in buildings due to
unforeseeable seismic activity.
      (3)   The town has a history of significant flooding from the Fairfax and
San Anselmo Creeks and their tributaries. Extreme weather conditions resulting
from climate change may result in sudden, prolonged rainfall leading to further
flooding events.
   (C)   The following addition to the Fairfax Municipal Code is also
reasonably necessary because of health and safety concerns as Fairfax residents
suffer from asthma and other health conditions associated with poor indoor and
outdoor air quality exacerbated by the combustion of natural gas.
   (D)   As described in the Town of Fairfax Climate Action Plan and Fairfax
Climate Emergency Declaration (Resolution No. 19-04) rapid, far-reaching and
unprecedented changes in all aspects of society are required to limit global
warming and the resulting environmental threat posed by climate change,
including the prompt phasing out of natural gas as a fuel for heating and
cooling infrastructure in new buildings.
   (E)   Substitute electric heating and cooling infrastructure in new
buildings fueled by less greenhouse gas intensive electricity is linked to
significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and is cost competitive because of
the aggregate cost savings associated with all electric designs that avoid new
gas infrastructure and increasing natural gas fuel prices.
   (F)   All-electric building design benefits the health, welfare, and
resiliency of Fairfax and its residents.
   (G)   The most cost-effective time to integrate electrical infrastructure is
in the design phase of a building project because building systems and spaces
can be designed to optimize the performance of electrical systems inasmuch as
projects can take full advantage of avoided costs and space requirements from
the elimination of natural gas piping and equipment venting systems.
   (H)   The intent of this chapter is to eliminate natural gas infrastructure
and associated greenhouse gas emissions in new buildings where all-electric
infrastructure can be most practicably integrated, thereby reducing the
environmental and health hazards produced by the consumption and transportation
of natural gas.

BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Newly constructed buildings shall be all-electric buildings as defined
in §
15.05.030.
      (1)   Exception: Natural gas infrastructure may be permitted in a newly
constructed building if the applicant establishes that it is not physically
feasible to construct the building without natural gas infrastructure. For
purposes of this exception, "physically feasible" to construct the building
means either an all-electric prescriptive compliance approach is available for
the building under the Energy Code or the building is able to achieve the
performance compliance standards under the Energy Code using commercially
available technology and an approved calculation method.
      (2)   Exception: The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to
development projects that have obtained vested rights prior to the effective
date of this chapter pursuant to a preliminary affordable housing project
application in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code § 65589.5(o), a development
agreement in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code § 65866, a vesting tentative map

provided that the entitling or permitting body establishes that the use serves
the public interest. In determining whether the construction of natural gas
infrastructure is in the public interest, the town may consider:
      (1)   The availability of alternative technologies or systems that do not
use natural gas;
      (2)   Any other impacts that the decision to allow natural gas
infrastructure may have on the health, safety, or welfare of the public.
   (B)   If the installation of natural gas infrastructure is granted under a
public interest exemption, the newly constructed buildings shall nonetheless be
required at the minimum to have sufficient electric capacity, wiring and
conduit to facilitate future full building electrification.

in this section.
   (A)   Determination of completeness. Upon receipt of a tentative subdivision
map and any accompanying information, the Planning Director shall make a
determination of application completeness pursuant to §
16.08.020 of this code.
   (B)   Incomplete applications. Applications deemed incomplete shall be
subject to the procedures set forth in §
16.08.020 of this code.
   (C)   Transmittal. If the application is found to be complete, the Planning
Director shall transmit copies of the tentative map together with accompanying
data to such public agencies and utilities as may be concerned or required by
Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 66453 and 66455.
   (D)   Town Engineer review. The Town Engineer shall submit a written report
to the Planning Director of recommendations in relation to the requirements of
this chapter, the Subdivision Map Act and other applicable ordinances and
regulations and changes that are necessary for proper consideration of the map.
      (1)   Water and sewer recommendations. If the tentative map proposes
sewage disposal by a means other than a public sewer system or water supply by
means other than a public facility, then the applicant shall consult with the
Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and the Marin County Environmental
Health Department and the Engineer’s report shall state whether the proposed
method of sewage disposal or water supply does or does not create a biological
or chemical water quality and/or health hazard. If it would create such a
hazard then a proven and RWQCB approved alternate system may be recommended and
such recommendation must be included as a condition of approval of the
tentative map. If no satisfactory method of sewage disposal or water supply is
presented, then the tentative map shall be disapproved. If the tentative map
shows sewage disposal by a public sewer system or water by means of a public
water system, then the Planning Director shall, within three days after the
filing of the tentative map, transmit a copy thereof to the appropriate water
or sewer agency with a request that the agency report within ten days showing
its ability to serve the proposed subdivision.
      (2)   Transmittal to school districts. Within five days after accepting a
tentative map application, the Planning Director shall send a notice of the
acceptance to the governing board of any elementary school, high school or
unified school district within the boundaries of which the subdivision is
proposed to be located. The notice shall identify information about the
location of the proposed subdivision, the number of units, density and other
information which would be relevant to the affected school district. Within 15
days after receiving the notice, the school district may make recommendation to
the town regarding the effect of the proposed subdivision upon the school
district. If the school district fails to respond within 15 days the failure to
respond shall be deemed approval of the proposed subdivision. The town shall
consider any recommendations before acting on the tentative map.
   (E)   Planning Director review. The Planning Director shall submit a written
report to the Planning Commission of recommendations in relation to the
requirements of this chapter, the general plan, the zoning ordinance and the
other applicable ordinances and regulations.
   (F)   Recommendations to subdivider. Pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 66452.3,
all recommendations and reports prepared by town staff on the tentative map
shall be forwarded to the subdivider prior to any hearing or action on the map.
In instances of a residential condominium conversion, all tenants shall receive
the town staff reports.

§ 16.12.020 CONSISTENCY.
   No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative
map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the Subdivision Map Act, the
general plan and planned development plan or applicable specific plan, or any
other provision of this code.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.020) (Ord. 670, passed - -1998)
§ 16.12.030 APPLICABILITY.
   A vesting tentative map may be filed pursuant to the provisions of this
section.
   (A)   Filing permitted. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as
implemented and supplemented by this chapter, requires the filing of a
tentative map for any development, a vesting tentative map may be filed
instead, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
   (B)   Vesting tentative map not required. If a subdivider does not seek the
rights conferred by the vesting tentative map statute, the filing of a vesting
tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed
subdivision, permit for construction or work preparatory to construction.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.030) (Ord. 670, passed - -1998)
§ 16.12.040 FILING.
   (A)   A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same manner as set forth
in
Chapter 16.08, except as provided otherwise by this chapter.
   (B)   At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have “vesting
tentative map” printed conspicuously on its face.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.040) (Ord. 670, passed - -1998)
§ 16.12.050 CONTENTS.
   A vesting tentative map shall contain the information required by
Chapter 16.24.

§ 16.12.060 INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   A vesting tentative map shall be accompanied by the accompanying data and
reports required in
Chapter 16.08.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.060) (Ord. 670, passed - -1998)
§ 16.12.070 PROCESSING.
   A vesting tentative map shall be processed in the same manner as a tentative
map as set forth in
Chapter 16.08.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.070) (Ord. 670, passed - -1998)
§ 16.12.080 EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION.
   The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire
at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same
extensions, as established for the expiration of the approval or conditional
approval of a tentative map.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.080) (Ord. 670, passed - -1998)
§ 16.12.090 VESTING ON APPROVAL.
   An approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall confer
rights as set forth in this section.
   (A)   Vested rights. The approval or conditional approval of a vesting
tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in
substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in
the Cal. Gov’t Code § 66498.1.
   (B)   Exceptions. Notwithstanding division (A) of this section, a permit,
approval, extension or entitlement may be conditioned or denied if either of
the following is determined:
      (1)   Failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision, the
immediate community or both in a condition dangerous to their health, safety or
both; or
      (2)   The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state
or federal law.
   (C)   Time periods. The vested rights referred to herein shall expire if a
final map or parcel map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting
tentative map as provided in §
16.12.080. If the final map or parcel map is approved, vested rights shall
continue as follows:
      (1)   Vested rights shall remain in effect for an initial time period of
one-year from recordation of the final or parcel map. Where several final maps
are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting
tentative map, this one-year initial time period shall begin for each phase
when the final map for that phase is recorded. All of the final maps must be
recorded within the time period set forth in §
16.08.080 or the vesting tentative map approval shall expire for those parcels
for which final maps are not timely recorded.
      (2)   At any time prior to the expiration of the one-year time period set
forth in division (C)(1) of this section, the subdivider may apply for a one-
year extension. Requests for extension shall be submitted in writing to the
Planning Director and shall be subject to fees as established by the Town
Council.
      (3)   The one-year initial time period set forth in division (C)(1) of
this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a
complete application for a grading permit, if one is required, or for any
required design or architectural review, if the processing exceeds 30 days from
the date a complete application is filed.
      (4)   If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building
permit during the periods of time specified in divisions (C)(1), (2) and (3) of
this section, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration
of that permit, or any extension of that permit.
   (D)   Subsequent conditioning. Consistent with division (A) of this section,
an approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall not limit the
review authority from imposing reasonable conditions on subsequent required
approvals or permits necessary for the development.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.090) (Ord. 670, passed - -1998)
§ 16.12.100 FEES.
   Upon filing a vesting tentative map, a fee as established by resolution of
the Town Council shall be required. As a condition of approval, the review
authority may require the payment, by the subdivider, of all development fees
at the time of the application for a building permit or other similar permit.
The rate for the fees shall be that which is in effect at the time of the map
application.

match the existing primary dwelling unit in exterior materials, color, and
dominant roof pitch. The dominant roof slope is the slope shared by the largest
portion of the roof.
            2.   If there is no legal primary dwelling on the lot before the
urban lot split, and if two primary dwellings are developed on the lot, the
dwellings shall match each other in exterior materials, color, and dominant
roof pitch. The dominant roof slope is the slope shared by the largest portion
of the roof.

prevent direct offsite illumination, the minimum number of fixtures necessary
to provide pathway, stair/step, and entry illumination, and a maximum of two
foot candles lighting intensity. No landscape lighting is allowed.
            4.   No window or door of a dwelling that is constructed on the lot
after the urban lot split may have a direct line of sight to an adjoining
residential property. Fencing, landscaping, or privacy glass may be used to
provide screening and prevent a direct line of sight.
            5.   If a dwelling is constructed on a lot after an urban lot split

comply with all current local building standards. An urban lot split is a
change of use.
      (11)   Fire-hazard mitigation measures.
         (a)   A lot shall comply with each of the following fire-hazard
mitigation measures:
            1.   All enclosed structures on the site shall have fire
sprinklers.
            2.   Windows in any portion of a dwelling with less than a five-
foot setback to a property line shall be equipped with heat activated self-
closing shutters.
            3.   All sides of all dwellings on the site shall be within a 150-
foot hose-pull distance from either the public right of way or of an onsite
fire hydrant or standpipe.
            4.   A lot shall have direct access to a public right of way with a
paved street with a minimum width consisting of a net horizontal unobstructed
clearance of not less than 20 feet exclusive of gutters, curbs, and shoulders,
that connects to a designated evacuation route.
         (b)   Prior to submitting an application for an urban lot split, the
applicant shall obtain a certificate of compliance with all applicable fire-
hazard mitigation measures in accordance with this division (E)(11). The town
or its authorized agent shall inspect the site, including all structures on the
site, and certify as to its compliance. The certificate shall be included with
the application. The applicant shall pay the town's costs for inspection.
Failure to pay is grounds for denying the application.
      (12)   Separate conveyance.
         (a)   Within a resulting lot.
            1.   Primary dwelling units on a lot that is created by an urban
lot split may not be owned or conveyed separately from each other.
            2.   Common interest developments, as defined by Cal. Civil Code §
4100, are not permitted on a lot that is created by an urban lot split.
            3.   All fee interest in a lot and all dwellings on the lot shall
be held equally and undivided by all individual property owners.
         (b)   Between resulting lots. Separate conveyance of the resulting
lots is permitted. If dwellings or other structures (such as garages) on
different lots are adjacent or attached to each other, the urban lot split
boundary may separate them for conveyance purposes if the structures meet
building code safety standards, including but not limited to
Chapter 8.04 and
Chapter 15.04, and are sufficient to allow separate conveyance. If any attached
structures span or will span the new lot line, the owner shall record
appropriate covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&R's), easements, or
other documentation that is necessary to allocate rights and responsibility
between the owners of the two lots.
      (13)   Regulation of uses.
         (a)   Residential-only. No non-residential use is permitted on any lot
created by urban lot split.
         (b)   No short term rentals. No dwelling unit on a lot that is created
by an urban lot split may be rented for a period of less than 30 days.
         (c)   Owner occupancy. The applicant for an urban lot split shall sign
an affidavit stating that the applicant intends to occupy one of the dwelling
units on one of the resulting lots as the applicant's principal residence for a
minimum of three years after the urban lot split is approved.
      (14)   Notice of construction.
         (a)   At least 30 business days before starting any construction of a
structure on a lot created by an urban lot split, the property owner shall give
written notice to all the owners of record of each of the adjacent residential
parcels, which notice shall include the following information:
            1.   Notice that construction has been authorized,
            2.   The anticipated start and end dates for construction,
            3.   The hours of construction,
            4.   Contact information for the project manager (for construction-
related complaints), and
            5.   Contact information for the Department of Planning and
Building Services.
         (b)   This notice requirement does not confer a right on the noticed
persons or on anyone else to comment on the project before permits are issued.
Approval is ministerial. Under state law, the town has no discretion in
approving or denying a particular project under this section. This notice
requirement is purely to promote neighborhood awareness and expectation.
      (15)   Deed restriction. The owner shall record a deed restriction,
acceptable to the town, that does each of the following:
         (a)   Expressly prohibits any rental of any dwelling on the property
for a period of less than 30 days.
         (b)   Expressly prohibits any non-residential use of the lots created
by the urban lot split.
         (c)   Expressly prohibits any separate conveyance of a primary
dwelling on the property, any separate fee interest, and any common interest
development within the lot.
         (d)   States that the property is formed by an urban lot split and is
therefore subject to the town's urban lot split regulations, including all
applicable limits on dwelling size and development.
   (F)   Specific adverse impacts.
      (1)   Notwithstanding anything else in this section, the town may deny an
application for an urban lot split if the Building Official makes a written
finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the project would have
a "specific, adverse impact" on either public health and safety or on the
physical environment and for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
      (2)   "Specific adverse impact" has the same meaning as in Cal. Gov’t
Code § 65589.5(d)(2): "a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable
impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety
standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application
was deemed complete" and does not include (1) inconsistency with the zoning
ordinance or general plan land use designation or (2) the eligibility to claim
a welfare exemption under Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code section 214(g).
      (3)   The Building Official may consult with and be assisted by planning
staff and others as necessary in making a finding of specific, adverse impact.

this section:
         (a)   Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for
residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this section.
However, a condition may be placed on the approval of the parcel map that if a

issuance of the permit.
         (b)   Commercial and industrial subdivisions and condominium projects
or stock cooperatives which consist of subdivision of airspace in an existing
apartment building more than five years old when no new dwelling units are
added.
      (5)   Payment of fees. Only the payment of fees may be required in
subdivisions containing 50 parcels or less, except that when a condominium

66477(f).
      (7)   Dedications and fees. Land dedications and fees shall be determined
as set forth in this division.
         (a)   Formula for dedication of land. Where a park or recreation
facility has been designated in the town general plan, and is to be located in
whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate
land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable
relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the
subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to
the following formulas:
            1.   Alternative 1: formula based on population estimate. The
formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as set forth in the
Table 16.24-1. This table is based on 1990 U.S. Census information and has been
established pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 66477(b).
Table 16.24-1
 
Dwelling Type   Assumed Density (Person/ Standard (Acres/ Dwelling Unit)
                Dwelling Unit)
Single-family   2.5 persons/DU           0.0075
Duplex/         1.87 persons/DU          0.00561
multiple-family
 
            2.   Alternative 2: formula based on dwelling units. Table 16.24-2,
which contains the formula for determining acreage to be dedicated based on
dwelling units, is based on 1990 U.S. Census information and has been
established pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 66477(b).
Table 16.24-2
 
Dwelling Type  Zoning District          Assumed Density  Standard

Duplex/        RD 5.5-7, UR-7 (PDD), RM 1.87 persons/ DU 5 acres/ 535 DUs
multiple
 
            3.   Alternative 3; population formula. At any future point in
time, after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, when updated
U.S. Census information is released to the general public and accepted as
accurate by the town, the formula set forth in the following table for
determining parkland to be dedicated shall be substituted for divisions (G)(1)
(a) and (b) of this section.
Table 16.24-3
 
Average number of persons/unit - 1,000 population = Minimum acreage dedication
                                 5 acres
 
         (b)   Improvements. The subdivider shall, without credit:
            1.   Provide full street improve- ments and utility connections
including, but not limited to curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control
devices, street lighting, street trees, retaining walls and sidewalks to land
which is dedicated pursuant to this section;
            2.   Provide for fencing along the property line of that portion of
the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land; and
            3.   Provide other minimal improvements which the Town Council
determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational
purposes.
         (c)   Formula for fees. If there is no park or recreation facility
designated in the town general plan, to be located in whole or in part within
the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land,
pay a fee equal to value of that land. Fees shall be determined in accordance
with Table 16.24-4. The fees shall be used for a local park which bears a
reasonable relationship to serve the present and future residents of the area
being subdivided.
Table 16.24-4
 
DUs X Population X 5 Acres          X FMV of Land  = In Lieu Fee
      DU           1,000 Population   Land acreage
NOTES TO TABLE:
Where:
DUs = Number of dwelling units
FMV = Fair market value as determined by division (B)(7)(e) of this
section
Land acreage = The total acreage of the property
 
         (d)   Number of dwelling units. For the purpose of this section, the
number of new dwelling units shall be based upon the number of parcels
indicated on the map when in an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel.
When all or part of the subdivision is located in an area zoned for more than
one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units in the area
so zoned shall equal the maximum allowed under the zone. In the case of a
condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number of
condominium units. The term “new dwelling units” does not include dwelling
units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is
filed.
         (e)   Fair market value. The fair market value shall be determined by
the town with a written appraisal report prepared and signed by an appraiser
acceptable to the town. The appraisal shall be made immediately prior to the
filing of the final map. The subdivider shall notify the town of the expected
filing date at least six weeks prior to filing the final map. If more than one
year elapses prior to filing the final map, the town will prepare a new
appraisal and will bill the subdivider for the cost of the reappraisal. If the
subdivider objects to the determined fair market value, the subdivider may
appeal to the Town Council. The determination of the fair market value shall
consider, but shall not be limited to the following:
            1.   Approval of and conditions of the tentative subdivision map;
            2.   The general plan;
            3.   Zoning;
            4.   Property location;
            5.   Off-site improvements facil- itating use of the property;
            6.   Site characteristics of the property; and
            7.   Comparable property transactions within the market area.
         (f)   Use of money. Any in-lieu fees collected shall be used only for
the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or rehabilitating
existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the
subdivision.
      (8)   Fees. Any fees collected pursuant to this section shall be
committed within five years after payment of the fees or the issuance of
building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever
occurs later. If the fees are not committed, they, without any deductions,
shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in
the same proportion that the size of each lot bears to the total area of all
lots in the subdivision.
      (9)   Development schedule. The Town Council shall specify in a public
lands development plan how, when and where it will use the land or fees or both
to develop park or recreational facilities.
      (10)   Credits. Credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land
required by this section shall be given in accordance with the provisions of
the following divisions:
         (a)   If the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to
the dedicated land, the value of the improvements together with any equipment
located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of
land required by this section.
         (b)   Planned developments, real estate developments, stock
cooperatives and community apartment projects, as defined in Cal. Business and
Professions Code §§ 11003, 11003.1, 11003.2, 11003.4 and 11004 and

have been made within two years from the date the final or parcel map was filed
for record, or within the time allowed by agreement for completion of the
improvements, whichever is later; or
   (C)   Recordation. No lots shown on the final or parcel map have been sold

      S = Average slope (in percent)
      I = Contour interval (in feet)
      L = Total length of all contour lines on the parcel measured from where
the contour lines intersect with the property lines of the parcel (in feet)
      A = Area of subject parcel (in square feet)

§ 17.010.080 DETERMINING FLOOR AREA.
   The floor area of a building is the sum of the gross horizontal areas of all
floors of a building or other enclosed structure, measured from the outside
perimeter of the exterior walls and/or the centerline of interior walls.
   (A)   Floor area includes, but is not limited to, all habitable space (as
defined in the town's construction codes) that is below the roof and within the
outer surface of the main walls of principal or accessory buildings, the
centerlines of party walls separating such buildings or portions thereof, or
lines drawn parallel to and two feet within the roof line of any building
without walls. In the case of a multi-story building that has covered or
enclosed stairways, stairwells, or elevator shafts, the horizontal area of such
features shall be counted only once at the floor level of their greatest area
of horizontal extent.
   (B)   Floor area does not include the following: mechanical, electrical, and
communication equipment rooms that do not exceed two percent of the building's
gross floor area; bay windows, decks, or other architectural projections where
the vertical distance between the lowest surface of the projection and the
finished floor is 30 inches or greater; areas that qualify as usable open
space; and, in non-residential buildings, areas used for off-street parking
spaces or loading spaces, driveways, ramps between floors of a multi-level
parking garage, and maneuvering aisles that are located below the finish grade
of the property.
   (C)   For non-residential uses, gross floor area includes interior walkways
interior courtyards, walkways, paseos, and corridors covered by a roof or
skylight. Non-residential gross floor area does not include arcades, porticoes,
and similar open areas that are located at or near street level and are
accessible to the general public but are not designed or used as sales,
display, storage, service, or production areas.
(Ord. 885, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 17.010.090 DETERMINING FLOOR AREA RATIO.
   The floor area ratio (FAR) is the ratio of the floor area, excluding the
areas described below, of all principal and accessory buildings on a site to
the site area. To calculate the FAR, floor area is divided by site area, and
typically expressed as a decimal. For example, if the floor area of all
buildings on a site totals 20,000 square feet, and the site area is 10,000
square feet, the FAR is expressed as 2.0. See
Chapter 17.136 for additional regulations that apply to existing structures.
The following are excluded from the floor area when calculating FAR.
      (1)   Garages and carports. 500 square feet for a single-family
residence; 800 square feet for garage space for a duplex; and 400 square feet
for a townhouse constructed as a series of single-family dwellings.
      (2)   Parking for multi-family structures. Parking areas located below
finished grade or finished floor of habitable space where the vertical distance
between finished grade and finished floor of the parking level is five feet or
more. Structured parking areas located above finished grade where the vertical
distance between finished grade and the floor of the parking level is five feet
or less.

§ 17.010.100 DETERMINING LOT COVERAGE.
   Lot coverage is the ratio of the total footprint area of all impervious
surfaces on a lot to the net lot area, typically expressed as a percentage. The
footprints of all principal and accessory structures, including garages,
carports, covered patios, and roofed porches, combined with all impervious
driveways, walkway and other surfaces shall be summed in order to calculate lot
coverage. The following shall be excluded from the calculation:
   (A)   Eaves and roof overhangs projecting up to two feet from a wall;
   (B)   Trellises and similar structures that have roofs that are at least 50
percent open to the sky with uniformly distributed openings;
   (C)   Swimming pools and hot tubs that are not enclosed in roofed structures
or decks; and
   (D)   Driveway, walkways, patios, decks and other flat surfaces built with
pervious materials.

§ 17.010.110 DETERMINING LOT FRONTAGE.
   (A)   The front of a lot that is not a corner lot or through lot is the lot
line along the street frontage.
   (B)   The front of a corner lot is the narrowest dimension of the lot with
street frontage.
   (C)   Except in the case of a panhandle lot, the front yard of a through lot
is the one that abuts the street that adjoining lots use to provide primary
access into the dwellings on these lots. The opposite yard is considered a rear
yard.
   (D)   In the case of a through lot, the narrowest dimension is the front
yard (that is not a panhandle). If same dimension, staff shall determine the
front yard.
   (E)   If a panhandle lot, then the front yard is the one adjoining the
widest portion of the lot that faces the street. (see graphic 17.010 (J).

 § 17.010.120 DETERMININ G SETBACKS.
   A setback line defining a required yard is parallel to and at the specified
distance from the corresponding front, side, or rear lot line. The following
regulations for determining yards apply when a lot abuts a proposed street or
alley.
   (A)   If a property abuts an existing or proposed street for which the
existing right-of-way is narrower than the right-of-way ultimately required for
the street, the required setback shall be established from the future right-of-
way rather than the property line.
   (B)   If a side lot line abuts an alley, the yard shall be considered an
interior side yard rather than a corner side yard. In computing the minimum
yard for any lot where such yard abuts an alley, no part of the width of the
alley may be considered as part of the required yard.
   (C)   Setbacks shall be measured as the distance between the nearest lot
line and the closest point on the exterior of a building or structure along a
line at right angles to the lot line. Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the
ground to the sky except where projections into yards are allowed by §
17.044.070.

   The minimum distance shall be measured from the edge of any table, chair,
bench, planter, or other appurtenance used as part of an outdoor dining area to
any obstruction within the sidewalk area. The distance from the back of a chair
shall account for a seated person.

§ 17.016.010 DEFINITIONS; PURPOSE.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE.
      (1)   A use of a structure or land which was lawfully established and
maintained prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, but
which, under this title, does not conform with the use regulations of the
district in which it is located. This chapter is intended to limit the number
and extent of non-conforming uses by prohibiting their enlargement and their
reestablishment after abandonment and by prohibiting the alteration of the
structures they occupy and their restoration after destruction. Eventually
certain classes of non-conforming uses are to be eliminated.
      (2)   A structure which was lawfully erected prior to the adoption of the
ordinance codified in thistitle, but which, under this title, does not conform
with the standards of coverage, maximum floor area, yard spaces, height of
structures or distances between structures prescribed in the regulations for
the district in which the structure is located. While permitting the use and
maintenance of non-conforming structures, this chapter is intended to limit the
number and extent of non-conforming structures by prohibiting their being
moved, altered or enlarged so as to increase the discrepancy between existing
conditions and the standards prescribed in this title, and by prohibiting their
restoration after destruction. Eventually all non-conforming structures of
nominal value are to be eliminated or altered to conform.

§ 17.016.030 ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   No structure, the use of which is non-conforming, shall be moved,
altered or enlarged unless required by law or unless the moving, alteration or
enlargement will result in the elimination of the non-conforming use.
   (B)   No structure partially occupied by a non-conforming use shall be
moved, altered or enlarged in such a way as to permit the enlargement of the
space occupied by the non-conforming use.
   (C)   No non-conforming use shall be enlarged or extended in such a way as

commercial uses that are not related to fossil fuel sales and that are
otherwise provided for in the regulations applicable to the Highway Commercial
zoning district and provided the owner or operator complies with all applicable
procedures and permit requirements of the Town Code.
       (5)   A filling (service) station use shall not be re-established if
such use has been discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days or more, or
has been changed to, or replaced by, a conforming use. If the use has
discontinued for reasons of construction under a valid building permit, the
Public Works Director may extend the 180-day timeframe when presented with
documentation demonstrating construction has been pursued diligently and
timely.
       (6)   A filling (service) station may conduct building and site design
modifications or renovations intended to improve or maintain the appearance of
the station or the parcel on which it is constructed. Such modifications may
include, but not be limited to, modifications or renovations of building
façade, signs, landscaping and hardscape, provided the owner or operator
complies with all applicable procedures and permit requirements of the Town

all applicable procedures and permit requirements of the Town Code.
       (8)   A filling (service) station may undergo normal maintenance,
replacement and repairs, including, but not limited to, painting, re-roofing,
sign replacement, fossil fuel dispensing equipment upgrades and similar
modifications, provided the owner or operator complies with all applicable
procedures and permit requirements of the Town Code.
       (9)   A filling (service) station that is damaged or destroyed by any
means may be restored or reconstructed as it existed immediately prior to the
damage or destruction, provided the owner or operator complies with all
applicable procedures and permit requirements of the Town Code and such
restoration or reconstruction is completed, as confirmed with a final building
inspection, within two years of the date of damage or destruction. Failure to
complete such restoration or reconstruction within the two-year timeframe shall
constitute abandonment of the use.

§ 17.026.060 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS; REVIEW AND APPROVAL.
   (A)   An applicant shall file a notice of intent to submit an application in
the form of a Preliminary Application that includes all of the information
required by Cal. Gov't Code § 65941.1 as that section read on January 1, 2020.
Complete building permit applications for the project shall be submitted
concurrently with the preliminary application. Planning staff shall provide
templates for preliminary applications to applicants on request and shall be
available on the town's website. The preliminary application shall be
accompanied by the required fee as established by the town.
   (B)   Within 180 calendar days after filing a preliminary application, an
applicant shall submit a formal application for ministerial review, provided
scoping consultation has concluded consistent with division (C), below.
   (C)   Scoping consultation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of the preliminary application, the town shall contact
the Native American Heritage Commission for assistance in identifying any
California Native American tribe that should be notified. The Planning Director
shall provide a formal notice of the applicant's intent to submit a formal
application to each required California Native American tribe within 30 days of
preliminary application submittal. The formal notice shall be consistent with
Cal. Gov't Code § 65913.4(b).
      (2)   If within 30 days of receipt of the formal notice, any California
Native American tribe that was formally noticed accepts the invitation to
engage in scoping consultation, the Planning Director shall commence scoping
consultation within 30 days of receiving that response.
      (3)   The scoping consultation shall be conducted consistent with Cal.
Gov't Code § 65913.4(b). If, after scoping consultation is concluded, a
development is not eligible for a streamlined ministerial approval, the
Planning Director shall provide written documentation as required by Cal. Gov't
Code § 65913.4(b) to the applicant and any California Native American tribe
that is a party to that scoping consultation.
      (4)   Tribal consultation concludes either 1) upon documentation of an
enforceable agreement regarding the treatment of tribal resources at the
project site or 2) one or more parties to the consultation, acting in good
faith and after a reasonable effort, conclude that a mutual agreement cannot be
achieved.
   (D)   If the development remains eligible to apply streamlined ministerial
approval after scoping consultation has concluded, an applicant may file a
formal application. Only the items necessary to determine compliance with the
provisions contained in Cal. Gov't Code § 65913.4(a) and with any applicable
objective standards shall be required.
   (E)   The review of a formal application shall be done by the Planning
Director to determine if the application complies with all of the provisions
contained in this chapter, Cal. Gov't Code § 65913.4(a), and applicable
objective standards and shall occur within the following timeframes:
      (1)   Within 90 calendar days of formal application submittal for
applications that include 150 or fewer housing units.
      (2)   Within 180 calendar days of formal application submittal for
applications that include 151 or more housing units.
   (F)   If the formal application does not demonstrate compliance with all of
the provisions contained in Cal. Gov't Code § 65913.4(a) and all applicable
objective standards, the Planning Director shall provide the applicant with
written documentation of which standards the development conflicts with and an
explanation of the reasons the development conflicts with each standard. If the
application can be brought into compliance with minor changes to the proposal
(e.g., changes in building dimensions that are less than ten percent), the
Planning Director may allow the development proponent to correct any
deficiencies within the timeframes for determining project consistency
specified in division (E)(2) above. For major changes, a new application will
be required.
   (G)   The Planning Director is the review authority for ministerial
approvals for qualifying housing developments. The Planning Director shall
approve a formal application upon finding that all of the requirements of Cal.
Gov't Code § 65913.4 and this chapter have been met. The Planning Director may
impose reasonable conditions of approval, provided those conditions of approval
are objective and broadly applicable to development within the town.
   (H)   Any necessary subsequent permits shall be issued on a ministerial
basis subject to applicable objective standards. If a public improvement is
necessary to implement a development subject to this chapter, and that public
improvement is located on land owned by the town, the town shall process any
approvals needed as required by Cal. Gov't Code § 65913.4(h).
   (I)   Post-Approval Modifications.
      (1)   An applicant or the Planning Director may request a modification to
an approved development if that request is made prior to the issuance of the
final building permit.
      (2)   The town shall only apply objective standards in effect when the
original application was submitted, except that objective standards adopted
after the date of original submittal may be applied in any of the following
instances:
         (a)   The total number of residential units or total square footage of
construction changes by 15 percent or more; or
         (b)   The total number of residential units or total square footage of
construction changes by five percent or more, and it is necessary to subject
the development to an objective standard beyond those in effect when the
application was submitted in order to mitigate or avoid a specific adverse
impact upon public health of safety, for which there is no feasible alternative
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid; or
         (c)   Objective building standards contained in the California
Building Code, as adopted by the town, may be applied to all modifications.
      (3)   The Planning Director shall determine if the modification is
consistent with applicable objective standards and issue a decision on the
applicant's modification request within 60 days after submittal.
      (4)   An application approved consistent with this chapter shall remain
valid for three years; however, an application approval shall not expire if the
development includes public investment in housing affordability, beyond tax
credits, where 50 percent of the units are affordable to households making at
or below 80 percent of the area median income consistent with Cal. Gov't Code §
65913.4(e).
      (5)   At the discretion of the Director, a one-year extension may be
granted consistent with Cal. Gov't Code § 65913.4(e)

(Ord. 885, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 17.027.050 APPLICATION FILING.

filing a preliminary application consistent with Government Code § 65941.1.
      (1)   A preliminary application shall be filed on the standardized form
adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community Development
unless the Planning Commission has adopted a form for use for SB330
applications.
      (2)   Within 180 calendar days after submitting a preliminary
application, an applicant shall submit a full application for the housing
development.
   (B)   An applicant may file a full application for a zoning permit for a
qualifying housing development without filing a preliminary application. The
full application shall be filed on a form provided by the Town of Fairfax
accompanied by the required fee. Complete building permit applications for a
qualifying housing project shall be submitted concurrently with the full
application.
   (C)   Compliance review.
      (1)   Scope of review. housing development for which a preliminary
application was submitted shall only be subject to the ordinances, policies,

is submitted, except in the following circumstances:
         (a)   A fee, charge, or other monetary exaction increase resulting
from an automatic annual adjustment based on an independently published cost
index that is referenced in the ordinance or resolution establishing the fee or
monetary exaction.
         (b)   A preponderance of the evidence in the record establishes that
subjecting the housing development to an ordinance, policy, or standard beyond
those in effect when the preliminary application was submitted is necessary to
mitigate or avoid a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety,
and there is no feasible alternative method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid
the adverse impact.
         (c)   Subjecting the housing development to an ordinance, policy,
standard, or any other measure, beyond those in effect when the preliminary
application was submitted is necessary to avoid or substantially lessen an
impact consistent with the California Environmental Quality Act.
         (d)   The housing development has not commenced construction within
2.5 years following the date of the housing development's final approval (as
defined in Cal. Gov't. Code § 65589.5(o)(1)(D)).

construction proposed changes by 20 percent or more, exclusive of any increase
resulting from a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or similar
provision.
      (2)   When no preliminary application was submitted, a housing
development shall be subject to objective standards in effect when the full
application was deemed complete.
(Ord. 885, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 17.027.060 REVIEW TIMEFRAMES.

   (A)   The Review Authority shall identify the specific objective standard(s)
that the project does not comply with and provide an explanation of the reason
(s) why the housing development is considered to be inconsistent or non-
compliant with identified provisions and shall provide the written
determination to the applicant.
   (B)   A housing development is considered in compliance with this title, and
shall not require a zoning map amendment, if the housing development complies
with objective general plan standards and land use designations, but the zoning
for the housing development site is inconsistent with the general plan.
   (C)   If a housing development complies with all of the applicable objective
zoning, design, and subdivision standards, the town shall not conduct more than
five public hearings (including continuances), workshops, study sessions, or
similar meetings after the full application is deemed complete in connection
with the approval of the housing development. This limitation is established by
Cal. Gov't. Code § 65905.5. Meetings required by CEQA are exempt from the
limit.
(Ord. 885, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 17.027.080 FINDINGS AND DECISION.
   (A)   If the proposed housing development complies with applicable objective
general plan, zoning, design and subdivision standards, the Planning Commission
may only deny the housing development or conditionally approve the housing
development at a lower density if it makes written findings supported by a
preponderance of the evidence in the record that:
      (1)   The housing development would have a specific, adverse impact upon
the public health or safety unless the housing development is denied or
conditionally approved at a lower density. A “specific, adverse impact” means a
“significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on identified
written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they
existed on the date that the project was deemed complete”; and
      (2)   There is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the
adverse impact other than the denial of the housing development or conditional
approval of the housing development at a lower density.
   (B)   If the housing development includes 20 percent of units affordable to
very low or low-income households, 100 percent of units affordable or
moderate- or middle-income households, or an emergency shelter, the Planning
Commission shall approve the housing development unless the Commission makes
written findings supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record, as
to at least one of the findings in Cal. Gov't. Code § 65589.5(d).
   (C)   The Planning Director shall approve or deny the housing development
within the applicable time periods established in Cal. Gov't. Code § 65950 and
related sections.

§ 17.044.100 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW PROCEDURES FOR WAIVERS.
   The Planning Director shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny
applications for waivers based on the standards and limitations of the
requirements of this chapter and the following procedures.
   (A)   An application for a waiver shall be filed and processed on a form
provided by planning staff accompanied by the required fee. In addition to any
other application requirements, the application for a waiver shall include data
or other evidence explaining why the findings necessary to grant the waiver,
set forth below, are satisfied.
   (B)   An application for a waiver based on a request for a reasonable
accommodation to ensure access to housing may include a request to exceed the
limits in §
17.044.090. The Planning Director shall issue a written decision within 45 days
of the date the application for a reasonable accommodation is deemed complete,
and may grant the reasonable accommodation request, grant with modifications,
or deny the request. All written decisions shall give notice of the right to
appeal and to request reasonable accommodation in the appeals process.
   (C)   If a request for waiver is being submitted in conjunction with an
application for another approval, permit, or entitlement under this title, it
shall be heard and acted upon at the same time and in the same manner as that
application.
   (D)   A decision to grant a waiver shall be based on the following findings:
      (1)   The waiver is necessary due to the physical characteristics of the
property and the proposed use or structure or other circumstances, including,
but not limited to, topography, noise exposure, irregular property boundaries,
or other unusual circumstance;
      (2)   There are no alternatives to the requested waiver that could
provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant with less potential
detriment to surrounding owners and occupants or to the general public;
      (3)   The granting of the requested waiver will not be detrimental to the
health or safety of the public or the occupants of the property or result in a
change in land use or density that would be inconsistent with the requirements
of this title; and
      (4)   If the waiver requested is to provide reasonable accommodation
pursuant to state or federal law, the Planning Director shall also make one or
more of the following findings in addition to any other findings that this
title requires:
         (a)   That the housing or other property that is the subject of the
request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an individual or
organization entitled to protection;
         (b)   If the request for accommodation is to provide fair access to
housing, that the request for accommodation is necessary to make specific
housing available to an individual protected under State or federal law;
         (c)   That the conditions imposed, if any, are necessary to further a
compelling public interest and represent the least restrictive means of
furthering that interest; and
         (d)   That denial of the requested waiver would impose a substantial
burden on religious exercise or would conflict with any State or federal
statute requiring reasonable accommodation to provide access to housing.
   (E)   The Planning Director has the authority to impose reasonable
conditions that are related and proportionate to what is being requested by the
applicant, as deemed necessary and appropriate to ensure that the provisions of
the General Plan, any applicable master plan or precise plan, and this title
are met. The Planning Director may require reasonable guarantees and evidence
that such conditions are being, or will be, complied with. Waivers approved
based on state or federal requirements for reasonable accommodation may be
conditioned to provide for rescission or automatic expiration based on a change
of occupancy or other relevant change in circumstance.

the existing multifamily dwelling has a rear or side yard setback of less than
four feet, the town will not require any modification to the multifamily
dwelling as a condition of approving the ADU.
            2.   The peak height above grade does not exceed the applicable
height limit provided in division (E)(2)(a) through (c) below.
            3.   If the lot has an existing multifamily dwelling, the quantity

processing fee. Application processing fees and building permit fees for ADUs
and JADUs, as applicable, will be reduced by 50% as part of an incentive
program to encourage residents to legalize or create accessory dwelling units.
In addition to the foregoing, while the incentive program remains in effect,
any property with a non-permitted ADU or JADU that is legalized pursuant to
this section will not be assessed a financial penalty for failing to obtain a
permit required by this section. This incentive program expires on January 1,
2032.
      (3)   Process and timing.
         (a)   An ADU permit is considered and approved ministerially, without
discretionary review or hearing.
         (b)   The town must approve or deny an application to create an ADU or
JADU within 60 days from the date that the town receives a completed
application. If the town has not approved or denied the completed application
within 60 days, the application is deemed approved unless either:
            1.   The applicant requests a delay, in which case the 60-day time
period is tolled for the period of the requested delay, or
            2.   When an application to create an ADU or JADU is submitted with
a permit application to create a new single-family or multifamily dwelling on
the lot, the town may delay acting on the permit application for the ADU or
JADU until the town acts on the permit application to create the new single-
family or multifamily dwelling, but the application to create the ADU or JADU
will still be considered ministerially without discretionary review or a
hearing.
         (c)   If the town denies an application to create an ADU or JADU, the
town must provide the applicant with comments that include, among other things,
a list of all the defective or deficient items and a description of how the
application may be remedied by the applicant. Notice of the denial and
corresponding comments must be provided to the applicant within the 60-day time
period established by division (D)(3)(a) above.
         (d)   A demolition permit for a detached garage that is to be replaced
with an ADU is reviewed with the application for the ADU and issued at the same
time.
   (E)   General ADU and JADU requirements. The following requirements apply to
all ADUs and JADUs that are approved under divisions (D)(1) or (D)(2) above:
      (1)   Zoning.
         (a)   ADUs are permitted in the zoning districts and overlay zones
listed below that allow residential use, and must be accessory to a permitted
residential use.
            1.   RS-7.5 Single-family Residential Zone, Medium Density.

            3.   RD 5.5-7 Residential Zone, High Density.
            4.   RM Multiple-family Residential Zone.
            5.   RM-S Multiple-family Residential Senior Residential Zone.
            6.   CL Limited Commercial Zone.

         (b)   In accordance with Gov’t Code § 66333(a), a JADU may only be
created on a lot zoned for single-family residences.
      (2)   Height.
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided by division (E)(2)(b) and (E)(2)(c)
below, a detached ADU created on a lot with an existing or proposed single
family or multifamily dwelling unit may not exceed 16 feet in height.
         (b)   A detached ADU may be up to 18 feet in height if it is created
on a lot with an existing or proposed single family or multifamily dwelling
unit that is located within one-half mile walking distance of a major transit
stop or high quality transit corridor, as those terms are defined in § 21155 of
the Cal. Public Resources Code, and the ADU may be up to two additional feet in
height (for a maximum of 20 feet) if necessary to accommodate a roof pitch on
the ADU that is aligned with the roof pitch of the primary dwelling unit.
         (c)   A detached ADU created on a lot with an existing or proposed
multifamily dwelling that has more than one story above grade may not exceed 18
feet in height.
         (d)   An ADU that is attached to the primary dwelling may not exceed
25 feet in height or the height limitation imposed by the underlying zone that
applies to the primary dwelling, whichever is lower.
         (e)   Notwithstanding divisions(E)(2)(a) though (d) above, ADUs may
not exceed two stories.
         (f)   For purposes of this division (E)(2), height is measured from
existing legal grade or the level of the lowest floor, whichever is lower, to
the peak of the structure.
      (3)   Fire sprinklers.
         (a)   Fire sprinklers are required in an ADU if sprinklers are
required in the primary residence and may be required by the Fire Department.
         (b)   The construction of an ADU does not trigger a requirement for
fire sprinklers to be installed in the existing primary dwelling.
      (4)   Rental term. No ADU or JADU may be rented for a term that is
shorter than 31 days. An ADU/JADU constructed prior to January 1, 2020 with a
building permit issued for the construction of the ADU/JADU is not subject to
this rental term.
      (5)   No separate conveyance. An ADU or JADU may be rented, but, except
as otherwise provided in Gov’t Code § 66341, no ADU or JADU may be sold or
otherwise conveyed separately from the lot and the primary dwelling (in the
case of a single-family lot) or from the lot and all of the dwellings (in the
case of a multifamily lot).
      (6)   Septic system. If the ADU or JADU will connect to an onsite
wastewater- treatment system, the owner must include with the application
demonstration of compliance with applicable County of Marin Environmental
Health Services requirements for onsite wastewater treatment.
      (7)   Owner occupancy.
         (a)   ADUs created under this section on or after January 1, 2020 are
not subject to an owner-occupancy requirement.
         (b)   As required by state law, all JADUs are subject to an owner-
occupancy requirement. A natural person with legal or equitable title to the
property must reside on the property, in either the primary dwelling or JADU,
as the person's legal domicile and permanent residence. However, the owner-
occupancy requirement in this division (E)(7)(a) does not apply if the property
is entirely owned by another governmental agency, land trust, or housing
organization.
      (8)   Deed restriction. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy
for a JADU, a deed restriction must be recorded against the title of the
property in the County Recorder's office and a copy filed with the Director.
The deed restriction must run with the land and bind all future owners. The
form of the deed restriction will be provided by the town and must provide
that:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in Gov’t Code § 66341, the JADU may
not be sold separately from the primary dwelling.
         (b)   The JADU is restricted to the approved size and to other
attributes allowed by this section.
         (c)   The deed restriction runs with the land and may be enforced
against future property owners.
         (d)   The deed restriction may be removed if the owner eliminates
JADU, as evidenced by, for example, removal of the kitchen facilities. To
remove the deed restriction, an owner may make a written request of the
Director, providing evidence that the JADU has in fact been eliminated. The
Director may then determine whether the evidence supports the claim that the
JADU has been eliminated. Appeal may be taken from the Director's determination
consistent with other provisions of this code. If the JADU is not entirely
physically removed, but is only eliminated by virtue of having a necessary
component of a JADU removed, the remaining structure and improvements must
otherwise comply with applicable provisions of this code.
         (e)   The deed restriction is enforceable by the director or his or
her designee for the benefit of the town. Failure of the property owner to
comply with the deed restriction may result in legal action against the
property owner, and the town is authorized to obtain any remedy available to it
at law or equity, including, but not limited to, obtaining an injunction
enjoining the use of the JADU in violation of the recorded restrictions or
abatement of the illegal unit.
      (9)   Rent reporting. In order to facilitate the city's obligation to
identify adequate sites for housing in accordance with Gov’t Code §§ 65583.1
and 66330, the following requirements must be satisfied:
         (a)   With the building- permit application, the applicant must
provide the town with an estimate of the projected annualized rent that will be
charged for the ADU or JADU.
         (b)   Within 90 days after each January 1 following issuance of the
building permit, the owner must report the actual rent charged for the ADU or
JADU during the prior year. If the town does not receive the report within the
90-day period, the owner is in violation of this code, and the town may send
the owner a notice of violation and allow the owner another 30 days to submit
the report. If the owner fails to submit the report within the 30-day period,
the town may enforce this provision in accordance with the provisions in
Chapter 1.10.
         (c)   The rent reporting data will not be connected to the street
address and will be reported anonymously to protect confidentiality.
      (10)   Building and safety.
         (a)   Must comply with building code. All ADUs and JADUs must comply
with all local building code requirements.
         (b)   No change of occupancy. Construction of an ADU does not
constitute a Group R occupancy change under the local building code, as
described in § 310 of the Cal. Building Code, unless the building official or
code enforcement officer makes a written finding based on substantial evidence
in the record that the construction of the ADU could have a specific, adverse
impact on public health and safety. Nothing in division (E)(10(a) prevents the
town from changing the occupancy code of a space that was uninhabitable space
or that was only permitted for nonresidential use and was subsequently
converted for residential use in accordance with this section.
      (11)   Setbacks. No setback is required for an ADU that is constructed in
the same location and to the same dimensions as an existing structure.
   (F)   Specific ADU requirements. The following requirements apply only to
ADUs that require an ADU permit underdivision (D)(2) above.
      (1)   Maximum size.
         (a)   The maximum size of a detached or attached ADU subject to this
division (F) is 850 square feet for a studio or one-bedroom unit and 1,200

         (b)   An attached ADU that is created on a lot with an existing
primary dwelling is further limited to 50% of the floor area of the existing
primary dwelling.
         (c)   Application of other development standards in this division (F),
such as FAR or lot coverage, might further limit the size of the ADU, but no
application of the percent-based size limit, FAR, front setback, lot coverage
limit, or open-space requirement may require the ADU to be less than 850 square
feet for a one-bedroom unit or 1,200 square feet for a two- bedroom unit.
      (2)   Floor area ratio (FAR). No ADU subject to this division (F) may
cause the total FAR of the lot to exceed 40 percent, subject to divisions (F)
(1)(b) and (F)(1)(c) above.
      (3)   Setbacks. ADUs that are subject to this division (F) must conform
to four-foot side and rear setbacks. AD Us that are subject to this division
(F) must conform to ten-foot front setbacks, subject to divisions (F)(1)(b) and
(F)(1)(c) above.
      (4)   Lot coverage. No ADU subject to this division (F) may cause the
total lot coverage of the lot to exceed 35%, subject to division (F)(1)(b).
      (5)   Minimum open space. No ADU subject to division (F) may cause the
total percentage of open space of the lot to fall below 50%, subject to
division (F)(1)(b) above.
      (6)   Minimum open space (usable). No ADU on a lot subject to this
division (F) may cause the open space area to fall below 300 square feet per
unit. Open space area shall not include any required yard or setback, required
building separation, access area, or area with dimensions of less than ten feet
or slope of greater than 10%, subject to division (F)(1)(c) above.
      (7)   Passageway. No passageway, as defined by division (C) above is
required for an ADU.
      (8)   Parking.
         (a)   Generally.One off-street parking space is required for each ADU.
The parking space may be provided in setback areas or as tandem parking, as
defined by division (C) above.
         (b)   Exceptions. No parking under division (F) is required in the
following situations:
            1.   The ADU is located within one-half mile walking distance of
public transit, as defined in division (C) above.
            2.   The ADU is located within an architecturally and historically
significant historic district.
            3.   The ADU is part of the proposed or existing primary residence
or an accessory structure under division (F)(1) above.
            4.   When on-street parking permits are required but not offered to
the occupant of the ADU.
            5.   When there is an established car share vehicle stop located
within one block of the ADU.
            6.   When the permit application to create an ADU is submitted with
an application to create a new single-family or new multifamily dwelling on the
same lot, provided that the ADU or the lot satisfies any other criteria listed
in division (F)(8)(b)1. through 5. above.
         (c)   No replacement. When a garage, carport, covered parking
structure, or uncovered parking space is demolished in conjunction with the
construction of an ADU or converted to an ADU, those off-street parking spaces
are not required to be replaced.
      (9)   Stream buffer. No ADU shall be constructed closer to the top of the
stream bank of the Fairfax and San Anselmo Creeks than 20 feet or two times the
average depth of the creek bank, whichever is greater.
      (9)   Architectural requirements.
         (a)   The materials and colors of the exterior walls, roof, windows
and doors of an ADU addition to a primary dwelling must appear similar to those
of the primary dwelling.
         (b)   The materials and colors of the exterior walls, roof, windows
and doors of a second detached ADU must appear similar to either those of the
primary dwelling or those of the other detached ADU on the property.
         (c)   The roof slope must appear similar to that of the dominant roof
slope of the primary dwelling. The dominant roof slope is the slope shared by
the largest portion of the roof.
         (d)   The exterior lighting must be dark sky compliant (fully shielded
and emit no light above the horizontal plane with no sag or drop lenses, side
light panels or uplight panels) as well as compliant with color temperature to
minimize blue rich lighting. The lighting shall not emit direct offsite
illumination and shall be the minimum necessary for safety.
         (e)   The ADU must have an independent exterior entrance, apart from
that of the primary dwelling.
         (f)   The interior horizontal dimensions of an ADU must be at least
ten feet wide in every direction, with a minimum interior wall height of seven
feet.
      (11)   Historical protections. An ADU that is on or within 600 feet of
real property that is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources
is subject to objective development requirements of the State Historical
Building Code.
      (12)   Allowed stories. No ADU subject to this division (F) may have more
than one story, except that an ADU that is attached to the primary dwelling may
have the stories allowed under division (E)(2)(d).   (G)   Fees. The following
requirements apply to all ADUs that are approved under divisions (D)(1) or (D)
(2) above.
      (1)   Impact fees.
         (a)   No impact fee is required for an ADU that is less than 750
square feet in size. For purposes of this division, “impact fee” means a “fee”
under the Mitigation Fee Act (Gov’t Code § 66000(b)) and a fee under the Quimby
Act (Gov’t Code § 66477). “Impact fee” here does not include any connection fee
or capacity charge for water or sewer service.
         (b)   Any impact fee that is required for an ADU that is 750 square
feet or larger in size must be charged proportionately in relation to the
square footage of the primary dwelling unit. (e.g., the floor area of the ADU,
divided by the floor area of the primary dwelling, times the typical fee amount
charged for a new dwelling.)
      (2)   Utility fees.
         (a)   If an ADU is constructed with a new single-family home, a
separate utility connection directly between the ADU and the utility and
payment of the normal connection fee and capacity charge for a new dwelling are
required.
         (b)   Converted ADUs on a single-family lot that are created under
division (D)(1) above are not required to have a new or separate utility
connection directly between the ADU and the utility. Nor is a connection fee or
capacity charge required.
         (c)   All ADUs that are not covered by division (G)(2)(a) require a
new, separate utility connection directly between the ADU and the utility for
any utility. All utilities are subject to the connection and fee requirements
of the utility provider.
            1.   The connection is subject to a connection fee or capacity
charge that is proportionate to the burden created by the ADU based on either
the floor area or the number of drainage-fixture units (DFU) values, as defined
by the Uniform Plumbing Code, upon the water or sewer system.
            2.   The portion of the fee or charge that is charged by the town
may not exceed the reasonable cost of providing this service.
   (H)   Nonconforming Zoning Code Conditions, Building Code Violations, and
Unpermitted Structures.
      (1)   Generally. The town will not deny an ADU or JADU application due to
a nonconforming zoning condition, building code violation, or unpermitted
structure on the lot that does not present a threat to the public health and
safety and that is not affected by the construction of the ADU or JADU.
      (2)   Unpermitted ADUs constructed before 2020.
         (a)   Permit to legalize. As required by state law, the town may not
deny a permit to legalize an existing but unpermitted ADU or JADU that was
constructed before January 1, 2020, if denial is based on either of the
following grounds:
            1.   The ADU violates applicable building standards; or
            2.   The ADU or JADU does not comply with state ADU or JADU law or
this
ADU chapter.
         (b)   Exceptions.
            1.    Notwithstanding division (H)(2) above, the town may deny a
permit to legalize an existing but unpermitted ADU or JADU that was constructed
before January 1, 2020, if the town makes a finding that correcting a violation
is necessary to comply with the standards specified in Cal. Health and Safety
Code § 17920.3.
            2.   Division (H)(2) above does not apply to a building that is
deemed to be substandard in accordance with Cal. Health and Safety Code §
17920.3.
   (I)   Nonconforming ADUs and discretionary approval.Any proposed ADU or JADU
that would otherwise be allowed under this section but that does not conform to
the objective design or development standards set forth in divisions (A)
through (G)(2)(c)2. of this section may be allowed by the town with a variance
and/or conditional use permit or waiver, as applicable in accordance with the
other provisions of this title.

      (6)   Unit standards.
         (a)   Quantity.
            1.   No more than two dwelling units of any kind may be built on a
lot that results from an urban lot split. For purposes of this paragraph,
"unit" means any dwelling unit, including, but not limited to, a primary
dwelling unit, a unit created under this chapter (
Chapter 17.049), an accessory dwelling unit, or a junior accessory dwelling
unit (
Chapter 17.048).
            2.   A lot that is not created by an urban lot split may have a
two-unit project under this section, plus any accessory dwelling unit or junior
accessory dwelling unit that shall be allowed under state law and the town's
accessory dwelling unit ordinance.

            1.   The total floor area of each primary dwelling built that is
developed under this section shall be
               a.   less than or equal to 800 and
               b.   more than 500 square feet.
            2.   A primary dwelling that was legally established on the lot
prior to the two-unit project and that is larger than 800 square feet is
limited to the lawful floor area at the time of the two-unit project. The unit
may not be expanded.
            3.   A primary dwelling that was legally established prior to the
two-unit project and that is smaller than 800 square feet may be expanded to
800 square feet after or as part of the two-unit project.
         (c)   Height restrictions.
            1.   On a lot that is larger than 2,000 square feet, no new primary
dwelling unit may exceed a single story or 16 feet in height, measured from
grade to peak of the structure.
            2.   On a lot that is smaller than 2,000 square feet, no new
primary dwelling unit may exceed two stories or 22 feet in height, measured
from grade to peak of the structure. Any portion of a new primary dwelling that
exceeds one story shall be stepped back by an additional five feet from the
ground floor; no balcony deck or other portion of the second story may project
into the stepback.
            3.   No rooftop deck is permitted on any new or remodeled dwelling
or structure on a lot with a two-unit project.
         (d)   Demo cap. The two-unit project may not involve the demolition of
more than 25 percent of the existing exterior walls of an existing dwelling
unless the site has not been occupied by a tenant in the last three years.
         (e)   Lot coverage. The total lot coverage shall not exceed 35 percent
of the lot. This lot coverage standard is only enforced to the extent that it
does not prevent two primary dwelling units on the lot at 800 square feet each.
         (f)   Open space. No dwelling unit on a resulting lot subject to
division (E)(6)(d) may cause the open space area to fall below 300 square feet
per unit. "Open space area" shall not include any required yard or setback,
required building separation, access area, or area with dimensions of less than
ten feet or slope of greater than ten percent, subject to division (E)(6)(d)
above open space standard is only enforced to the extent that it does not
prevent two primary dwelling units on the lot at 800 square feet each.
         (g)   Setbacks.
            1.   Generally. All setbacks shall conform to those objective
setbacks that are imposed through the underlying zone.
            2.   Exceptions. Notwithstanding division (E)(6)(g) above:
               a.    Existing structures. No setback is required for an
existing legally established structure or for a new structure that is
constructed in the same location and to the same dimensions as an existing
legally established structure.
               b.   The setbacks imposed by the underlying zone shall yield to
the degree necessary to avoid physically precluding the construction of up to
two units on the lot or either of the two units from being at least 800 square
feet in floor area; but in no event may any structure be less than four feet
from a side or rear property line.
            3.   Front setback area. Notwithstanding any other part of this

the morning and afternoon peak commute periods.
            2.   The site is located within one block of a permanently
designated car-share vehicle location.
         (i)   Architecture.
            1.   If there is a legal primary dwelling on the lot that was
established before the two-unit project, any new primary dwelling unit shall
match the existing primary dwelling unit in exterior materials, color, and
dominant roof pitch. The dominant roof slope is the slope shared by the largest
portion of the roof.
            2.   If there is no legal primary dwelling on the lot before the
two-unit project, and if two primary dwellings are developed on the lot, the
dwellings shall match each other in exterior materials, color, and dominant
roof pitch. The dominant roof slope is the slope shared by the largest portion
of the roof.
            3.   All exterior lighting shall be downward directed, shielded to
prevent direct offsite illumination, the minimum number of fixtures necessary
to provide pathway, stair/step, and entry illumination, and a maximum of two
foot candles lighting intensity. No landscape lighting is allowed.
            4.   No window or door of a dwelling that is constructed on the lot
may have a direct line of sight to an adjoining residential property. Fencing,
landscaping, or privacy glass may be used to provide screening and prevent a
direct line of sight.
            5.   If any portion of a dwelling is less than 30 feet from a
property line that is not a public right-of-way line, then all windows and
doors in that portion shall either be (for windows) with the bottom of the
glass at least six feet above the finished floor, or (for windows and for
doors) utilize frosted or obscure glass.
         (j)   Landscaping.
            1.   Evergreen landscape screening shall be planted and maintained
between each dwelling and adjacent lots (but not rights of way) as follows:
               a.   At least one 15-gallon size plant shall be provided for
every five linear feet of exterior wall.
               b.   Plant specimens must be at least six feet tall when

               d.   No undesirable tree species as defined by §
8.36.020 shall be planted.
               e.   Any heritage tree, as defined by §
8.36.020, removed shall require two 36" box trees FireSafe Marin Fire-Smart
Plant list to be planted prior to final approval.
         (k)   Nonconforming conditions. An existing legal nonconformity shall
not require any correction prior to approval of a two-unit project.
         (l)   Utilities.
            1.   Each primary dwelling unit on the lot shall have its own
direct utility connection to the utility service provider.
            2.    Notwithstanding division (E)(10)(l)1. above, a primary
dwelling unit may have a direct utility connection to an onsite wastewater
treatment system in accordance with this paragraph and the town's code. Each
primary dwelling unit on the resulting lots that is or that is proposed to be
connected to an onsite wastewater treatment system shall comply with current
county wastewater treatment system requirements for new parcels.
         (m)   Building and safety. All structures built on the lot shall
comply with all current local building standards. A project under this section
is a change of use and subjects the whole of the lot, and all structures, to
the town's current code.
      (7)   Fire-hazard mitigation measures.
         (a)   A lot shall comply with each of the following fire-hazard
mitigation measures:
            1.   All enclosed structures on the site shall have fire
sprinklers.

foot hose-pull distance from either the public right of way or of an onsite
fire hydrant or standpipe.
            4.   A lot shall have direct access to a public right of way with a
paved street with a minimum width consisting of a net horizontal unobstructed
clearance of not less than 20 feet exclusive of gutters, curbs, and shoulders,
that connects to a designated evacuation route.
         (b)   Prior to submitting an application for an urban lot split, the
applicant shall obtain a certificate of compliance with all applicable fire-
hazard mitigation measures in accordance with this division (E)(11). The town
or its authorized agent shall inspect the site, including all structures on the
site, and certify as to its compliance. The certificate shall be included with
the application. The applicant shall pay the town's costs for inspection.
Failure to pay is grounds for denying the application.
      (8)   Separate conveyance.
         (a)   Primary dwelling units on the lot may not be owned or conveyed
separately from each other.
         (b)   Common interest developments, as defined by Cal. Civil Code §
4100, are not permitted within the lot.
         (c)   All fee interest in the lot and all the dwellings shall be held

occupy one of the dwellings on the lot as the owners' principal residence and
legal domicile.
      (10)   Notice of construction.
         (a)   At least 30 business days before starting any construction of a
two-unit project, the property owner shall give written notice to all the
owners of record of each of the adjacent residential parcels, which notice
shall include the following information:
            1.   Notice that construction has been authorized,
            2.   The anticipated start and end dates for construction,
            3.   The hours of construction,
            4.   Contact information for the project manager (for construction-
related complaints), and
            5.   Contact information for the Department of Planning and
Building Services.
         (b)   This notice requirement does not confer a right on the noticed
persons or on anyone else to comment on the project before permits are issued.
Approval is ministerial. Under state law, the town has no discretion in
approving or denying a particular project under this section. This notice
requirement is purely to promote neighborhood awareness and expectation.
      (11)   Deed restriction. The owner shall record a deed restriction on
each lot that results from the urban lot split, on a form approved by the town,
that does each of the following:
         (a)   Expressly prohibits any rental of any dwelling on the property
for a period of less than 30 days.
         (b)   Expressly prohibits any non-residential use of the lot.

            1.   If the lot is not created by an urban lot split: Expressly
requires the individual property owners to live in one of the dwelling units on
the lot as the owners' primary residence and legal domicile; or
            2.   If the property is formed by an urban lot split, it is
therefore subject to the town's urban lot split regulations, including all
applicable limits on dwelling size and development.
   (F)   Specific adverse impacts.
      (1)   Notwithstanding anything else in this section, the town may deny an
application for a two-unit project if the Building Official makes a written
finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the project would have
a "specific, adverse impact" on either public health and safety or on the
physical environment and for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
      (2)   "Specific adverse impact" has the same meaning as in Cal. Gov’t
Code § 65589.5(d)(2): "a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable
impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety
standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application
was deemed complete" and does not include (1) inconsistency with the zoning
ordinance or general plan land use designation or (2) the eligibility to claim
a welfare exemption under Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code § 214(g).
      (3)   The Building Official may consult with and be assisted by planning
staff and others as necessary in making a finding of specific, adverse impact.
   (G)   Remedies. If a two-unit project violates any part of this code or any
other legal requirement:
      (1)   The buyer, grantee, or lessee of any part of the property has an
action for damages or to void the deed, sale, or contract.
      (2)   The town may:
         (a)   Bring an action to enjoin any attempt to sell, lease, or finance
the property.
         (b)   Bring an action for other legal, equitable, or summary remedy,
such as declaratory and injunctive relief.
         (c)   Pursue criminal prosecution, punishable by imprisonment in
county jail or state prison for up to one year, by a fine of up to $10,000, or
both; or a misdemeanor.
         (d)   Record a notice of violation.
         (e)   Withhold any or all future permits and approvals.
         (f)   Pursue all other administrative, legal, or equitable remedies
that are allowed by law or the town's code.

at a prescribed density by the general plan land use designation and/or zoning
district. Where the density allowed under the zoning district is inconsistent
with the density allowed under the General Plan, the General Plan site
designation density shall prevail.
   (B)   When an applicant seeks a density bonus, incentive, or concession for
a housing development, the town will comply with the requirements in the State
Density Bonus Law, follow the procedures for calculating the allowable density
bonus using the procedures in the State Density Bonus Law, and grant a density
bonus, concessions, and incentives in accord with the State Density Bonus Law.
   (C)   No affordable housing impact fee, including any inclusionary fees and
in-lieu fees that may be adopted by the town, shall be imposed on the
affordable units approved under the housing development density bonus program
established by this chapter.
(Ord. 885, passed 11-1-2023)
§ 17.050.050 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS; REVIEW AND APPROVAL.
   (A)   A developer seeking a state density bonus, incentive or concession,
waiver or modification of a development standard, or a revised parking
standard, shall submit an application for approval of a housing development
with a density bonus. This application shall be processed concurrently with all
other applications required for the housing development. The application shall
be submitted on a form prescribed by the Planning Director and the application
shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
      (1)   A site plan showing the total number and location of all proposed
housing units and the number and location of proposed housing units which
qualify the housing development for density bonus housing units;
      (2)   The manner in which the applicant shall satisfy the affordability
requirements for the housing units that qualify the housing development for
density bonus units;
      (3)   A description of any requested incentives and concessions, waivers
or modification of development standards, or modified parking standards;
      (4)   For all incentives and concessions, except mixed use development,
the application shall include evidence deemed sufficient by the Planning
Director to demonstrate that the requested incentives and concessions result in
identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. The Planning
Director may require that an independent financial review be conducted at the
expense of the applicant.
      (5)   For waivers or modifications of development standards, the
application shall include evidence deemed sufficient by the Planning Director
to demonstrate that the requested waivers or modifications are necessary to
make the housing units economically feasible and that the development standard
from which a waiver or modification is requested will have the effect of
precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities to
which the applicant is entitled pursuant to this chapter.
      (6)   If the application is requested for a project that will include
housing units for extremely low income households, the applicant shall be
entitled to a density bonus that is 50 percent greater than the bonus that
would be granted if these units were for very low income households.
      (7)   If a density bonus is requested for a land donation, the
application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide
evidence that each of the conditions pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code §§ 65915(g)(2)
(A through H) are met.
      (8)   If a density bonus or incentive or concession is requested for a
child care facility pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(h), the application
shall show the location and square footage of the child care facility and
provide evidence that the community lacks adequate child care facilities.
      (9)   A written acknowledgement that the project will be subject to a
condition of approval and deed restriction to retain affordability of the
affordable unit(s) for at least 55 years.
      (10)   If the density bonus is requested for a proposed housing
development that would result in the removal or conversion of existing rental
dwelling units, or if the property upon which the housing development is
proposed has within the past five years been occupied by rental dwelling units,
the application shall include the following:
         (a)   A description of the housing units removed, converted, proposed
to be removed or proposed to be converted;
         (b)   The income levels of the persons occupying each unit removed,
converted, proposed to be removed or proposed to be converted;
         (c)   The rental rates charged for the immediately preceding five
years for each unit removed, converted, proposed to be removed or proposed to
be converted.
      (11)   Payment of fees set forth in a resolution adopted by the Town
Council.
   (B)   An application for a density bonus, incentive or concession, waiver or
modification of a development standard, or revised parking standard shall be
considered and acted upon by the Planning Commission based on its permit review
authority for the housing development.
   (C)   Before approving an application for a density bonus, incentive or
concession, or waiver or modification of a development standard, the Planning
Commission shall make the following findings:
      (1)   If the density bonus is based all or in part on a donation of land,
the conditions of Cal. Gov't Code § 65915 (g)(2)(A through H) are met.
      (2)   If the density bonus, incentive or concession is based all or in
part on the inclusion of a child care facility, that the conditions included in
Cal. Gov't Code § 65915 (h)(2)(A) and (B) are met.
      (3)   If the incentive or concession includes mixed use development, the
findings included in Cal. Gov't Code § 65915 (k)(2) are met.
      (4)   If a waiver or modification of a development standard is requested,
the developer has demonstrated, for each requested waiver or modification, that
the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically
feasible and that the development standards from which a waiver or modification
is requested will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing
development at the densities to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to
this chapter or with the concessions and incentives permitted by this chapter.
   (D)   The Planning Commission may deny a concession or incentive if it makes
a written finding based upon substantial evidence of either of the following:
      (1)   The concession or incentive does not result in identifiable and
actual cost reductions to provide for affordable rents or affordable housing
costs as required by this chapter.
      (2)   The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact
upon public health or safety or the physical environment or on any real
property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and there
is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse
impact without rendering the development unaffordable to lower, very low-, or
moderate income households. For purposes of this subsection, “specific adverse
impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based
on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies,
or conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed
complete.
   (E)   The Planning Commission may deny a waiver or modification of a
development standard only if it makes a written finding based upon substantial
evidence of either of the following:
      (1)   The waiver or modification would have a specific adverse impact
upon health, safety or the physical environment and there is no feasible method
to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without
rendering the housing development unaffordable to lower, very low- or moderate
income households. For purposes of this subsection, “specific adverse impact”
means a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on
objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or
conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed
complete.
      (2)   The waiver or modification would have an adverse impact on any real
property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.
   (F)   If a density bonus or concession or incentive is based on the
provision of childcare facilities, the Planning Commission may deny the density
bonus or concession or incentive if it finds, based on substantial evidence,
that the town already has adequate childcare facilities.

§ 17.056.110 REQUIRED FINDINGS.
   To approve the traffic impact permit, the Planning Commission and Town
Council must make one of the following findings.
   (A)   The project’s average daily traffic, when added to the existing daily
traffic, plus projected traffic, will not cause the performance of intersection
of roadway linkages to fall below the acceptable level of service or otherwise
further reduce the system performance if it is already below the acceptable
level of service; nor will it cause a significant degradation in service levels
for impacted intersections at their peak traffic periods.
   (B)   (1)   The traffic impact mitigation plan approved by the Planning
Commission and Town Council will adequately mitigate the project’s adverse
traffic impacts.
      (2)   This plan is consistent with the goals and objectives of the
Fairfax general plan or applicable specific plans and the intent of the zoning
district in which the project is situated, and of this chapter.
   (C)   The project’s average daily traffic will not increase the traffic
volume on any roadway segments or intersection approaches of the town’s
principal circulation system by more than one percent or by more than 100
vehicles, whichever is less.
   (D)   The project will provide an overriding public benefit that will
sufficiently offset its adverse traffic impacts. Any affirmative decision of
the Planning Commission or the Town Council based upon this finding must be
approved by a five-sevenths majority of the Planning Commission and a four-
fifths majority of the Town Council. The grounds for making this finding must
be set forth in the approving motion.
   (E)   The traffic impact mitigation plan approved by the Planning Commission
and Town Council will adequately mitigate the project's adverse traffic impacts
but no transportation impact fee or in-lieu fee for traffic impact mitigation
will be levied because the project will provide affordable housing for lower
income households, either through the town’s density bonus program or with a
minimum of ten percent of the units reserved for lower income households, and
only physical improvements directly related to access to the project site for
vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians and reasonable off-site improvements needed
to mitigate impacts on the town’s street systems, such as intersection designs,
signalization, turn or deceleration lanes and the like (e.g., bike path systems
and the like) and maintain acceptable levels of service shall be required to
offset identified traffic impacts. A deed restriction shall be recorded against
the property that runs with the land for 55 years to ensure affordability for
lower income units that is approved by the Town Attorney and Town Council shall
be required as a condition of approval of a traffic impact permit.

    The purpose of this chapter is to implement the General Plan’s policies for
open space and resource conservation by establishing objective review criteria
for land use applications, in order to conserve the existing scenic resources
and protect the sense of community and/or neighborhood identity now afforded by
the presence of the unurbanized open spaces on the ridge tops above the town by
preserving them in an open and scenically attractive state.

Resources augmented by additional topographic reference mapping by town staff.
   RIDGELINE. The uppermost line in elevation traversing a major ridge (chain
of hills).
   RIDGELINE SCENIC CORRIDORS. Those areas defined as community and/or
neighborhood separators and visual resources providing community and/or
neighborhood identity, further defined as the area on either side of the
ridgeline within 150 feet horizontal distance measured at right angles to the
ridgeline or 100 feet vertically of the major ridge, whichever is a greater
area as located on General Plan Figure OS-1 Map of Visual Resources.
   SCENIC HIGHWAYS. Those roadways depicted on the General Plan Figure OS-I Map
of Visual Resource as Scenic Highways, including Bolinas Road and Sir Francis
Drake Boulevard.
   SIGNIFICANT VIEW CORRIDORS. Identified by the Planning Commission as places
from which the visual impact of development in a ridgeline scenic corridor
could be significant and contrary to the purposes of this title.
   UTILITY LINES. Public or private utility distribution and transmission
lines.
(Prior Code, § 17.32.020) (Ord. 352, passed - -1973; Am. Ord. 476, passed - -

§ 17.060.050 CRITERIA FOR REVIEW OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall use the following criteria to review
applications.
   (B)   These criteria must be complied with unless an exception is granted by
the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Native planting shall be retained to provide screening and avoid
abrupt changes in the natural, vegetative cover. Tree pruning and tree removal
around structures may be allowed if needed to reduce fire hazards, accommodate
low impact clustered residential development consistent with the standards of §
17.072.090 (H), and ensure emergency ingress and egress. A tree plan, including
revegetation requirements and proposed locations of trees of approved suitable
species, may be required pursuant to §
16.24.070.
      (2)   Additional screening and cover shall be provided, with new planting
utilizing native species compatible with existing vegetation and designed to
break up silhouettes, reflections and large, unnatural surfaces. If required as
a condition of design review approval, a maintenance bond shall be posted for
one year to ensure the vitality of essential landscaping.
      (3)   Buildings, fences and structures shall be of materials and colors
compatible consistent with materials and colors in the surrounding area within
300 feet of the project site. Exterior paint colors shall be muted earth tones,
consistent with a color palette of paint colors based on Pantone color
standards, which have been approved by the Planning Commission. Other colors
may be approved through discretionary design review by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Cuts, fills and retaining structures will be minimized except as
reguired exclusively for foundations. Major topographic features shall maintain
their natural landforms.
      (5)   Roadways shall follow contours to also minimize cuts, fills and
retaining structures. Disturbed areas shall be revegetated to harmonize with
the surrounding environment, and retaining structures shall include planting or
similar means, as necessary, to harmonize as well.
      (6)   No roads or streets shall be permitted to traverse a ridge.
      (7)   If exterior lighting is to be installed, it shall conform to the
following:
         (a)   Light intensity. Lighting shall have a low-level of intensity,
meaning having a total light output on the site of 3,000 lumens or less and a
low profile;
         (b)   Shielding. All fixtures shall be fully-shielded to minimize
glare and protect the night sky.
         (c)   Color temperature. The color temperature of all outdoor lighting
shall be 3,000 Kelvin or less.
         (d)   Lighting curfew. A “dark sky” curfew shall be respected, and
unless outdoor lighting is for building entries or exits, pathways and adjacent
landscape areas, parking areas, or driveways, or is on a motion sensor that
shuts off five minutes after activation, all exterior lighting shall be
extinguished as soon as there are no longer people present in exterior areas.
         (e)   Light trespass. The maximum allowable “light trespass,” meaning
light falling beyond the property line, shall be 0.1 foot candles.
      (8)   Utilities and alternative energy systems.
         (a)   All utilities and cables shall be placed underground.
         (b)   Alternative energy sources, not including small residential
rooftop solar energy systems, may be approved where their impacts are
minimized. Small residential rooftop solar energy systems shall be subject to
the review and approval procedures set forth in §§
17.138.200 through
17.138.270. This provision supersedes §
17.044.020 of this title relating to public utilities.
      (9)   Ridgeline view protections.
         (a)   All structures shall be located so that the roof does not extend
into a ridgeline scenic corridor when viewed from a public gathering place,
including town parks, public schools, sidewalks in the Central Commercial area
identified in the General Plan, or a major roadway.
         (b)   No part of a building's height shall exceed 28.5 feet on an
upslope lot and 35 feet on a downslope lot, 24 feet within 20 feet of a front
property line on an upslope lot, and 24 feet at a rear setback line, measured
to the adjacent natural or finished grade, whichever is lower. One foot of
additional building height in the front and the rear is allowed if the portion
of the building above the 24-foot height limit is setback one foot, up to the
maximum height limits established for upslope lots (28.5 feet) and downslope
lots (35 feet).
         (c)   Where the Planning Commission approves the placement of a
structure so that its roofline extends into a ridgeline scenic corridor because
of a particular topographical feature or the location of the site and because
there is no other suitable building location on the site, no part of the roof
of the structure shall extend more than 15 feet above the lowest elevation of
the adjacent ridgeline and the maximum horizontal dimension above this
elevation shall not exceed 20 feet.
      (10)   In order to minimize bulk and mass, long, unbroken rooflines and
large, uninterrupted wall surfaces greater than 40 feet in length shall be
allowed only if there is a horizontal or vertical offset of at least five feet
or dormers break up the visual mass.
      (11)   A landscape documentation package shall be provided with the
development application that complies with the standards of the Model Water
Efficient Landscape which applies to all new residential development with 500
square feet or more of landscape area. If the total landscaped area is 2,500
square feet or less, an applicant may use the prescriptive compliance option
provided in Appendix D of the Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance to
streamline the review process.

1981)
§ 17.064.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AREA OF SIGN.
      (1)   The area in square feet of the smallest rectangle enclosing the
total exterior surface of a sign having but one exposed exterior surface;
should the sign have more than one surface, the sign area shall be the
aggregate area of all sign surfaces measured as above; except that, strictly
two-sided faced signs (surfaces back to back) shall be considered to have only
one face.
      (2)   If any structural element which supports a sign is designed,
painted or otherwise arranged so as to substantially contribute to the
advertising qualities of the sign, the structural elements shall be included in
the smallest rectangle used to compute the area of the sign.
      (3)   In the case where a name or design is applied directly to a wall
the area shall be the smallest rectangle enclosing the name and/or design. In
the case where a name or design is applied to an awning, the area shall also be
the smallest rectangle enclosing the name and/or design.
   AREA OF DOUBLE-FACED SIGN. The area of a sign in which the two faces are
parallel and not more than two feet apart. In computing the area of a
doublefaced sign, only one face of the sign shall be included.
   BUILDING FACE. The general outer surface of a main exterior wall of a
building. For example, a building whose plan is rectangular has four main
exterior walls and four building faces.
   BUILDING FRONTAGE. The portion of a building parallel and adjacent to a
public street and serving as the main access to the building.
   FREESTANDING SIGN. A sign which is self-supporting, standing on the ground
in a fixed location and not attached to or projecting over any building or

ARTICLE I: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE,
METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES, AND DEFINITIONS
§ 17.068.010 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of California has, in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65302,
65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt
regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Town Council of Fairfax does ordain as set out in
this article.
(Prior Code, § 17.36.010) (Ord. 577, passed - -1988)
§ 17.068.020 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Fairfax are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   (1)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas.
      (2)   Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Prior Code, § 17.36.020) (Ord. 577, passed - -1988)
§ 17.068.030 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in the areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
(Prior Code, § 17.36.030) (Ord. 577, passed - -1988)
§ 17.068.040 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve the uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Prior Code, § 17.36.040) (Ord. 577, passed - -1988)

without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which
they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters.
      (2)   A BREAKAWAY WALL shall have a safe design loading resistance of not
less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot.
      (3)   Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer
or architect and shall meet the following conditions:
         (a)   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood; and
         (b)   The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any
structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously in the event of the base flood.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations and storage of
equipment or materials.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of floodwaters, the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source and
the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of
water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of
water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually
high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or
by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal
surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in
flooding as defined in this definition.

by water from any source (see definition of FLOODING).
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as flood-plain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control

changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair

flood”, which will be the term used throughout this chapter.
   PERSON. An individual or his or her agent, firm, partnership, association or
corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its
agencies or political subdivisions.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this
is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts
may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development
from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook and the like.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). An area having special flood or flood-
related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE,
A99 or AH.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the
permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
either:
         (a)   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
         (b)   If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before
the damage occurred.
      (2)   For the purposes of this definition SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.
      (3)   The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

§ 17.068.210 STANDARDS OF CONSTRUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required.
   (A)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of §
17.068.240.
   (B)   Construction materials and methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
      (4)   Require within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (C)   Elevation and floodproofing.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood
elevation. Non-residential structures may meet the standards in division (C)(3)
of this section. Upon the completion of the structure the elevation of the
lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community’s Building Inspector be
properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvement of any structure in
Zone AO shall have the lowest floor, including basement, above the highest
adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the
FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. Nonresidential
structures may meet the standards in division (C)(3) of this section. Upon the
completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor including
basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor,
or verified by the Building Inspector to be properly elevated. Such
certification or verification shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (3)   Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance
with divisions (C)(1) or (2) of this section or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities:
         (a)   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         (b)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
         (c)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (4)   Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements,
that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not

for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Town Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is anerror in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   In passing upon such applications, the Town Council shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing divisions (C)(1) through (11) of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   (E)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (C) of this section and
the purposes of this chapter, the Town Council may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon
request.
(Prior Code, § 17.36.270) (Ord. 577, passed - -1988)
§ 17.068.280 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
   (B)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of, the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions (A)
through (D) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
   (F)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Town Council in the office of the Marin County Recorder and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.

§ 17.072.090 DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following objective development and design standards shall apply to new
development in the HRD overlay zone:
   (A)   Fire management. Projects must comply with the town’s Fire Code.
   (B)   Geologic hazards. Construction shall not be permitted on identified
seismic or geologic hazard areas such as on slides, on natural springs, or on
identified fault zones, without approval from the town engineer, based on
acceptable soils and geologic reports. Development shall be prohibited in areas
determined by the Town Engineer to be geotechnically unstable based on a report
by a licensed soils engineer where the Planning Commission determines that the
corrective work would be inconsistent with the purpose and the intent of this
chapter.
   (C)   Topographical.
      (1)   Graded slopes shall be sculptured and contoured to blend with
natural terrain. Cuts and fills shall not exceed one foot or rise for each one
and one-half feet of run without the approval of the Town Engineer.
      (2)   The grading plan shall include preventative measures to reduce dust
generation, protection of trees and other significant natural features.
      (3)   Retaining structures shall be shown in plan and elevation. Height
of retaining structures shall be minimized. Planting and choice of materials
shall be used to visually integrate the structures with natural surroundings.
      (4)   Grading plans shall include erosion control and revegetation
programs. Where erosion potential exists, silt traps or other engineering
solutions may be required. The timing of grading and construction shall be
controlled by the Town Engineer or other staff designated by the Town Engineer
to avoid failure during construction. No initial grading shall be done during
the rainy season, from October 1 through April 1.
   (D)   Ecological. Projects shall be designed to minimize disruption of
existing ecosystems. Removal,
changes or construction which will destroy important or rare vegetation and/or
wildlife habitats shall be avoided.
      (1)   Removal of any tree, as the term is defined in §
8.28.020, shall be subject to issuance of a tree removal permit as required by
Chapter 8.28 of this code.
      (2)   In areas of diverse wildlife habitat as delineated on the General
Plan Wildlife Habitat and Diversity Map, disruption of trees, shrubs and
natural vegetative cover shall be minimized.
      (3)   No development is permitted 50 feet either side of high water
centerline measured perpendicular to the high-water mark away from the
centerline. Water quality and natural conditions shall be maintained.
   (E)   Landscaping. Landscaping shall minimally disturb natural areas and
shall be compatible with native plant settings. Where appropriate use is
determined by the Planning Commission, fire-resistant and drought-resistant
species shall be utilized. Planting shall not obstruct views or alter solar
energy access of nearby properties.
      (1)   A landscape documentation package shall be provided with the
development application that complies with the standards of the Model Water
Efficient Landscape Ordinance which applies to all new residential development
with 500 square feet or more of landscape area. If the total landscaped area is
2,500 square feet or less, an applicant may use the prescriptive compliance
option provided in Appendix D of the Model Ordinance to streamline the review
process. Under this option, turf shall not exceed 25 percent of the landscape
area.
      (2)   No fill, grading, or construction shall be permitted within the
dripline of any existing tree designated for preservation except as may be
recommended by an arborist certified by the International Society of
Arboriculture or a California-registered professional forester.
   (F)   Circulation.
      (1)   Roads shall be designed to meet the requirements of the Town
Engineer, as set forth in the Subdivision Ordinance, and the Fire Department as
set forth in the Fire Code.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may require parking areas to accommodate
public and guest parking in addition to off-street parking for dwelling units.
      (3)   Off-street parking shall conform to the provisions of
Chapter 17.052 of this title.
   (G)   Design. Projects shall be designed to meet the criteria set forth in §
17.020.040 of this title.
   (H)   Low impact clustered development option. In order to enable the
creation of permanent open space that will connect or expand existing open
space, create wildlife corridors,and preserve habitat for endangered species,
the Planning Commission may approve a low impact clustered residential
development in an HRD overlay zone on sites greater than one acre with an
average slope greater than 15 percent that are identified in the General Plan
Housing Element for housing development, subject to design review and the
following standards:
      (1)   Maximum density. The maximum number of units (MN) shall be
determined by a slope density formula as follows, unless a different density is
set in the General Plan or the applicable base zone:
         MN = Development site area (sg. ft.) divided by (10,000 plus 1,200 for
each one percent increase in the average slope of the site above 15 percent).
      (2)   Minimum lot size. The Planning Commission may approve lots that are
less than the minimum lot size and dimensions that otherwise would be required
by the base zoning district or overlay zone, provided that the overall density
does not exceed the General Plan maximum for the site.
      (3)   Gross building square footage. The maximum permitted gross building
area for habitable space is limited to 3,500 sguare feet. Any garage space that
exceeds 500 square feet shall be counted as habitable space.
      (4)   Street layout. All new public streets and private streets shall
meet the standards of §
16.24.040, with the following modifications:
         (a)   New street and driveway grades shall not exceed 18 percent
unless an exception has been approved by the Planning Director and the Director
of Public Works to allow street and driveway grades up to 25 percent.
         (b)   Streets and driveways with slopes over 15 percent shall be a
permanent, durable, non-asphalt hardscape surface. Streets and driveways with
slopes over 18 percent shall have grooves/scoring for traction.
         (c)   A transition shall be provided at the street and driveway apron
to allow vehicles to safely transition to/from roadways and parking areas.
      (5)   Emergency access. At least two means of emergency ingress and
egress shall be provided to all clustered hillside developments with five or
more lots. Existing fire roads providing access to open space areas shall be
retained and maintained if this is determined necessary by the Fire Department.
      (6)   Site layout and building design. All clustered development shall:
         (a)   Locate development along the lowest portion of the property away
from ridgelines, adjacent to existing streets and/or on already disturbed land,
to the extent feasible, to protect undeveloped areas;
         (b)   Use split level building terraces, pier foundations and stepped
footings, as appropriate for the proposed building, to reduce grading and
visual impacts and break up building mass;
         (c)   Site buildings with different floor elevations to achieve height
variation;
         (d)   Design roofs with an offset of at least 18 inches, a change in

         (b)   Thirty-five feet on the downslope of a lot;
         (c)   Twenty-four feet within 20 feet of a front property line on an
upslope lot; and
         (d)   Twenty-four feet at a rear setback line, measured to the
adjacent natural or finished grade, whichever is lower.
         (e)   One foot of additional building height in the front and the rear
is allowed if the portion of the building above the 24-foot height limit is
setback one foot.
         (f)   The maximum height for accessory dwelling units is established
by
Chapter 17.048.
      (8)   Setbacks. The Planning Commission may approve varied setbacks to
preserve natural features, including zero-side yard setbacks provided a minimum
ten-foot separation is maintained between buildings, front setbacks are at
least ten feet, rear setbacks are at least 20 feet, and garage setbacks are at
least 18 feet. Carports only have to meet the ten-foot front setback.
         (a)   The subdivision map shall specify the location of each zero-lot
line house on a hillside cluster development lot.
         (b)   If the side wall of a house is five feet or less from the
property line, windows or other openings for habitable rooms that allow
visibility into adjacent yards are prohibited. However, windows and openings
that do not allow visibility into adjacent yards, such as a translucent window,
are allowed.
         (c)   To allow design flexibility, structures may encroach into a
required setback for 25 percent of the building length a distance not more than
one half of the reguired yard or setback, if approved by the Planning
Commission through design review, provided there is a compensating increase in
the opposing setback (a five-foot reduction in a front yard setback would
increase the rear yard setback by five feet).
      (9)   Required permanent open space. At least 75 percent of the site must
remain in its natural state and be preserved as permanent open space with a
conservation easement, dedication or transfer to the town, another public
agency, or an open space trust, or other development restriction, that runs
with the land and is approved by the Town Attorney, and recorded in the Marin
County Recorder's Office. None of this land can be used to meet the
requirements for common and private open space established by this chapter.
      (10)   Allowable housing types. The Planning Commission may approve a
variety of housing types, such as cluster cottage housing units, courtyard
clusters, detached town homes, and tiny houses, as well as traditional single-
family dwellings. Tiny houses shall meet the standards of § 17.138.520.
      (11)   Minimum private open space as outdoor living area. Each lot shall
have a minimum 200 square foot usable yard with a minimum dimension of not less
than ten feet.
      (12)   Common facilities. A clustered development may include shared
amenities for residents' use that are designed to offer recreational
opportunities and foster social interaction. These may include common open
space and a common house with a kitchen and dining area for residents and
guests at least 150 square feet in size, laundry, and/or recreational spaces,
as well as work space for artist studios and galleries with minimum horizontal
dimensions of 12 feet.
      (13)   A public access easement (or other development restriction that is
approved by the Town Attorney) shall be used to establish new trails and trail
connections to existing trails and public sidewalks to provide public access
through open space parcels. The development restriction that runs with the land
shall be recorded in the Marin County Recorder's Office.
      (14)   Parking. Parking shall be provided as required by
Chapter 17.052 and the following additional requirements.
         (a)   One guest parking space conveniently placed relative to the
dwelling unit shall be provided for every five units. The Planning Commission,
may approve:
            1.   A reduction in order to minimize grading or avoid tree
removal.
            2.   Allow for parking to be provided on-street in parking bays
meeting the standards for parking on narrow streets set in §
10.04.060.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may allow one of the required resident
parking spaces to be provided off-site in a common parking area that is within
200 feet of the main entrance to the dwelling unit.
      (15)   Landscaping. All low impact clustered residential development
shall:
         (a)   Revegetate scarred or graded areas.
         (b)   On slopes of 2:1 or greater, select plant materials with deep
rooting characteristics that will minimize erosion and reduce surface runoff.
Subdividers also shall use a series of low retaining walls, with sub-drain
lines, to increase planting areas, where feasible. This will reduce runoff and
potential erosion.
         (c)   Use irregular spacing for new plants to achieve a natural
appearance on graded slopes. Plant trees along contour lines in undulating
groups to create grove effects which blur the distinctive line of the graded
slopes, and plant shrubs of varying height between tree strands. Ground covers
of native and introduced species are appropriate for slope erosion control.
         (d)   Submit a landscape documentation package that complies with the
standards of the Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance which applies to all
new residential development with 500 square feet or more of landscape area. If
the total landscaped area is 2,500 square feet or less, an applicant may use
the prescriptive compliance option provided in Appendix D of the Model
Ordinance to streamline the review process. Under this option, turf shall not
exceed 25 percent of the landscape area.

ARTICLE I: GENERALLY
§ 17.100.010 PURPOSE.
    The CC central commercial zone is the central business district and the
retail commercial heart of the town. It should contain the most valuable land
and structures, on a square-foot basis, of any zone in the town. The
development of the CC central commercial zone caters to and invites pedestrian
traffic. Consequently, store frontages tend to be continuous and driveways,
blank walls and other conflicts with or deterrents to foot traffic tend to be
minimized. Residential uses provide both a nighttime population which is
commercially desirable and affordable living facilities for owners, workers and
those without automobiles.

§ 17.112.010 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purposes of the PDD planned development district include the
following:
      (1)   To encourage development of parcels sufficiently large as to permit
comprehensive site planning and building design;
      (2)   To provide a more flexible regulatory procedure by which the basic
public purposes of this title may be accomplished;
      (3)   To encourage variation in siting of buildings and the appropriate
mixing of several land uses, activities and dwelling types;
      (4)   To enhance the appearance and livability of the community through
encouragement of creative approaches to the use of land and the design of
facilities;
      (5)   To conserve natural features; and
      (6)   To promise and create public and private open space as an integral
part of land development design.
   (B)   These purposes are to be ensured through the preparation and
submission of comprehensive development plans showing proper site layout,
design character and integration with the surroundings; and through the
Planning Commission’s careful review of the plans.
(Prior Code, § 17.58.010) (Ord. 352, passed - -1973)
§ 17.112.020 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Five acres or more may be considered a planned development for
purposes of this chapter, provided the property is owned, or its development
controlled, by a single individual or legally constituted corporation or
partnership.
   (B)   In the case of property in various ownerships, all parties owning and
controlling property in the area to be developed shall become parties to a
legal agreement binding them to abide by the planned development plan, as
approved, with the agreement to run with the land as a condition of future use,
sale or lease.
   (C)   The development shall be initiated and completed by the applicant, or
joint applicants, as the case may be.
   (D)   (1)   Unless otherwise provided in the approval of the Planning
Commission, the developer may divide and transfer units of the development.
      (2)   The transferee shall complete the development and shall use and
maintain it, in strict accordance with the development plan as approved by the
Planning Commission and Town Council.
   (E)   (1)   All the provisions of this title are supplementary to all
subdivision regulations of the town.
      (2)   An application for approval of a tentative subdivision map of lands
zoned PDD shall not be accepted, except in conjunction with the concurrent
filing of a precise development plan under §
17.112.120.
      (3)    No tentative subdivision map shall be approved prior to the
approval of a precise development plan for the property covered by the
tentative map. The tentative map and precise development plan applications
shall be processed concurrently.
   (F)   Any project proposed on a property zoned PDD or proposed for rezoning
to PDD, where any portion of the project site meets one or more of the
categories contained in the Hill Area Residential Development Overlay Zone
applicability §

§ 17.112.030 GENERAL STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The following provisions shall apply in a planned development
district, together with all other applicable provisions of the town zoning and
subdivision ordinances. Where conflict in regulation occurs, the regulations
specified in this chapter or on a development plan approved pursuant to this
chapter shall apply:
      (1)   No planned development district shall include less than five acres
of contiguous land unless the Planning Commission and Town Council find that
property of less than five acres is suitable as a planned development district
by virtue of its unique historical character, topography, landscaping features
or other special characteristics as may be determined by the Planning
Commission.
      (2)   A planned development district shall be established by an ordinance
adopted by the Town Council after a recommendation by the Planning Commission,
in accordance with §§
17.004.030 through
17.004.120 of this title. Whenever a planned development district has been
established, its boundary shall be indicated on the zoning maps of the town.
      (3)   Where contiguous properties proposed for a planned development in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter are under separate ownership,
written consent of all participating property owners shall be filed with the
Planning Director before any application for a planned development can be
accepted by the town.
      (4)   Standards for area, coverage, light and air orientation, site
planning, density, yard requirements, open spaces, parking and screening shall
be governed by the standards of the residential, commercial or industrial
zoning district(s) most similar in nature and function to the proposed planned
development district (PDD) use(s), or by standards which the Planning
Commission shall by resolution from time to time adopt.
      (5)   All electrical and telephone facilities, fire alarm conduits,
street light wiring and other wiring conduits or facilities shall be placed
underground by the developer. Electric and telephone facilities shall be
installed in accordance with standard specifications of the serving utilities.

A density shall be further limited by site conditions including natural
resources, topographic and geological conditions and by the level of public
services and road conditions that can reasonably be provided.
   (C)   Planning Commission determination. The Planning Commission shall
consider the following criteria in further limiting density.
      (1)   Extent of lands which are hazardous to life and property due to
soils, geological, seismic or hydrological factors unless the hazards can be
mitigated by minor modifications to existing land forms and vegetation. These
determinations must be based on the analysis of a licensed engineering
geologist and/or civil engineer specializing in soils problems and hydrologist;
      (2)   The number of safe building sites which exist on the property;
      (3)   The cumulative impact of the development on existing circulation
and drainage systems.
   (D)   Gross acreage calculation.
      (1)   Density shall be set for gross acreage. Hazardous lands may be
excluded from the building area, but will be included in the calculation of
gross density per acre.
      (2)   In cases where a portion of the property falls within two different
categories in the General Plan, the Planning Commission shall determine an
aggregate density based on the percentage of gross acreage in each category.

geologic, hydrologic or fire hazard areas.
   (B)   A further purpose of this district is to implement large lot zoning
for lands shown in the General Plan with a density range of one unit per one
acre to one unit per ten acres.

§ 17.116.060 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following requirements for site preparation, design and use of the
project shall be imposed in the SF-RMP district as necessary to implement the
goals and policies of the Fairfax General Plan.
   (A)   The minimum area required for a planned development shall be four
acres of contiguous property unless the Planning Commission finds that property
of less than four acres is suitable for planned development in accordance with
all the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Where contiguous properties proposed for a planned development in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter are under separate ownership,
written consent of all participating property owners shall be filed with the
Planning Director before any application for a planned development can be
accepted by the town.
   (C)   (1)   All projects must conform to the adopted Fairfax General Plan or
to any accepted specific plan applicable to the area under consideration.
      (2)   A density shall be set, at the time the zoning is established,
which is consistent with limitations imposed by site conditions, including
natural resources, topographic and geological conditions, and the level of
public services and road conditions that can reasonably be provided.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria in
setting density:
         (a)   Extent of lands which are hazardous to life and property due to
soils, geological, seismic or hydrological factors unless the hazards can be
mitigated by minor modifications to existing land forms and vegetation; (These
determinations must be based on the analysis of a licensed engineering
geologist and/or civil engineer specializing in soils problems and hydrology.)
         (b)   The number of safe building sites which exist on the property;
and
         (c)   The cumulative impact of the development on existing circulation
and drainage systems.
      (4)   (a)   Density shall be set for gross acreage. Hazardous lands may
be excluded from the building area, but will be included in the calculation of
gross density per acre.
         (b)   In cases where a portion of the property falls within two
different categories in the General Plan, the Planning Commission shall
determine an aggregate density based on the percentage of gross acreage in each
category.
(Prior Code, § 17.60.060) (Ord. 352, passed - -1973; Am. Ord. 492, passed - -
1982)
§ 17.116.070 SITE PREPARATION.
   The following site preparation provisions apply in the SF RMP district:
   (A)   Projects must comply with the town’s Fire Code.
   (B)   Projects must comply with the excavation and grading provisions of
this code.
   (C)   Projects shall be designed to minimize disruption of existing
ecosystems. Removal, changes or construction which will destroy important or
rare vegetation and/or wildlife habitats shall be avoided.
      (1)   Projects must comply with the tree removal permit as required by
this code.
      (2)   In areas of diverse wildlife habitat as delineated on the General
Plan Wildlife Habitat and Diversity Map, disruption of trees, shrubs and
natural vegetative cover shall be minimized.
      (3)   The project must comply with §
17.040.040 of this title relating to setbacks near creeks.
   (D)   All developments should be designed and located to conserve energy
resources. The efforts might include, but are not limited to the clustering or
location of development to reduce driving time and structural designs which
maximize use of solar energy and reduce the use of electricity and fossil
fuels.
   (E)   The project must comply with
Chapter 17.060, Ridgeline Development.
   (F)   (1)   Roads shall be designed to meet the requirements set forth in
the subdivision ordinance and the Fire Code.
      (2)   Off-street parking shall conform to the provisions of
Chapter 17.052 of this title. The Planning Commission may require parking areas
to accommodate public and guest parking in addition to off-street parking for
dwelling units.

development when determined to be essential by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Project shall allow public reasonable access to significant
environmental resource areas such as watercourses, ridgelines, open spaces,
parks or other areas so designated by the Town Council.
      (5)   Any lands whose sole means of access is via existing residential
streets shall be limited to densities which will not produce substantial
increases in traffic volumes above the capacity of the streets. Traffic volumes
exceeding 20 percent of the capacity shall generally be considered substantial.
The aggregate densities of the other undeveloped parcels in the area will be
considered. The 20 percent level shall be used as a general guideline and is
intended to minimize adverse traffic impacts on existing neighborhood traffic
volumes depending upon the particular impact as may be identified in any
environmental impact report prepared for the planned development.
(Prior Code, § 17.60.070) (Ord. 352, passed - -1973)
§ 17.116.080 PROJECT DESIGN.
   The following project design requirements apply in the SF RMP district.
   (A)   Generally, buildings should be clustered in the most accessible, least
visually prominent, and most geologically stable portion or portions of the
site, consistent with the need for privacy to minimize visual and sound
intrusion into each unit’s indoor and outdoor living area from other living
areas. Clustering is especially important on open grassy hillsides. A greater
dispersal of buildings may be preferable on wooded hillsides to save trees. The
prominence of construction can be minimized by such devices as placing
buildings so that they will be screened by wooded areas, rock outcroppings and
depressions in the topography.
   (B)   Land to be preserved as open space may be dedicated by fee title to
the town or county prior to issuance of any construction permit, or may remain
in private ownership with appropriate scenic and/or open space easements in
perpetuity; and the town may require reasonable public access to public land
across those lands remaining in private ownership.
   (C)   The town or other designated public jurisdiction will maintain all
open space lands accepted in fee title. Where open space lands remain in
private ownership with scenic easements, these lands shall be maintained in
accordance with the adopted rules of the town and may require the creation of a
homeowners’ association or other organization for the maintenance of these
private open space lands where appropriate.
   (D)   Uses in open space areas shall be in accordance with policies of the
adopted open space element. Generally, uses shall be compatible with the
natural environment. Pedestrian and equestrian access shall be provided where
possible and reasonable.
   (E)   No part of a building shall exceed 35 feet in height above natural
grade and no accessory building shall exceed 15 feet in height above natural
grade.
   (F)   Materials and colors shall blend into the natural environment
unobtrusively, to the greatest extent possible.
   (G)   Landscaping shall minimally disturb natural areas, including open
areas, and be compatible with native plant settings. Fire protection and
minimal water use shall be considered in landscaping plans. The Planning
Commission shall have the authority to impose height restrictions on planting
materials.
(Prior Code, § 17.60.080) (Ord. 352, passed - -1973)
§ 17.116.090 MASTER PLAN.
   (A)   The applicant shall submit to the Planning Commission an application
for approval of a master plan for the entire area of a proposed planned
development.
   (B)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
application, after giving notice thereof, pursuant to the provisions of §
17.02.070 of this title. Approval of the master plan shall establish the
location and design of circulation elements, lotting patterns, buildings,
utilities, landscaping and open space.

   The Planning Commission shall approve the master plan if it makes the
following findings.
   (A)   The master plan is consistent with the General Plan.
   (B)   The circulation system is appropriate for the site and provides:
      (1)   Emergency vehicular access;
      (2)   Adequate parking; and
      (3)   Proposed densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as to
substantially overload the street network outside the development as set forth
in §
17.116.070(F)(5).
   (C)   Proposed structures are designed and located to:
      (1)   Harmonize with surrounding residential development;

   Minor changes to an approved master plan may be accepted by the Planning
Commission provided the change is determined to be consistent with the purposes
and character of the master plan. The changes shall not change the densities
heretofore established nor the boundaries of the subject property, nor any use
shown on the approved master plan, nor the location or amounts of land devoted
to specific land uses. All modifications or amendments to an approved plan
other than the minor changes shall be processed as an original application and
shall be subject to all applicable substantive and procedural requirements of
the master plan procedure.
(Prior Code, § 17.60.120) (Ord. 352, passed - -1973)
§ 17.116.130 MASTER PLAN; ACTION BY TOWN COUNCIL.

§ 17.126.010 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Purpose and applicability. The purpose of the Workforce Housing
Overlay (WHO) zone is to promote the development of affordable workforce
housing for lower and moderate income households in specific areas of the town
identified in the General Plan. The WHO contains WHO-A zone and WHO-B zone. The
WHO-A zone applies to downtown sites and permits densities of up to 75 dwelling
units per acre if specified percentages of affordable housing are provided: the
WHO-B applies to sites along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and permits up to 40
dwelling units per acre if specified percentages of affordable housing are
provided. In addition, the approval process for projects in the WHO zones is
streamlined, with ministerial approval for qualifying projects with affordable
housing using checklists and objective standards as required by state law.
   (B)   Relation to base zone. The WHO use regulations and development
standards only apply to proposed housing and mixed use projects, and these use
regulations and development and design standards zones shall apply in the case
of a conflict with the commercial zoning district regulations for the base
zones.
(Ord. 887, passed 2-7-2024)
§ 17.126.020 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Additional permitted uses. In addition to the uses that are permitted
within the applicable base zone with which the WHO zones are overlaid,
additional permitted uses in the WHO zones include multiple dwellings
(townhouses, condominiums, and apartments) and mixed use development
(residential units above the ground floor or adjacent to commercial, office, or
retail uses).
      (1)   (a)   In the WHO-A zone, the minimum density is one housing unit
for each 1 ,089 square feet of lot area, which represents a density of 40 units
per acre of net land area. The maximum density of 40 units per acre may be
increased up to a maximum of 75 units per net acre in exchange for a commitment
to make a greater percentage of the total units affordable in accordance with
Table 17.126.020-A. If the maximum number of units resulting from this
calculation yields a fraction, it shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
number.
         (b)   In the WHO-B zone, the minimum density is one living unit for
each 2,178 square feet of lot area, which represents a density of 20 units per
acre of net land area. The maximum density of 20 units per acre may be
increased up to a maximum of 40 units per net acre in exchange for a commitment
to make a greater percentage of the total units affordable in accordance with
Table 17.126.020-A. If the maximum number of units resulting from this
calculation yields a fraction, it shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
number.
      (2)   As an alternative to developing for-sale affordable units within a
residential or mixed use development project, for-sale residential and mixed
use development projects may satisfy the requirements of this section by
developing rental low-income units included within the residential portion of
the development equal to 20 percent of the total number of for-sale and rental
units included in the development. The developer may create a separate leqal
parcel within the development project upon which the rental low-income units
may be located. Also, the developer may, at its discretion. provide very
lowincome units instead of low-income units.

      (3)   If a project with at least 60 units per acre is in compliance with
the affordability requirements of
Table 17.126.020-A, then the developer is eligible for any or all of the
following additional incentives provided that, when all incentives are
combined, the overall density on the site shall not exceed 90 units per acre
prior to the application of any state density bonus:
         (a)   If a developer includes family units with three or more bedrooms
in a mixed use or residential only project, one bonus unit for each family unit
provided shall be permitted in addition to the density established in
Table 17.126.020-A up to a maximum of ten additional units. These bonus units
are not required to be income restricted.
         (b)   If a developer includes units for statutorily defined special
needs populations listed in Cal. Gov. Code § 65583(a)(7) (including the
elderly, persons with disabilities (including a developmental disability),
large families, farmworkers, families with female heads of households, and
families and persons in need of emergency shelter), one bonus unit for each
special needs unit provided shall be permitted in addition to the density
established in
Table 17.126.020-A up to a maximum of 10 additional units. These bonus units
are not required to be income restricted.
         (c)   For any unit that is eligible for more than one of the above
incentives, the developer shall identify and inform the town under which
incentive the bonus unit is beinq requested and, in the case of special needs
units, how continued occupancy for those with special needs will be assured,
which shall be subject to approval by the Town Attorney.
      (4)   Income qualifications for affordable units shall be determined in
the same manner established for inclusionary units in
Chapter 17.140. For moderate, low, very low, or extremely low affordable
housing units, deed restrictions or covenants shall be recorded with the Marin
County Assessor - Recorder - County Clerk and shall run with the land.
   (B)   Additional land use regulations for WHO zones.
      (1)   Residential only projects.
         (a)   A covered pedestrian entrance, that provides a minimum of three
feet of covered weather protection shall be provided in front of exterior entry
doors along primary building frontages.
         (b)   Windows and doors (with windows) shall be provided alonq primary
building frontages to achieve a minimum visual transparency of 25 percent of
the building frontage to allow for residents to view out and allow for sunlight
to come in.
         (c)   For privacy, building entrances at the ground floor shall be
separated from any public sidewalk either horizontally with a courtyard with a
minimum dimension of eight feet or vertically with a porch or stoop that is a
minimum of 18 inches in height.
      (2)   Types of mixed use allowed. Where the base zone allows commercial
uses, both horizontal and vertical mixed-use development shall be allowed in
the WHO zones.
         (a)   Horizontal mixed use development allows a range of uses adjacent
to one another, either in separate buildings or parcels. Individual buildings
may share project components, such as parking, serving, loading, and utility
areas.
         (b)   Vertical mixed use allows for a mix of uses within a single
building where nonresidential uses occupy the ground floor and residential uses
are on the upper levels. A vertical mixed use project may have surface parking,
subterranean parking decks, and/or at grade and above grade parking decks.
      (3)   Minimum amount of residential in a mixed use project. A minimum of
50 percent of the total floor area in a mixed use project shall be devoted to
residential use.
      (4)   Active and pedestrian-oriented frontages required in a mixed-use
project. Along the primary building frontage, active ground floor uses are
required in mixed use buildings with residential uses above commercial uses for
at least 70 percent of street-facing tenant space. These may include but are
not limited to retail shops, eating and drinking establishments, retail banks,
financial and business services, personal services, and offices for walk-in
clientele, such as employment agencies, insurance offices, real estate offices,
travel agencies, and offices for elected officials. In a mixed use project with
through lots, the primary frontage may be the frontage providing the principal
pedestrian access from an adjoining street; it does not have to be the frontage
with primary vehicular access.

[1]   Applies to mixed use projects only; for 100 percent residential
projects located outside of the Town Center Area shown on Figure TC-2 Town
Center Land Use Map in the General Plan, the maximum lot coverage shall be 60
percent (see Section
17.010.100 (Determining Lot Coverage).
 
 
 
Notes:
[2]   Additional height and an additional story is allowed up to 45 feet and four
stories in the WHO-A zone and 35 feet and three stories in the WHO-B zone for up
to one-half of the floorplate of the story below if the project includes at least
50 percent of the ground-floor building area accommodates commercial uses such as
retail, restaurants, or personal services with walk-in clientele. The maximum
height for the remainder of the building is 35 feet in the WHO-A zone and 28.5
feet in the WHO-B zone. Enclosures for elevators and stair towers, roof-top
equipment screens, roof-top open space amenities, and other vertical components
that are located on the roof may project up to ten feet above these height limits
provided they are stepped back at least ten feet from the edge of the building.
Parking levels are not counted in determining the number of stories on a site. At
least 75 percent of the street-facing elevation of a story above 35 feet shall be
setback back a minimum of ten feet from the front facade of the stories below
that height.
[3]   A minimum 20-foot setback must be provided for garages and carports facing
a street. In the WHO-B, allowable projections into required setbacks are those
listed in §
17.044.070. In addition, awnings and canopies may project up to six feet into a
required setback, and outdoor seating area shall be allowed in a required
setback.
[4]   Where ground-floor residential units are proposed with adjoining ground-
floor decks along a street frontage, a two-foot landscaped front or corner side
setback shall be provided between the deck and the street property line.
 
   (A)   Required building walls. Along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Bolinas
Road, and Broadway, building walls shall be constructed along or within ten
feet of the front property line for a minimum of 70 percent of the primary
street frontage and 40 percent on secondary street frontages. This requirement
may be waived by the Planning Director upon finding that:
      (1)   Ground-floor residential uses are proposed, a minimum 15-foot
setback will be provided, and substantial landscaping will be located between
the build-to and ground-floor residential units as a buffer:
      (2)   Entry courtyards, plazas, entries, or outdoor eating areas are
located between the build-to line and the building and buildings are
constructed at the edge of the courtyard, plaza, or outdoor dining area: or
      (3)   The building incorporates an alternative entrance design that
creates a welcoming entry facing the street.
   (B)   Building entrances.
      (1)   Principal building entries shall front upon the primary street.
      (2)   Building entries shall be accented with features such as moldings,
lighting, overhangs, canopies, or awnings.
      (3)   Where pedestrian paths or walkways cross parking areas or
driveways, the paths shall incorporate landscaping and decorative paving to
define the pedestrian space.
   (C)   Required ground floor transparency for non-residential uses. Exterior
walls for nonresidential ground-floor uses facing and within 20 feet of a front
or street side property line shall include windows, doors, or other openings
for at least 60 percent of the building wall area between two feet and eight
feet above the sidewalk. No street facing wall shall run in a horizontal plane
more than 25 feet without an opening.
      (1)   Openings fulfilling this requirement shall have transparent glazing
and provide views into display areas, sales areas, work area, lobbies or other
active spaces, and window displays shall be at least three feet in depth.
      (2)   Parking garages are not required to meet these transparency
requirements.
      (3)   Alternatives to the building transparency requirement may be
approved by the Planning Commission for uses that have unique operational
requirements making windows or doors infeasible or for street-facing building
walls that exhibit architectural relief and detail with landscaping that
creates visual interest at the pedestrian level.
   (D)   Open spaces standards for residential and mixed use projects. The open
space requirements of the RM Multiple-Family Residential Zone in §
17.088.050(B) for private areas and common areas shall apply to all proposed
residential development and to residential units in mixed use development with
the following modifications.
      (1)   In the WHO-A Zone, the minimum amount of outdoor living area
(private or common open space) is reduced to 150 square feet of open space for
each dwelling unit, of which at least 36 square feet (60 square feet for
ground-level units) shall be private open space serving at least 50 percent of
the individual dwelling units.
      (2)   In the WHO-B Zone, the minimum amount of outdoor living area
(private or common open space) is reduced to 200 square feet of open space for
each dwelling unit, of which at least 48 square feet (60 square feet for
ground-level units) shall be private open space serving at least 50 percent of
the individual dwelling units.
      (3)   Common open space may be provided on rooftops in areas having
minimum horizontal dimensions of ten feet. Roof decks located within 12 feet of
a residential zoning district shall be setback a minimum of 30 inches from the
building edge.
      (4)   Landscaped areas that are less than ten feet in width and
contiguous with and an integral part of the common open space or are connected
to the common open space may be counted in determining compliance with the open
space standards of this section provided they are at least five feet in width.
      (5)   The minimum amount of required common open space may be reduced by
20 percent if a site abuts or is within one-quarter mile walking distance of a
public park or playing field open to the public.
      (6)   At least half of the residential units constructed without private
open space (a deck or balcony) shall have a balconet (e.g., a Juliet balcony).

§ 17.126.060 REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Preliminary review. A developer requesting additional density above
the minimum density allowed for the site shall submit an application for
preliminary review, accompanied by the required application fee, for feedback
prior to the submittal of any formal requests for approval of additional
density. The purpose of the preliminary review is to determine whether the
proposed development is in substantial compliance with applicable zoning
regulations and objective development standards and to establish the basis and
procedures for granting the additional density. The following information is
required to be submitted for preliminary review in the form of a proposed
affordable housing plan:
      (1)   Evidence that the project includes the qualifying percentages of
affordable units set forth in §
17.126.020(A) to justify the additional density requested;
      (2)   Calculations showing the minimum density and the density with the
additional units proposed;
      (3)   Number and percentage of total units that are proposed to meet
affordability criteria and the income level to which the units will be
restricted; and
      (4)   A description of any proposed waivers or reductions of development
standards or other zoning requirements, consistent with the provisions of Cal.
Gov't Code § 65915(k).
   (B)   Design review required. All residential development or mixed use
development with residential units in an WHO zone is subject to design review
by the Planning Commission unless a project qualifies for ministerial review
under
Chapter 17.026; see division (C) below. The purpose of this design review
procedure shall be to determine compliance with the town's objective design
standards.
      (1)   Additional findings required for design approval. The Planning
Commission shall grant approval if it determines the project complies with the
design criteria of §
17.020.040 and the following additional findings:
         (a)   The proposed development meets the affordability criteria for
the requested density in accordance with the requirements of §
17.126.020(A); and
         (b)   The increased density would not have a specific adverse impact,
as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of § 65589.5 of the Cal. Gov't
Code, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real
property listed in the California Register of Historic Resources.
      (2)   Conditions of approval. In granting a design approval, the Planning
Commission has the authority to impose reasonable conditions that are related
and proportionate to what is being requested by the applicant, as deemed
necessary and appropriate to ensure that the provisions of the General Plan,
any applicable specific plan adopted by the Town Council, and this title are
met, including requirements for needed off-site public improvements. The
Commission may require reasonable guarantees and evidence that such conditions
are being, or will be, met.
   (C)   Streamlined ministerial review. An applicant that qualifies for
streamlined ministerial review under Cal Gov. Code § 65912.122 or other
provisions of state law may request such review. Procedures for streamlined
ministerial approvals are in Chapter 17.026. The additional Planning Commission
findings listed above are not required.
   (D)   Required affordable housing agreement for continued affordability and
deed recorded restriction. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for any
residential or mixed use development project with affordable housing units in
an WHO zone, the applicant shall enter into a written agreement with the town
ensuring the continued affordability of the affordable dwelling units for a
period of not less than 55 years or as long as the property is in residential
use, whichever is greater, for rental units and 55 years for for-sale units.
The terms and conditions of the agreement shall be binding upon the successor
in interest of the developer and shall be recorded as a deed restriction or
covenant in the office of the Marin County Assessor-Recorder-County Clerk and
shall run with the land. The agreement shall be executed by the Town Manager,
be in a form acceptable to the Town Attorney, and include provisions for the
following:
      (1)   The number and proportion of housing units affordable to moderate-
income, low-income, and very-low income households by type, their location, and
the number of bedrooms in each one;
      (2)   Standards for maximum qualifying household incomes and maximum
rents or sale prices;
      (3)   Minimum home buyer payments and sources of funds for them:
      (4)   The party responsible for certifying rents and sales prices of
affordable housing units and reporting this information to the town;
      (5)   The process that will be used to certify incomes of tenants or
purchasers of the affordable housing units;
      (6)   The manner in which vacancies will be marketed and filled,
including the screening and qualifying of prospective renters and purchasers of
the affordable units;
      (7)   Deed restrictions on the affordable housing units binding on
property upon sale or transfer and any subsequent sale or transfer;
      (8)   Enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the affordable rental units
are continuously occupied by eligible households and are not rented, leased,
sublet, assigned, or otherwise transferred to non-eligible households, with
reasonable allowances for inherited units and units initially occupied by very
low income individuals who incomes may increase to a low income level; and
      (9)   Project phasing, including the timing of completions, and rental or
sale of the affordable housing units, in relation to the timing of the market-
rate units.

§ 17.126.070 ADDITIONAL PARKING REGULATIONS.
   An applicant proposing a mixed use development may request modifications to
the parking standards for individual uses established in
Chapter 17.052 as follows.
   (A)   Reductions to the required number. An applicant may request, and the
Planning Commission may grant a reduction in the amount of required parking for
individual uses when one or more of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   Multiple uses may use joint parking facilities when operations for
the respective uses are not normally conducted during the same hours, or when
hours of peak use differ. Requests for the use of shared parking must meet the
following conditions:
         (a)   A parking demand study has been prepared which demonstrates that
there will be no substantial conflicts between the subject uses with regard to
principal hours of operation and periods of peak parking demand.
         (b)   The total number of parking spaces required for the subject uses
does not exceed the number of parking spaces reasonably anticipated to be
available at periods of maximum use.
         (c)   The proposed joint parking facility is not located further than
400 feet from the uses which it serves.
         (d)   A written agreement by and between the Town of Fairfax and all
other affected parties shall be executed and recorded with the county recorder,
assuring the availability of the number of parking spaces designated for joint
use, during the hours specified in the agreement, for the duration of the uses.
      (2)   The number of parking spaces required by
Chapter 17.052 may be reduced if it can be demonstrated that the use will not
utilize the required number of spaces due to the nature of the specific use, or
the manner in which the specific use is conducted.
      (3)   A residential or mixed use development project located within 400
feet of a bus stop may reduce the number of required parking spaces by up to
five percent.
      (4)   When an applicant can demonstrate on the basis of a parking demand
study to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that modifications in the
number of spaces or the standards or dimensions otherwise required by this
chapter are warranted for affordable housing, an alternative parking area
design and loading plan may be allowed with design approval. To grant such
modifications, the Planning Commission shall make the following findings in
addition to the findings otherwise required for a site approval:
         (a)   That the applicant qualifies for reduced parking under § 65915
of the Cal. Gov't Code; or
         (b)   That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the
alternative plan is a superior solution and the requested modifications in the
design and parking area layout standards are warranted to be able to reduce
development costs and, as a consequence, provide the required affordable
housing for the requested density; and
         (c)   That the alternative parking arrangement will be in place at all
times during operation and life of the principal uses to be served by the
parking.
   (B)   Location and design of parking areas.
      (1)   Parking spaces for multi-family dwellings shall be located within
150 feet, measured as a straight-line distance from the dwelling unit (front or
rear door) for which the space is provided.
      (2)   For residential development at densities exceeding 20 units per
acre, including residential uses in mixed use development, required off-street
parking located in the front half of a lot or within 25 feet of the side street
on a corner lot shall be covered with a carport, garage or roofed structure.
Other spaces may be uncovered if located in the rear half of the lot or site or
when more than 25 feet from a side street. On sites with ten or more dwelling
units, uncovered spaces are allowed if setback at least 50 feet from a front
property line and 25 feet from a street side property line and screened by a
wall or landscaping so as not to be visible from a public street.

§ 17.140.030 AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS.
   Residential development projects that include three or more dwelling units
shall include the construction of inclusionary units in accordance with this
chapter, unless an alternative means of compliance is permitted in accordance
with this chapter.
   (A)   Inclusionary requirements for for-sale dwelling units. Residential
development projects that include for-sale dwelling units shall provide
inclusionary units through one of the following means:
      (1)   For-sale residential development projects shall include deed
restricted, for-sale moderate-income units equal to 20 percent of the total
number of dwelling units in the project. The developer may, at its discretion,
provide very low-income units or low-income units instead of moderate-income
units.
      (2)   As an alternative to developing for-sale inclusionary units within
the residential development project as set forth above, for-sale residential
development projects may satisfy the requirements of this chapter by developing
rental low-income units included within the residential development equal to 20
percent of the total number of for-sale and rental units included in the
residential development. The developer may create a separate legal parcel
within the residential development project upon which the rental low-income
units may be located. The developer may, at its discretion, provide very low-
income units instead of low-income units.
   (B)   Inclusionary requirements for rental units. Residential development
projects that are comprised of rental units shall provide low-income
inclusionary units included within the project equal to 15 percent of the total
number of rental units in the residential development. The developer may, at
its discretion, provide rental very low-income units instead of low-income
units.
   (C)   Residential development projects with a combination of for-sale and
rental dwelling units. When a project includes a combination of for-sale and
rental units, the number and income levels for inclusionary units required for
the project shall be calculated for each category of dwelling units (i.e., for-
sale and rental) individually, and combined to comprise the residential
development project's total inclusionary housing requirement pursuant to this
chapter.
   (D)   Density bonus units. For purposes of calculating the number of
inclusionary units required, any additional units authorized as density bonus
units will not be counted in determining the required number of inclusionary
units.
   (E)   Fractional units. If in computing the total number of inclusionary
units required in a residential development project, there is a fractional unit
required, the applicant shall pay a housing in-lieu fee in the amount
determined in accordance with §
17.140.120 of this chapter, equal to the amount calculated for that fractional
unit on a per dwelling unit basis, unless the applicant elects to round up to
the nearest whole number of units and provide that unit.
(Ord. 884, passed 11-1-2023)
  § 17.140.040 EXEMPTIONS.
     The requirements of this chapter do not apply to:
   (A)   The reconstruction of any structures that have been destroyed by fire,
flood, earthquake or other act of nature provided that the reconstruction of

   (A)   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide a uniform and
comprehensive set of regulations and standards for the permitting, development,
siting, installation, design, operation and maintenance of wireless
telecommunications facilities in the Town of Fairfax to avoid visual impacts to
the downtown, scenic corridors, residential and visually distinctive areas; to
avoid impact to listed and candidate endangered species including habitats; and
to provide a uniform and comprehensive set of standards for the orderly
development of telecommunications facilities and installation of antennas.
These regulations are intended to prescribe clear and reasonable criteria to
assess and process applications in a consistent and expeditious manner, while
reducing the impacts associated with wireless telecommunications Facilities.
This chapter provides standards necessary to: (1) preserve and promote
harmonious land uses and the public right-of-way in the town; (2) promote and
protect public health and safety, community welfare, visual resources, and the
aesthetic quality of the town consistent with the goals, objectives, and
policies of the General Plan; (3) provide for the orderly, managed, and
efficient development of wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance
with the state and federal laws, rules, and regulations; and (4) encourage new
technology in the provision of wireless telecommunications facilities.
   (B)   This chapter is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or
applied to: (1) prohibit or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service
provider's ability to provide personal wireless services; (2) prohibit or
effectively prohibit any entity's ability to provide any interstate or
intrastate telecommunications service, subject to any competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory rules or regulation for rights-of-way management; (3)
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally-equivalent services;
(4) deny any request for authorization to place, construct or modify personal
wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions to the extent that such wireless facilities comply with the
FCC's regulations concerning such emissions; or (5) prohibit any collocation or
modification that the town may not deny under federal or state law.

§ 1455(a), as such law may be amended from time to time.
   SECTION 6409(a) APPROVAL. The approval required by § 6409(a).
   SHARED-LOCATION. More than one wireless communications facility comprised of
multiple structures used to support antennas operated by one or more carriers
where the structures are located within proximity to each other.
   SITE. The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.6100(b)(6), as may be
amended, which provides that for towers other than towers in the public rights-
of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the
tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and,
for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in
proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed
on the ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE. The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.6100(b)
(7), as may be amended, which currently defines that term differently based on
the particular wireless facility type (tower or base station) and location (in
or outside the public right-of-way). For clarity, this definition organizes the
FCC's criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the
wireless facility type and location.
      (1)   For towers outside the public rights-of-way, a SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE
occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall
height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not
to exceed 20 feet (whichever is greater); or
         (b)   The proposed collocation or modification increases the width
more than 20 feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the
wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or
         (c)   The proposed collocation or modification involves the
installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the
technology involved, not to exceed four; or
         (d)   The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation
outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the
wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to
the site.
      (1)   For towers in the public rights-of-way and for all base stations, a
substantial change occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall
height more than ten percent or ten feet (whichever is greater); or
         (b)   The proposed collocation or modification increases the width
more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station; or
         (c)   The proposed collocation or modification involves the
installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no
existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or
         (d)   The proposed collocation or modification involves the
installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent
larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets;
or
         (e)   The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation
outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment
already deployed on the ground.
      (3)   In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a
substantial change occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the
existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the
Zoning Administrator; or
         (b)   The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior
condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply
with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment
cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a
substantial change described in this section.
The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive. The
failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a
substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height increases are
cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the
cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted support structure
without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included
in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the
cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed
on February 22, 2012—the date that Congress passed § 6409(a).
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER or TOWER. A freestanding mast, pole, guyed tower,
lattice tower, free standing tower or other structure designed and primarily
used to support wireless telecommunications facility antennas. For the purposes
of "Eligible Facilities Requests", the term TOWER means the same as defined by
the FCC in 47 C.F.R.  § 1.6100(b)(9), as may be amended, which currently
defines that as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of
supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated
facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless
communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and
public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed
wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site.
   TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT. The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.6100
(b)(8), as may be amended, which currently defines that term as equipment that
facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless
communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers,
antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply.
The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services,
including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services,
as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as
microwave backhaul.
   UTILITY POLE. A pole or tower owned by any utility company that is primarily
used to support wires or cables necessary to the provision of electrical or
other utility services regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.
   WIRELESS SERVICES. Any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication
service transmitted over frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.
   WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY. Any facility constructed, installed,
or operated for wireless service. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY
includes, but is not limited to, antennas or other types of equipment for the
transmission or receipt of such signals, telecommunications towers or similar
structures supporting such equipment, related accessory equipment, equipment
buildings, parking areas, and other accessory development. WIRELESS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY does not mean any of the following:

in-person or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed, unless
the applicant received a written exemption from the Zoning Administrator at a
pre-submittal conference.
      (3)   Appointment scheduling procedures. For any event in the submittal
process that requires an appointment, applicants must submit a written request
to the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   Applications deemed denied. To promote efficient review and timely
decisions, the town may deem an application denied without prejudice to the
applicant to re-file as a new application when the applicant fails to tender a
substantive response to the town within 90 calendar days after the town deems
the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.060 LOCATION AND CONFIGURATION PREFERENCES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines to
applicants and the reviewing authority regarding the preferred locations and
configurations for wireless telecommunication facilities in the town, provided
that nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a wireless
telecommunication facility in any location or configuration that is otherwise
prohibited by this chapter.
   (B)   Review of location and configuration. The reviewing authority shall
consider the extent to which a proposed wireless telecommunication facility
complies with these preferences and whether there are feasible alternative
locations or configurations to the proposed facility that are more preferred
under this section.
   (C)   Order of preference – configurations. The order of preference for the
configuration for wireless telecommunication facilities from most preferred to
least preferred is:
      (1)   Collocation with existing facilities outside the public rights-of-
way;
      (2)   Roof-mounted;
      (3)   Building-mounted;
      (4)   Mounted on an existing pole or utility pole;
      (5)   Mounted on a new pole or utility pole that will replace an existing
pole or utility pole; and
      (6)   Mounted on a new telecommunication tower or pole.
   (D)   Order of preference – location. The order of preference for the
location of wireless telecommunications facilities from most preferred to least
preferred is:
      (1)   In the CH zoning district;
      (2)   In the CS zoning district;
      (3)   In the CC zoning district;
      (4)   In the CL zoning district;
      (5)   In the PD zoning district; and
      (6)   In the public right-of-way with the closest adjacent district being
a commercial district.
   (E)   Applications for new wireless communications facilities shall only be
for placement a minimum of 50 feet from all residences and a minimum 300 feet
from child day care centers, schools, playgrounds, parks, ballfields, and
medical facilities unless the applications include information sufficient to
demonstrate:
      (1)   The location and type of preferred sites which exist within the
proposed or technically feasible coverage area is mapped;
      (2)   The preferred location site was not available as shown by the good
faith efforts and measures taken by the carrier to secure the preferred
location sites;
      (3)   Specific reasons why such efforts and measures were unsuccessful;
      (4)   Specific reasons why the location of the proposed facility site is
essential to meet the service demands of the carrier; and
      (5)   Through reports required pursuant to §
19.04.050 demonstrating compliance with current federal health standards.
   (F)   Wireless communications facilities shall be attached or sited adjacent
to existing structures unless the carrier demonstrates to the satisfaction of
the town that no other technically feasible site exists or that construction of
a freestanding facility on or at a distant location from an existing structure
will mitigate adverse effects related to land use compatibility, visual
resources, public safety and other environmental factors addressed by CEQA.
Appropriate types of existing structures may include, but not be limited to:
buildings, water tanks and some telephone/utility poles.
   (G)   Monopoles for wireless communications facilities should not be located
in residential or open space areas unless technical evidence demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the town that no other alternative facility site or type of
antenna support structure is feasible and/or if the use of a monopole for the
proposed facility by itself or in combination with other existing, approved and
proposed facilities will avoid or mitigate adverse effects related to land use
compatibility, visual resources and public safety.
   (H)   Accessory equipment. In order of preference from most preferred to
least preferred, accessory equipment for wireless telecommunication facilities
and wireless telecommunications collocation facilities (excluding antennas and
electric meters) shall be located underground where possible, within a building
or structure, on a screened roof top area or structure, or in a rear yard if
not readily visible from surrounding properties and the roadway, unless the
reviewing authority finds that another location is preferable under the
circumstances of the application. The applicant shall bear the burden of
demonstrating that accessory equipment cannot be placed in the most preferred
location.
   (I)   Collocation and shared-location of wireless telecommunications
facilities should be required when it is feasible and mitigates adverse effects
related to land use compatibility, visual resources, public safety and other
environmental factors addressed by CEQA. Collocation and shared-location sites
should not be required when it creates or significantly increases such adverse
effects and/or technical evidence demonstrates to the satisfaction of the town
that it is not feasible due to service impairment or operational failures. To
ensure adequate and complete consideration of collocation and shared-location
siting of proposed wireless communications facilities, the carrier may be
required to submit to the town a graphic and written analysis which identifies
all technically feasible sites within the coverage area that would accommodate
the proposed service. The analysis shall include:
      (1)   Enough information to provide adequate consideration of technically
feasible alternative sites and/or facility designs that would avoid or minimize
adverse effects related to land use compatibility, visual resources, public
safety and other environmental factors addressed by CEQA;
      (2)   In writing, the specific factors for selection of the proposed
facility site over alternative sites;
      (3)   Facilities which are not proposed to be sited on a collocation or
shared-location site shall provide information substantiating the unfeasibility
of the sites; and
      (4)   The town may require independent peer review of the analysis prior
to making a decision on the permit applications. The analysis should, to the
extent practical, be incorporated with the coverage area map.
   (J)   The town should, to the extent practicable and legal, discourage
leases which convey exclusive (i.e., single user) rights for new wireless
communications facilities to the extent that the leases may preclude
development of a suitable collocation facilities site.
   (K)   The design of collocation sites should promote shared use among
different carriers. To the extent feasible, antenna support and equipment
structures should be designed to consolidate future planned facilities to
eliminate or minimize the visual clutter resulting from multiple
telecommunications structures. Where appropriate, as demonstrated by the
carrier and determined by the town, multiple antenna support structures may be
approved (shared-location) rather than a single larger/higher structure.
Facilities should make available unutilized space for collocation of other
antennas and equipment, including space for competing service carriers.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.070 DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR ALL FACILITIES.
   (A)   Basic requirements. The design and development standards set forth in
this section apply to all wireless telecommunications facilities no matter
where they are located. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be
designed and maintained so as to minimize visual, noise, and other impacts on
the surrounding community and shall be planned, designed, located, and erected
in accordance with the design and development standards in this section.
   (B)   Build-out period. Approvals will automatically expire six months from
the issuance date, unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals
required to install, construct and operate the approved wireless facility,
which includes, without limitation, permits required pursuant to Title 15, and
any other permits or approvals required by any federal, state, or local public
agencies with jurisdiction over the subject property, the wireless facility, or
its use and constructs the approved facility. The Zoning Administrator may
grant one written extension to a date certain when the permittee shows good
cause to extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension
submitted at least 30 days prior to the automatic expiration date in this
division (B). No further extensions may be granted but the permittee may
resubmit a complete application, including all application fees for the same or
substantially similar project.
   (C)   General guidelines.
      (1)    The applicant shall employ screening and camouflage design
techniques in the design and placement of wireless telecommunications
facilities in order to ensure that the facility is as visually inconspicuous as
possible, to prevent the facility from dominating and disrupting the
surrounding area, and to hide the facility from predominant views from
surrounding properties, all in a manner that achieves compatibility with the
community.
      (2)   For open space or hillside locations that would be generally viewed
from a distance, innovative design solutions may be appropriate where the
screening potential of a site is low (i.e., disguise facility as a landscape
element, public art and the like).
      (3)   Facilities should not be located on historically or architecturally
significant structures unless the Secretary of Interior's guidelines determine
that facilities can be visually and architecturally integrated with the
structure; historical landscapes shall be avoided.
      (4)   Facilities should be sited to avoid adverse impacts to existing
views from surrounding residences.
   (D)   Traffic safety; roads. All facilities shall be designed and located in
such a manner as to avoid adverse impacts on traffic safety. Whenever feasible,
existing roads and parking areas should be used to access, build and service
new telecommunications facilities. Any new access roads or parking areas
constructed shall be shared with subsequent telecommunications facilities and/
or other permitted uses to the extent feasible. New access roads constructed in
open space areas shall have the minimum width and surfacing necessary to meet
fire safety and access requirements, and shall be graded and drained consistent
with Town Code
Chapter 8.32, Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention. The size of new parking areas
shall be limited to the minimum necessary to accommodate vehicles associated
with periodic maintenance of the facility.
   (E)   Antennas. The applicant shall use the least visible antennas possible
to accomplish the coverage objectives. Antenna elements shall be flush mounted,
to the extent reasonably feasible. All antenna mounts shall be designed so as
not to preclude possible future collocation by the same or other operators or
carriers. Antennas shall be situated as to reduce visual impact without
materially compromising their function. Whip antennas need not be screened.
   (F)   Landscaping; vegetation.
      (1)   Where appropriate, facilities shall be installed so as to maintain,
protect, and enhance existing landscaping on the site, including trees,
foliage, and shrubs, whether or not utilized for screening. Additional
landscaping shall be planted, irrigated, and maintained where such vegetation
is deemed necessary by the town to provide screening or to block the line of
sight between facilities and adjacent uses.
      (2)   Applications for wireless facilities shall be accompanied by a
landscape plan that shows existing vegetation, indicates any vegetation
proposed for removal or trimming, and identifies proposed planting by type,
size and location. The emphasis of the landscape plan should be to visually
screen the proposed facility and stabilize soils on sloping sites. Introduced
vegetation shall be native, drought tolerant species compatible with the
predominant natural setting of the project area.
      (3)   Existing trees and other screening vegetation in the vicinity of
the proposed facility and associated accessways shall be protected from damage
both during and after construction. Submission of a tree protection plan may be
required to ensure compliance with this requirement.
      (4)   All vegetation disturbed during project construction shall be
replanted with compatible vegetation and soils disturbed by development shall
be reseeded to control erosion.
      (5)   No vegetation shall be removed subsequent to project completion,
except to comply with local and state fire safety regulations, to prevent the
spread of disease as required by the state's Food and Agriculture Department,
or to prevent safety hazards to people and property.
      (6)   The carrier shall enter into a landscape performance and
maintenance agreement with the town to ensure the installation and
establishment of required landscaping. This agreement shall be secured by
financial securities in an amount equal to 150 percent of estimates to cover
the cost of materials and labor for required improvements. The duration of the
landscape maintenance agreement shall be for a minimum period of no less than
one year and may be extended for an additional period of up to two additional
years upon renewal of the permit applications.
      (7)   Antennas and associated structures and equipment shall be painted
to blend with the structures, vegetation, sky or landscape against which they
will be primarily viewed.
      (8)   Wireless telecommunications facilities are not permitted on
ridgelines.
   (G)   Signage. Wireless telecommunications facilities and wireless
telecommunications collocation facilities shall not bear any signs or
advertising devices other than certification, warning, or other signage
required by law or permitted by the town.
   (H)   Lighting. No wireless telecommunications facility may be illuminated,
unless either specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or
other government agency or in association with the illumination of an athletic
field on town or school property. Lightning arresters and beacon lights are not
permitted, unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration, FCC or other
applicable regulations for health and safety. Legally-required lightning
arresters and beacons shall be included when calculating the height of
facilities. If lighting is permitted, the following requirements apply to such
lighting:
      (1)   Mechanically-operated, low wattage, hooded and downward directed
exterior lighting shall be permitted for safety purposes only and shall be kept
off, except when maintenance or safety personnel are present at night.
      (2)   Tower lighting required under FAA regulations should, to the
greatest extent feasible, be shielded or directed to minimize light and glare
impacts visible from publicly accessible areas.
      (3)   Nighttime lighting of warning signs required near publicly
accessible facilities must consist of low-wattage fixtures, and must be
directed downward and hooded to mitigate impacts visible from publicly
accessible areas.
   (I)   Noise.
      (1)   Each wireless telecommunications facility and wireless
telecommunications collocation facility shall be operated in such a manner so
as to minimize any possible disruption caused by noise.
      (2)   Normal testing and maintenance activities shall not take place
weekends, holidays or between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., excluding
emergency repairs. Normal testing and maintenance activities, which do not
involve the use or operation of telecommunications and maintenance equipment
that is audible from residences and other nearby sensitive receptors, may occur
at all other times.
      (3)   Backup generators shall only be operated during periods of power
outages or emergency occurrences, and shall not be tested on weekends,
holidays, or between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
      (4)   At no time shall equipment noise from any facility exceed an
exterior noise level of 50 dBA at the facility's property line if the facility
is located in a business or commercial zone that permits those uses; provided,
however, that for any such facility located within 500 feet of any property
zoned residential or improved with a residential use, such equipment noise
shall not exceed an exterior noise level of 40 dBA at the property line of any
such residential property. For any facility located within a residential zone,
such equipment noise shall at no time be audible at the property line of any
residentially-improved or residential zoned property.
      (5)   Any equipment, including, but not limited to, air conditioning
units, that may emit noise that would be audible from either beyond three feet
from the facility in the case of a facility located in the right-of-way, or the
facility's property line in the case of other facilities, shall be enclosed or
equipped with noise attenuation devices to the extent necessary to ensure
compliance with applicable noise limitations under the Fairfax Municipal Code.
   (J)   Security. Each wireless telecommunications facility shall be designed
to be resistant to, and minimize opportunities for, unauthorized access,
climbing, vandalism, graffiti, and other conditions that would result in
hazardous situations, visual blight, or attractive nuisances. The reviewing
authority may require the provision of warning signs, fencing, anti-climbing
devices, or other techniques to prevent unauthorized access.
   (K)   Modification. At the time of modification of a wireless
telecommunications facility, existing equipment shall, to the extent feasible,
be replaced with equipment that reduces visual, noise, and other impacts,
including but not limited to undergrounding the equipment and replacing larger,
more visually-intrusive facilities with smaller, less visually-intrusive
facilities.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.080 ADDITIONAL DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR FACILITIES OUTSIDE
THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Basic requirements. Facilities located outside the public right-of-way
are subject to the design and development standards set forth in this section
in addition to all design and development standards that apply to all
facilities.
   (B)   No parking interference. In no event shall the installation of
facilities replace or interfere with parking spaces in such a way as to reduce
the total number of parking spaces below the number that is required.
   (C)    Roof-mounted facilities. Roof-mounted facilities shall be designed
and constructed to be fully concealed or screened in a manner compatible with
the existing architecture of the building the facility is mounted to in color,
texture, and type of material. Screening shall not increase the bulk of the
structure nor alter the character of the structure. Roof-mounted antennas and
associated equipment shall be located as far back from the edge of the roof as
possible to minimize visibility from street level locations. Where appropriate,
construction of a roof-top parapet wall to hide the facility may be required.
To avoid or mitigate the appearance of visual clutter on rooftops, proposed
facilities should, to the extent feasible, be located adjacent to existing
rooftop antennas or equipment, incorporated into rooftop antenna or equipment
enclosures, or otherwise screened from view. In addition, existing rooftop
antennas and equipment should be consolidated where practical and shall be
removed if abandoned.
   (D)   Wall-mounted antennas shall be integrated architecturally with the
style and character of the structure or otherwise made as unobtrusive as
possible. If possible, antennas should be located entirely within an existing
or newly-created architectural feature so as to be completely screened from
view. To the extent feasible, wall-mounted antennas should not be located on
the front, or most prominent facade of a structure, and should be located above
the pedestrian line-of-sight.
   (E)   Facilities mounted to a telecommunications tower.
      (1)   Facilities mounted to a telecommunications tower shall be located
in close proximity to existing above-ground utilities, such as electrical
towers or utility poles (which are not scheduled for removal or under grounding
for at least 18 months after the date of application), light poles, trees of
comparable heights, and in areas where they will not detract from the
appearance of the town.
      (2)   Facilities mounted to a telecommunications tower, including, but
not limited to, the attached antennas, shall be designed to be the minimum
functional height and width required to adequately support the proposed
facility and meet FCC requirements. The applicant shall provide documentation
satisfactory to the Zoning Administrator establishing compliance with this
division (E)(2). In any event, facilities mounted to a telecommunications tower
shall not exceed the applicable height limit for structures in the applicable
zoning district.
      (3)   Aside from the antenna itself, no additional equipment may be
visible. All cables, including, but not limited to, electrical and utility
cables, shall be laid within the interior of the telecommunications tower and
camouflaged or hidden to the fullest extent feasible without jeopardizing the
physical integrity of the tower.
      (4)   Pole installations shall be situated so as to utilize existing
natural or man-made features including topography, vegetation, buildings, or
other structures to provide the greatest amount of visual screening.
      (5)   All antenna components and accessory wireless equipment shall be
treated with exterior coatings of a color and texture to match the predominant
visual background or existing architectural elements so as to visually blend in
with the surrounding development. Subdued colors and non-reflective materials
that blend with surrounding materials and colors shall be used.
      (6)   Poles shall be no greater in diameter or other cross-sectional
dimensions than is necessary for the proper functioning of the facility.
      (7)   If a faux tree is proposed for the pole installation, it shall be
of a type of tree compatible with those existing in the immediate areas of the
installation. If no trees exist within the immediate areas, the applicant shall
create a landscape setting that integrates the faux tree with added species of
a similar height and type. Additional camouflage of the faux tree may be
required depending on the type and design of faux tree proposed.
   (F)   Accessory equipment. All accessory equipment associated with the
operation of any wireless telecommunications facility shall be fully screened
or camouflaged and located so as to minimize their visibility to the greatest
extent possible, utilizing the following methods for the type of installation:
      (1)   Accessory equipment for roof-mounted facilities shall be installed
inside the building to which it is mounted or underground, if feasible. If not
feasible, such accessory equipment may be located on the roof of the building
that the facility is mounted on, provided that both the equipment and screening
materials are painted the color of the building, roof, or surroundings. All
screening materials for roof-mounted facilities shall be of a quality and
design that is architecturally integrated with the design of the building or
structure.
      (2)   Accessory equipment for facilities mounted to a telecommunications
tower shall be visually screened by locating the equipment either within a
nearby building, in an underground vault (with the exception of required
electrical panels), or in another type of enclosed structure, which shall
comply with the development and design standards of the zoning district in
which the accessory equipment is located. Such enclosed structure shall be
architecturally treated and adequately screened from view by landscape
plantings, decorative walls, fencing or other appropriate means, selected so
that the resulting screening will be visually integrated with the architecture
and landscaping of the surroundings.
      (3)    Whenever possible, base stations, equipment cabinets, back-up
generators and other equipment associated with building-mounted antennas should

or welfare or the public's use of the public right-of-way.
      (8)   Any modification, removal, or relocation of the facility shall be
completed within 90 days of written notification by the town, unless exigencies
dictate a shorter period for removal or relocation. Modification or relocation
of the facility shall require submittal, review, and approval of a permit
amendment pursuant to the Fairfax Municipal Code. The permittee shall be
entitled, on permittee's election, to either a pro-rata refund of fees paid for
the original permit or to a new permit, without additional fee, at a location
as close to the original location as the standards set forth in the Fairfax
Municipal Code allow. In the event the facility is not modified, removed, or
relocated within said period of time, the town may cause the same to be done at
the sole cost and expense of permittee. Further, due to exigent circumstances
as provided in the Fairfax Municipal Code, the town may modify, remove, or
relocate wireless telecommunications facilities without prior notice to
permittee, provided permittee is notified within a reasonable period
thereafter.
      (9)   The applicant has the right to enter the public right-of-way

the term for a § 6409(a) approval shall be coterminous with the underlying
permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base
station.
      (3)   Accelerated permit terms due to invalidation. In the event that any
court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of § 6409(a) or any FCC
Rule 1217 that interprets § 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate
approval for any § 6409(a) approval, such § 6409(a) approvals shall
automatically expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order,
unless the decision would not authorize accelerated termination of previously-
approved § 6409(a) approvals or the Zoning Administrator grants an extension
upon written request from the permittee that shows good cause for the
extension, which includes, without limitation, extreme financial hardship.
Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the contrary, the Zoning
Administrator may not grant a permanent exemption or indefinite extension. A
permittee shall not be required to remove its improvements approved under the
invalidated § 6409(a) approval when it has submitted an application for a
conditional use permit for those improvements before the one-year period ends.
      (4)   No waiver of standing. The town's grant or grant by operation of
law of a § 6409(a) approval does not waive, and shall not be construed to
waive, any standing by or right of the town to challenge § 6409(a), any FCC
rules that interpret § 6409(a), or any § 6409(a) approval.
      (5)   Build-out period. The § 6409(a) approval will automatically expire
one year from the issuance date, unless the permittee obtains all other permits
and approvals required to install, construct and operate the approved wireless
facility, which includes, without limitation, any permits or approvals required
by the any federal, state, or local public agencies with jurisdiction over the
subject property, the wireless facility, or its use. The Zoning Administrator
may grant one written extension to a date certain when the permittee shows good
cause to extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension
submitted at least 30 days prior to the automatic expiration date in this
division (I)(5). Any further extensions may be granted by the Planning
Commission, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the same procedures to request
an extension from the Zoning Administrator.
      (6)   Maintenance obligations; vandalism. The permittee shall keep the
site, which includes, without limitation, any and all improvements, equipment,
structures, access routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean, and
safe condition in accordance with the approved plans and all conditions in the
§ 6409(a) approval. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter
and debris at all times. The permittee, at its sole cost, shall remove and
remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within two days after the
permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or
other vandalism occurred.
      (7)   Compliance with laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at
all times with all federal, state, and local laws applicable to the permittee,
the subject property, the wireless facility, or any use or activities in
connection with the use authorized in this § 6409(a) approval, including, but
not limited to, compliance with the Americans with Disability Act. The
permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to
be broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in these
conditions are intended to reduce, relieve, or otherwise lessen the permittee's
obligations to maintain compliance with all applicable laws.
      (8)   Adverse impacts on other properties. The permittee shall use all
reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on
nearby properties that may arise from the permittee's construction,
installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal, or other
activities at the site. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to
perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance,
repair, removal, or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines on any
day and at any time prohibited under the Fairfax Municipal Code. The restricted
work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an
actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency
declared by the town. The Zoning Administrator may issue a stop work order for
any work that violates this condition.
      (9)   Noise complaints. The permittee shall conduct all activities on the
site in compliance with the noise standards in the Fairfax Municipal Code. In
the event that any person files a noise complaint and the town verifies that
such complaint is valid, the permittee must remedy the violation within ten
days after notice from the town, which may include a demonstration that the
permittee has amended its operational guidelines in situations where the
violation arises from the permittee's personnel rather than the permittee's
equipment.
      (10)   Inspections; emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the town or its designee may enter onto the site and inspect the
improvements and equipment upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee;
provided, however, that the town or its designee may, but is not obligated to,
enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair, disable, or
remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements
or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The
permittee will be permitted to supervise the town or its designee while such
inspection or emergency access occurs.
      (11)   Contact information. The permittee shall furnish the town with
accurate and up-to-date contact information for a person responsible for the
wireless facility, which includes, without limitation, such person's full name,
title, direct telephone number, facsimile number, mailing address, and email
address. The permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date at all
times.
      (12)   Performance bond. Before the town issues any construction permit
in connection with the wireless facility, if, in the town's sole discretion,
the existing performance bond for the facility is inadequate or the facility is
not associated with any existing performance bond, the permittee shall post a
performance bond from a surety and in a form acceptable to the Town Manager in
an amount equal to or greater than a written estimate from a qualified
contractor with experience in wireless facilities removal. The written estimate
must include the cost to remove all equipment and other improvements, which
includes, without limitation, all antennas, radios, batteries, generators,
utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets, hardware, cables, wires, conduits,
structures, shelters, towers, poles, footings and foundations, whether above
ground or below ground, constructed or installed in connection with the
wireless facility. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under
this condition, and in accordance with Cal. Government Code § 65964(a), the
Town Manager shall take into consideration information provided by the
permittee regarding the cost to remove the wireless facility.
      (13)   Conditions of approval shall specify a maximum number of trips on
a case-by-case basis based upon the carrier's maintenance and testing schedule.

   A permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall not be a substitute for any
business license otherwise required under the Fairfax Municipal Code.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.170 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT.
   In the event of a declared federal, state, or local emergency, or when
otherwise warranted by conditions that the Zoning Administrator deems to
constitute an emergency, the Zoning Administrator may approve the installation
and operation of a temporary wireless telecommunications facility (e.g., a cell
on wheels or "COW"), which is subject to such reasonable conditions that the
Zoning Administrator deems necessary.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.180 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   All wireless telecommunications facilities must comply at all times
with the following operation and maintenance standards. All necessary repairs
and restoration shall be completed by the permittee, owner, or operator within
48 hours:
      (1)   After discovery of the need by the permittee, owner, operator or
any designated maintenance agent; or
      (2)   After permittee, owner, operator, or any designated maintenance
agent receives notification from a resident or the Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   All facilities, including, but not limited to, telecommunication
towers, poles, accessory equipment, lighting, fences, walls, shields, cabinets,
artificial foliage or camouflage, and the facility site shall be maintained in
good condition, including ensuring the facilities are reasonably free of:
      (1)   General dirt and grease;
      (2)   Chipped, faded, peeling, and cracked paint;
      (3)   Rust and corrosion;
      (4)   Cracks, dents, and discoloration;
      (5)   Missing, discolored, or damaged artificial foliage or other
camouflage;
      (6)   Graffiti, bills, stickers, advertisements, litter and debris;
      (7)   Broken and misshapen structural parts; and
      (8)   Any damage from any cause.
   (C)   All trees, foliage, and other landscaping elements approved as part of
the facility shall be maintained in good condition at all times, and the
permittee, owner, and operator of the facility shall be responsible for
replacing any damaged, dead, or decayed landscaping. No amendment to any
approved landscaping plan may be made until it is submitted to and approved by
the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   The permittee shall replace its facilities, after obtaining all
required permits, if maintenance or repair is not sufficient to return the
facility to the condition it was in at the time of installation.
   (E)   Each facility, operating alone and in conjunction with other
telecommunications facilities, shall be operated and maintained at all times in
compliance with applicable federal regulations, including FCC radio frequency
emissions standards. Within one month post-construction and annually
thereafter, permittee must provide a radio frequency report as a condition of
project approval to verify that actual levels of radio frequency emitted by the
approved facilities, operating alone and in combination with other approved
facilities, substantially conform to the pre-approved radio frequency report
and do not exceed current standards for permissible human exposure to radio
frequency as adopted by the FCC. In the event of an increase over accepted
levels is detected, the permittee shall be responsible for immediately making
the necessary adjustments to comply with FCC standards.
   (F)   Each facility shall be operated and maintained to comply at all times
with the noise regulations of this chapter and shall be operated and maintained
in a manner that will minimize noise impacts to surrounding residents. Except
for emergency repairs, any testing and maintenance activities that will be
audible beyond the property line shall only occur between the hours of 7:00
a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, unless
alternative hours are approved by the Zoning Administrator. Backup generators,
if permitted, shall only be operated during periods of power outages or for
testing.
   (G)   If a flagpole is used for camouflaging a wireless telecommunications
facility, flags shall be flown and shall be properly maintained at all times.
   (H)   Each owner or operator of a facility shall routinely inspect each site
to ensure compliance with the standards set forth in this section and the
conditions of approval.
   (I)   Annual certification.
      (1)   Each year on July 1, the permittee shall submit an affidavit which
shall list, by location, all facilities it owns within the town by location,
and shall certify (1) each such installation remains in use; (2) that such in
use facility remains covered by insurance; and (3) each such installation which
is no longer in use, and pay applicable recertification fees established by the
town. Any facility which is no longer in use shall be removed by permittee
within 60 days of delivery of the affidavit, or be subject to a fine of $100
per day until removal.
      (2)   Where such annual re-certification has not timely submitted, or
equipment no longer in use has not been removed within the required 60-day
period, no further application for that small cell wireless installation will
be accepted by the town until such time as the annual re-certification has been
submitted and fee and fines paid.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.190 NO DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OR OBSTRUCTIONS ALLOWED.
   No person shall install, use, or maintain any wireless telecommunications
facility which in whole or in part rests upon, in or over any public sidewalk
or parkway, when such installation, use, or maintenance endangers or is
reasonably likely to endanger the safety of persons or property, or when such
site or location is used for public utility purposes, public transportation
purposes, or other governmental use, or when such facility unreasonably
interferes with or impedes the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic
including any legally parked or stopped vehicle, the ingress into or egress
from any residence or place of business, the use of poles, posts, traffic signs
or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, permitted sidewalk dining, permitted street
furniture, or other objects permitted at or near said location.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.200 PERMIT EXPIRATION.
   (A)   A permit for any wireless telecommunications facility shall be valid
for a period of ten years, unless the Planning Commission authorizes a
different period, or pursuant to another provision of the Fairfax Municipal
Code the permit lapses sooner or is revoked. At the end of such period, the
permit shall expire.
   (B)   A permittee may apply for renewals of its permit in increments of no
more than ten years and no sooner than 12 months prior to expiration of the
permit.
   (C)   An application for renewal shall be evaluated based on federal, state,
and local law as it exists at the time applicant seeks renewal. The following
may also be required for an application to renew a wireless permit:
      (1)   At the Zoning Administrator's discretion, additional studies and
information may be required of the applicant.
      (2)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that the facility is
nonconforming or that additional conditions of approval are necessary to bring
the facility into compliance with the provisions of the Fairfax Municipal Code
that are then in effect, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the renewal
request to the Planning Commission.
   (D)   The request for a renewal shall be decided by the Planning Commission
if the permit expired before the application is made for a renewal or if the
Zoning Administrator refers the matter to the Planning Commission. After notice
and a public hearing, the Planning Commission may approve, conditionally
approve, or deny the renewal. A permit application may not be renewed if the
facility is not upgraded to mitigate its impacts, including land use
compatibility, visual resources, public safety or other factors addressed by
CEQA, to the greatest extent permitted by technology which exists at the time
of renewal and is consistent with the provisions of adequate service at
affordable rates.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.210 CESSATION OF USE OR ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   A wireless telecommunications facility is considered abandoned and
shall be promptly removed as provided herein if it ceases to provide wireless
telecommunications services for 90 or more consecutive days. If there are two
or more users of a single facility, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the facility.
   (B)   The operator of a facility shall notify the town in writing of its
intent to abandon or cease use of a permitted site or a nonconforming site
(including unpermitted sites) within ten days of ceasing or abandoning use.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the operator of the facility shall
provide written notice to the Zoning Administrator of any discontinuation of
operations of 30 days or more.
   (C)   Failure to inform the Zoning Administrator of cessation or
discontinuation of operations of any existing facility as required by this
section shall constitute a violation of any approvals and be grounds for:
      (1)   Prosecution;
      (2)   Revocation or modification of the permit;
      (3)   Calling of any bond or other assurance required by this chapter or
conditions of approval of the permit;
      (4)   Removal of the facilities by the town in accordance with the
procedures established under the Fairfax Municipal Code for abatement of a
public nuisance at the owner's expense; and
      (5)   Any other remedies permitted under the Fairfax Municipal Code or
applicable law.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.220 REMOVAL AND RESTORATION, PERMIT EXPIRATION, REVOCATION OR
ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   Permittee's removal obligation. Upon the expiration date of the
permit, earlier termination or revocation of the permit or abandonment of the
facility, the permittee, owner or operator shall remove its wireless
telecommunications facility and restore the site to its natural condition,
except for retaining the landscaping improvements and any other improvements at
the sole discretion of the Zoning Administrator. Removal shall be in accordance
with proper health and safety requirements and all ordinances, rules, and
regulations of the town. The facility shall be removed from the property within
30 days of the permit's expiration, at no cost or expense to the town. If the
facility is located on private property, the private property owner shall also
be jointly and severally responsible for the expense of timely removal and
restoration.
   (B)   Failure to remove. Failure of the permittee, owner, or operator to
promptly remove its facility and restore the property within 30 days after
expiration, earlier termination, or revocation of the permit, or abandonment of
the facility, shall be a violation of the Fairfax Municipal Code, and be
grounds for:
      (1)   Prosecution;
      (2)   Calling of any bond or other assurance required by this chapter or
conditions of approval of permit;
      (3)   Removal of the facilities by the town in accordance with the
procedures established under the Fairfax Municipal Code for abatement of a
public nuisance at the owner's expense; or
      (4)   Any other remedies permitted under the Fairfax Municipal Code.
   (C)   Summary removal. In the event the Zoning Administrator determines that
the condition or placement of a wireless telecommunications facility located in
the public right-of-way constitutes a dangerous condition, obstruction of the
public right-of-way, or an imminent threat to public safety, or determines
other exigent circumstances require immediate corrective action (collectively,
"exigent circumstances"), the Zoning Administrator may cause the facility to be
removed summarily and immediately without advance notice or a hearing. If the
circumstances allow for it and, to the extent feasible, the Zoning
Administrator will notify the permittee to remove the facility and allow for
the reinstallation of the facility, subject to the permittee demonstrating to
the satisfaction of the town's Building Official and Zoning Administrator that
the work can be done in safe manner compliant with the original approved plans
and §
19.04.100. Written notice of the removal shall be served upon the person who
owns the facility within five business days of removal and all property removed
shall be preserved for the owner's pick-up, as is reasonably feasible. If the
owner cannot be identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails to
pick-up the property within 60 days, the facility shall be treated as abandoned
property.
   (D)   Removal of facilities by town. In the event the town removes a
facility in accordance with this chapter, any such removal shall be without any
liability to the town for any damage to such facility that may result from
reasonable efforts of removal. In addition to the procedures for recovering
costs of nuisance abatement, the town may collect such costs from the
performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed the amount of the
performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance with the Fairfax
Municipal Code. Unless otherwise provided herein, the town has no obligation to
store such facility. Neither the permittee, the owner, nor the operator shall
have any claim if the town damages or destroys any such facility not timely
removed by the permittee, owner, or operator after notice, or removed by the
town due to exigent circumstances.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.230 AUTHORIZATION FOR DEPARTMENTAL FORMS, RULES, AND OTHER REGULATIONS.
   The Town Council authorizes the Zoning Administrator to develop and publish
permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related
materials that the Zoning Administrator finds necessary, appropriate or useful
for processing requests, applications, permits, or any other matter under this
chapter. Without further authorization from the Town Council, the Zoning
Administrator may from time-to-time update and alter any such permit
application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related
materials as the Zoning Administrator deems necessary, appropriate or useful to
respond to regulatory, technological or other changes related to this chapter.
The Town Council authorizes the Zoning Administrator to establish other
reasonable rules and regulations, which may include, without limitation,
regular hours for appointments with applicants, as the Zoning Administrator
deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document, and manage the
application intake and permitting process.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.240 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals by applicants. Notwithstanding any provision of the Fairfax
Municipal Code to the contrary, including, but not limited to,
Chapter 17.036, any applicant may appeal a decision by the Zoning Administrator
under this chapter. The appeal must be filed within two days from the Zoning
Administrator's decision. The appeal must state in plain terms the grounds for
reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The Town Council shall serve
as the appellate authority for all appeals of all actions of the Zoning
Administrator taken pursuant to this section. The town shall provide notice for
an administrative hearing by the Town Council. The Town Council shall limit its
review to whether the project should be approved or denied in accordance with
the provisions in this chapter.
   (B)   Appeals by the general public. Any interested person or entity may
appeal any decision by the approval authority in accordance with the standards
and procedures in
Chapter 17.036, except as modified in this section. On the next available
meeting date after the appeal period lapses, or as soon as reasonably feasible
thereafter, the appellate body shall hold a public hearing to consider and act
on the application in accordance with the applicable provisions in the General
Plan, any applicable specific plan and all applicable provisions in the Fairfax
Municipal Code. Appeals from an approval will not be permitted to the extent
that the appeal is based on environmental effects from RF emissions that comply
with all applicable FCC regulations.
(Ord. 833, passed 8-7-2019)
§ 19.04.250 EFFECT ON OTHER ORDINANCES.
   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not relieve a person
from complying with any other applicable provision of the Fairfax Municipal
Code, including, but not limited to, obtaining any necessary encroachment or
building permits. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this
chapter and other provisions of the Fairfax Municipal Code, this chapter shall
control.
