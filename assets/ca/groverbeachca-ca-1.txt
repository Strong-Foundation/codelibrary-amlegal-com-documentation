DEDICATION OF LAND FEE
§ 33.065 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Cal.
Government Code § 66477. The park and recreational facilities for which
dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this subchapter are
in accordance with the park and recreation element of the General Plan of the
city adopted by the city on July 15, 1991.
(Prior Code, § 101101) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.066 REQUIREMENTS.
   At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the City Council
shall determine pursuant to §
33.0068 hereof the land required for dedication or in lieu fee payment. As a
condition of approval of a final subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider
shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the
city, for neighborhood and community park, or recreational purposes at the time
according to the standards and formula contained in this subchapter. In the
event park and recreational services are provided by a public agency other than
the city, the amount and location of land to be dedicated or fees to be paid
shall be jointly determined by the city and such public agency.
(Prior Code, § 101102) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.067 GENERAL STANDARD.
   It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience,
health, welfare, and safety require that five acres of property for each 1,000
persons residing within this city be devoted to neighborhood and community park
and recreational purposes.
(Prior Code, § 101103) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.068 FORMULA FOR DEDICATION.
   (A)   (1)   Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the
parks and recreation element of the General Plan of the city, and is to be
located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the
immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider
shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that
bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the
residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be
determined pursuant to the following formula.
      (2)   The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated has been
established pursuant to Cal. Government Code § 66477(a)(2):
 
Dwelling       Acres/Dwelling Unit
Structure Type 1990 Census (Five Acre Standard)
2-4 Plexes     2.54        0.0127
Apartments     2.30        0.0112
Mobile Homes   1.68        0.0084
Single-Family  2.79        0.0140
 
   (B)   Dedication of land shall be made in accordance with the procedures
contained in §
33.070 hereof.
   (C)   (1)   For the purposes of this section, the number of new dwelling
units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the map when in an
area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel.
      (2)   When all or part of the subdivision is located in an area zoned for
more than one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units
in the area so zoned shall equal the maximum allowed under that zone. In the
case of a condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the
number of condominium units. The term NEW DWELLING UNIT does not include
dwelling units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final
map is filed.
   (D)   The subdivider shall, without credit:
      (1)   Provide full street improvements and utility connections including,
but not limited to, curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control devices,
street trees, and sidewalks to land which is dedicated pursuant to this
section;
      (2)   Provide for fencing along the property line of that portion of the
subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land;
      (3)   Provide improved drainage through the site; and
      (4)   Provide other minimal improvements which the City Council
determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational
purposes.
   (E)   In the event proposed subdivision land is required by the General Plan
element in excess of that which is being dedicated to the city, the city may
purchase such excess land at appraised value. The appraised value shall be
based upon the estimated market value of the excess or additional land and its
improvements at the time of the subdivision’s final map acceptance.
Improvements for the excess land shall be the same as required by the city in
the tentative map approval. Purchase shall take place immediately following
final map approval.
   (F)   The land to be dedicated and purchased and the improvements to be made
pursuant to this section shall be approved by the Director of Parks and
Recreation.
(Prior Code, § 101104) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.069 FORMULA FOR FEES IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION.
   (A)   General formula.
      (1)   If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the city
parks and recreation element, to be located in whole or in part within the
proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents
of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee
equal to the value of that land, plus 50% toward the costs of off-site
improvements, prescribed for dedication in §
33.068 hereof and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of
§
33.071 hereof, such fee to be used for a local park which bears a reasonable
relationship to serve the present and future residents of the area being
subdivided.
      (2)   For the purposes of this subchapter, OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS are
defined as those improvements which would have been required if land had been
dedicated using the provisions of §
33.068.
   (B)   Fees in lieu of land, 50 parcels or less. If the proposed subdivision
contains 50 parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land
value, plus 50% toward costs of off-site improvements, of the portion of the
local park required to serve the needs of residents of the proposed
subdivision. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and
acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in subdivisions of 50
parcels or less, where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and
the land is acceptable to the City Council.
   (C)   Use of money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only for the
purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or rehabilitating
existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the
subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 101105) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.070 CRITERIA FOR DEDICATION, FEE.
   In subdivisions of more than 50 parcels, the subdivider shall both dedicate
land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the following formula.
   (A)   When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on the
city parks and recreation element as the site for a local park, such portion
shall be dedicated for local park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the
provision of §
33.071 hereof shall be paid for the value of any additional land, plus 50%
toward costs of off-site improvements, that would have been required to be
dedicated pursuant to §
33.068 hereof.
   (B)   When a major part of the local park or recreation site has already
been acquired by the city and only a small portion of land is needed from the
subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated and
a fee computed pursuant to the provision of §
33.101 hereof shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land, plus
50% toward costs of off-site improvements, which would otherwise have been
required to be dedicated pursuant to §
33.068 hereof, such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park
and recreation facility or for the improvement of other local parks and
recreational facilities in the area serving the subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 101106) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.071 AMOUNT OF FEE IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION.
   (A)   When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the value of the
amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of
land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to §
33.068, plus 50% toward costs of off-site improvements.
   (B)   The fee shall be determined by the following formula:
   (1)   DUs x pop./DU x 5 acres/1000 people x FMV/buildable acre = subtotal x
1.5 = in lieu fee, where:
         (a)   DUs = Number of Dwelling Units as defined in §
33.068;
         (b)   pop = Population per dwelling unit as defined in §
33.068;
         (c)   FMV = Fair Market Value, as determined by §
33.072; and
         (d)   Buildable acre = A typical acre of the subdivision, with a slope
less than 10% and located in other than an area on which building is excluded
because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions.
      (2)   Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be approved by
the Director of Parks and Recreation.
(Prior Code, § 101107) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.072 DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE.
   (A)   The fair market value shall be determined by the assessed value of all
the land located in the city divided by the number of acres within the city
limits. The determination shall be made immediately prior to the filing of the
final map. The subdivider shall notify the city of the expected filing date at
least six weeks prior to filing of the final map. If more than one year elapses
prior to filing the final map, the city shall prepare a new determination.
   (B)   If the subdivider objects to the determined fair market value, he or
she may appeal to the City Council who shall hear the appeal under the same
rules and obligations current for local Board of Equalization hearings, except
that the burden of proof shall lie with the subdivider.
   (C)   For the purposes of appeal, the determination of the fair market value
of a buildable acre, as defined in §
33.071, shall consider, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Approval of and conditions of the tentative subdivision map;
      (2)   The General Plan;
      (3)   Zoning;
      (4)   Property location;
      (5)   Off-site and on-site improvements facilitating use of the property;
and
      (6)   Site characteristics of the property.
   (D)   For the purposes of appeal, the City Council shall consider the
estimated or actual costs of on-site and off-site improvements rather than the
estimated 50% of land value provision defined in §
33.071.
(Prior Code, § 101108) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-5-1991)
§ 33.073 DETERMINATION OF LAND OR FEE.
   (A)   Whether the City Council accepts land dedication or elects to require
payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined
by consideration of the following:
      (1)   The natural features, access, and location of land in the
subdivision available for dedication;
      (2)   The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for
dedication;
      (3)   The feasibility of dedication;
      (4)   The compatibility of dedication with the city parks and recreation
element; and
      (5)   The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways.
   (B)   The determination of the City Council as to whether land shall be
dedicated or whether a fee shall be charged or a combination thereof shall be
final and conclusive.

recreational purposes is provided in a proposed planned development or real
estate development as defined in Cal. Business and Professions Code § 11003,

land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the City Council finds
that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards

an incorporated non-profit organization capable of dissolution only by a 100%
affirmative vote of the membership, operated under recorded land agreements
through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is automatically a member, and
each lot is subject to a charge for a proportionate share of expenses for
maintaining the facilities;
      (3)   Use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of
the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated
without the consent of the city or its successor;
      (4)   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for
park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size,

map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land as required by the City Council.
Where the City Council has determined that fees shall be paid in lieu of or in
addition to the dedication of land, the City Council shall set the in-lieu fees

approval with the formula set forth in §
33.071 and using the process for determining fair market value as set forth in
§
33.072.
      (2)   The subdivider shall pay said fees in accordance with the following

lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later.
   (C)   If such fees are not so committed, these fees, less an administrative
charge, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the
subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the
total area of all lots in the subdivision.

§ 34.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known as the “Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax
Ordinance of the City of Grover Beach” or “this subchapter.”
(Prior Code, § 10000) (Ord. 1, passed 12-28-1959)
§ 34.002 PURPOSE.

the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be
interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part
1.5 of Division 2;
(Prior Code, § 10001.2)
   (B)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.5 of Division 2;
(Prior Code, § 10001.3)
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a 1% tax and

and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the State Sales and Use Taxes;
(Prior Code, § 10001.4)
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible, be consistent with the provisions of
Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.5 of Division 2, minimize the cost of
collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
subchapter; and
(Prior Code, § 10001.5)
   (E)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will exclude the receipts of particular sales from the measure of
the sales tax imposed by this city which have been included in the measure of
the sales tax imposed by any other city and county, county other than the
county in which this city is located, or city in this state, and avoid imposing
a use tax on the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal
property in this city when the gross receipts from the sale of, or the use of,
that property has been subject to a sales or use tax by any other city and
county, county other than the county in which this city is located, or city in
the state, pursuant to a sales and use tax ordinance enacted under the
provisions of Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.5 of Division 2.
(Prior Code, § 10001.6)
(Ord. 1, passed 12-28-1959)
§ 34.003 OPERATIVE DATE, CONTRACT WITH STATE.
   This subchapter shall become operative on January 1, 1960, and prior thereto

this subchapter shall not be operative until the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract by the city and by

§ 34.004 SALES TAX.
   (A)   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a
tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate of 1% of the

(Prior Code, § 10003)
   (B)   For the purposes of this subchapter, all retail sales are consummated

place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place

rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the Board of
Equalization.

substitution of the name of the city for the word “state” when that word is
used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the
State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, or the name of the
State Treasury, or of the Constitution of the state; nor shall the name of the
city be substituted for that of the state in any section when the result of
that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city or
any agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
subchapter; and neither shall the substitution be deemed to have been made in
this section as though fully set forth herein.

any section when the result of that substitution would require action to be
taken by or against the city or any agency thereof rather than by or against
the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this subchapter; and neither shall the
substitution be deemed to have been made in those sections, including, but not
necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the
state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption
from this tax with respect to certain storage, use, or other consumption of

BUSINESS CERTIFICATE TAX
§ 34.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates, or requires, a different meaning.
   BUSINESS. Includes professions, trades, vocations, rentals, leases,
enterprises, establishments, and occupations, and all and every kind of
calling, any of which is conducted for the purpose of earning in whole, or in
part, a profit or livelihood, whether or not a profit or a livelihood actually
is earned thereby, whether paid in money, goods, labor, or otherwise.
   BUSINESS FLOOR SPACE. Rentable square feet of an office, place of business,
or lodging within the city and includes the proportionate share of the building
service areas such as lobbies, corridors, and other common areas in a building.
The rental square footage shall be computed by measuring to the inside finish
of permanent outer building walls and shall include space used by columns and
projections necessary to the building. BUSINESS FLOOR SPACE does not include
vertical penetrations through the building such as stairs, elevators, or
heating ventilation, air conditioning, utility, or telephone systems. If the
BUSINESS FLOOR SPACE is owned by the taxpayer, the business floor space will be
calculated in the same manner as above and as if the area was rented. BUSINESS
FLOOR SPACE, for purposes of defining rentable square feet of an auto
dealership or any business which the principal income is derived from selling
vehicles, shall include the building and facilities along with the area of the
dealer lot that contains the inventory of vehicles or where vehicles are
parked. The dealer lot may consist of parking areas on the same or separate lot
from the dealer’s facilities or buildings. For purposes of defining business
floor space of any business operated out of a personal residence the square
footage tax shall be based on the amount of square foot used for business as
designated in the home occupation permit application. BUSINESS FLOOR SPACE, for
purposes of calculating square footage taxes, shall be based upon the square
footage of each vending machine operated within the city and the applicant
shall submit a separate business tax certificate application for each vending
machine(s) location.
   BUSINESS LICENSE TAX. A tax payable when the city issues a business tax
certificate by every person conducting, carrying on, or managing any business
within the city but does not lease, own, occupy, or otherwise maintain an
office or place of business within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city.
   BUSINESS SQUARE FOOTAGE TAX. As defined within §
34.037.
   BUSINESS TAX. Includes both business license taxes and business square
footage taxes.
(Prior Code, § 10200) (Ord. 18-07, passed 11-6-2018)
§ 34.021 NATURE OF CERTIFICATE.
   The term BUSINESS TAX CERTIFICATE as used in this subchapter shall not be
construed to mean a permit. The taxes prescribed by this subchapter constitute
a tax for revenue purposes, and are not regulatory permit fees. The payment of
the business license tax or business square footage tax required by the
provisions of this subchapter and its acceptance by the city, and the issuance
of such certificate to any person, shall not entitle the holder thereof to
carry on any business unless they have complied with all of the requirements of
this subchapter and all other applicable provisions of the city municipal code,
or to carry on any business in any building or on any premises designated in
such certificate in the event that such building or premises are situated in a
zone or locality in which the conduct of such business is in violation of this
code.

corporation, or otherwise, shall commence or carry on any trade, calling,
profession, or occupation in the city, in this subchapter specified, without
first having procured a business tax certificate, and without complying with
any and all regulations of such trade, calling, profession, or occupation
contained in this subchapter. Any person procuring a business tax certificate
shall pay the tax as defined within this subchapter.

   (A)   Any person carrying on any trade, calling, profession, or occupation
without having a business tax certificate to do so shall be liable for the
amount of the tax imposed by this subchapter on such trade, calling,
profession, or occupation. The amount of such tax, including any penalty or
interest thereon, shall be a debt owed to the city.
   (B)   The City Attorney may file suit in the name of the city, in any court
of competent jurisdiction, for any unpaid business license tax or business
square footage tax imposed by this subchapter, within three years from the
delinquency date thereof.
   (C)   The conviction and punishment of any person for transacting any trade,
calling, profession, or occupation without a business tax certificate shall not
excuse or exempt such person from the payment of any business license tax or
business square footage tax due and unpaid at the time of such violation of the
provisions of this subchapter.

business square footage tax, or if any business tax certificate holder has
overpaid to refund the excess amount collected.
   (C)   (1)   No statements in the application shall be conclusive upon the
city, or upon any officer thereof, as to the matters therein set forth, and the

amount that may be ascertained to be due, in case such statement should be
found to be incorrect.
      (2)   If any person hereby required to make any such statement shall fail
to do so, such person shall be required to pay the business license tax or

the taxes paid to the city by any person, he or she may compute and determine
the amount required to be paid upon the basis of the facts contained in the

in the manner set forth in this subchapter.
   (C)   The Administrative Services Director, or his or her designee, shall
give written notice of a deficiency determination to each person against whom a
determination is made. The notice may be served personally or by mail. In case

   (D)   Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade this subchapter or
authorized rules and regulations, or failure to make a return, every deficiency
determination shall be made and notice thereof mailed within three years after
the last day of the month following the close of the business tax certificate
period for which the amount is determined or within three years after the
return is filed, whichever period expires later.
   (E)   If any person fails or refuses to make, within the time provided in

required by this subchapter or makes a fraudulent return or otherwise willfully
attempts to evade this subchapter, the Administrative Services Director, or his
or her designee, shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to
obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the taxes
due. As soon as the Administrative Services Director, or his or her designee,
procures facts and information upon which to base the assessment of any tax
imposed by this subchapter, he or she shall determine and assess against such
person the taxes, interest, and penalties provided for by this subchapter. When
such a determination is made, the Administrative Services Director, or his or
her designee, shall give written notice of the amount so assessed. Such
determination and notice shall be made and mailed within three years after
discovery by the Administrative Services Director, or his or her designee, of

believes that the collection of any business tax will be jeopardized by delay,

make a determination of the taxes due. The amount determined is immediately due
and payable. If the amount specified in the determination is not paid within
ten days after service of notice thereof upon the person against whom the
determination is made, the amount becomes final and delinquent, and the
delinquency penalty or penalties and the interest provided in §
34.030 shall attach to the amount of the taxes, unless a petition for
redetermination is filed within ten days.

petition for redetermination is not filed within the applicable period, the
determination becomes final and delinquent at the expiration of the period.

period, the Administrative Services Director shall reconsider the

notice of the time and place of the hearing. The Administrative Services
Director may continue the hearing from time to time as may be necessary.
   (C)   The Administrative Services Director, or his or her designee, may

hearing.

designee, upon a petition for redetermination becomes final and delinquent 15

unless at or before the filing thereof the amount found due in the original
determination is paid, or a bond or other security satisfactory to the
Administrative Services Director, or his or her designee, is filed with him or
her guaranteeing payment of any amount finally determined to be due.

by the Administrative Services Director. No refund shall be approved after
three years from the date of receipt by the city of the money to be refunded.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, a MISTAKE OF LAW OR FACT shall be
defined as follows.
      (1)   MISTAKE OF FACT. When the money was either paid by the demandant or
received by the city because of a mistake of fact when such payment or receipt
would not have been made if such mistake had not been made, then refund thereof
may be made upon a demand for refund, provided that if the mistake was wholly
or partly the city’s and the mistake was induced by an act or statement of the
demandant, or if the mistake was wholly the demandant’s and the city has made
an investigation, inspection, or examination, or done any similar work or
rendered services, the head of the department, division, or bureau may
ascertain the value or cost of such and order it deducted from the amount to be
refunded. His or her determination shall be final when approved by the
Administrative Services Director, or his or her designee, but there shall be
added thereto the amount designated for handling charges in the Master Fee
Schedule.
      (2)   MISTAKE OF LAW. When the money was either paid by the demandant or
received by the city through a mistake as to the legal necessity for making the
payment, refund thereof may be made upon a demand for refund. The demand shall
be promptly transmitted to the head of the department involved for his or her
recommendation and his or her statement of the facts upon which the
recommendation is based. The demand and recommendation shall be presented to
the City Attorney for his or her decision thereon.
   (C)   If the Administrative Services Director, or his or her designee,
determines that any overpayment has been made intentionally or by reason of
carelessness, he or she shall not allow any interest thereon.

capacity. Where the OPERATOR performs his or her functions through a managing

deemed to be TRANSIENT until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is
an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a
longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a TRANSIENT,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date of this subchapter may be considered.
(Prior Code, § 10601) (Ord. 87, passed 7-17-1967)
§ 34.057 TAX IMPOSED.

paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax
shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
transients ceasing to occupy space in the hotel/motel. If for any reason the
tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel/motel, the Tax Administrator
may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator.

   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within
the time provided in this subchapter, any report and remittance of said tax or
any portion thereof required by this subchapter, the Tax Administrator shall
proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the
Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able
to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
subchapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to
determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties
provided for by this subchapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax
Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of
address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such
notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on
the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any,
determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice
why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest,
and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why
such specified tax, interest, and penalties should not be so fixed. After such
hearing, the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and
penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days

Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days of the
serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a
time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The
findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.
Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the
service of notice.

penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is

collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in division (A) above, but only when the tax was
paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient
having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax
Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the
operator who collected the tax.

   (A)   There is hereby imposed a tax on the amounts paid for any intrastate
telephone services by every person in the city using such services. The tax
imposed by this section shall be at the rate of 1% of the charges made for such
services and shall be paid by the person paying for such services.
   (B)   As used in this section, the term CHARGES shall not include charges
for services paid for by inserting coins in coin-operated telephones, except
that where such coin-operated service is furnished for a guaranteed amount, the

charge shall be included in the base for computing the amount of tax due; nor
shall the term CHARGES include charges for any type of service or equipment
furnished by a service supplied subject to public utility regulations during
any period in which the same or similar services or equipment are also
available for sale or lease from persons other than a service supplier subject
to public utility regulations; nor shall the words TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION
SERVICES include land mobile service or maritime mobile services as defined in
47 C.F.R. § 2.1, as said section existed on January 1, 1970. The term TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATION SERVICES refers to that service which provides access to a
telephone system and the privilege of telephone quality communication with
substantially all persons having telephone stations which are part of such
telephone system. The telephone users tax is intended to, and does, apply to
all charges billed to a telephone account having a situs in the city,
irrespective of whether a particular communication service originates and/or
terminates within the city.
   (C)   The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the service
user by the person providing the intrastate telephone communication services,
or the person receiving payment for such services. The amount of the tax

services are exempt from or not subject to the tax imposed under Cal. Revenue
and Taxation Code Division 2, Part 20, or the tax imposed under I.R.C. § 4251.

§ 34.104 ELECTRICITY USERS TAX.
   (A)   There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person other than an electric
or gas corporation using electrical energy in the city. The tax imposed by this
section shall be at a rate of 1% of the charges made for such energy by an
electrical corporation providing service in the city and shall be billed to and
paid by the person using the energy. The tax applicable to electrical energy
provided by a non-utility supplier shall be determined by applying the tax rate
to the equivalent charge the service user would have incurred if the energy
used had been provided by the electrical corporation franchised by the city.
Rate schedules for this purpose shall be available from the city. Non-utility
suppliers shall install, maintain, and use an appropriate utility-type metering
system which will enable compliance with this section. CHARGES, as used in this
section, shall include charges made for:
      (1)   Metered energy; and
      (2)   Minimum charges for services, including customer charges, service

construed to mean the storage of such energy by a person in a battery owned or
possessed by him or her for use in an automobile or other machinery device
apart from the premises upon which the energy was received, provided, however,
that the term shall include the receiving of such energy for the purpose of
using it in the charging of batteries; nor shall the term include electricity
used and consumed by an electric utility supplier in the conduct of its
business; nor shall the term include the mere receiving of such energy by an
electric corporation or governmental agency at a point within the city for
resale; nor shall the term include the use of such energy in the production or
distribution of water by a water utility or a governmental agency.
   (C)   The tax imposed in this section shall be collected from the service
user by the service supplier or non-utility supplier. The tax imposed in this
section on use supplied by self-generation or from a non-utility supplier not
subject to the jurisdiction of this subchapter shall be collected and remitted
to the Tax Administrator in the manner set forth in §
34.106. The amount of tax collected by a service supplier or a non-utility
supplier in one month shall be remitted by U.S. mail to the Tax Administrator,
postmarked on or before the last day of the following month; or at the option
of the person required to collect and remit the tax, an estimate amount of tax
measured by the tax billed in the previous month, shall be remitted by U.S.
mail, to the Tax Administrator, postmarked on or before the last day of each
month.

shall be billed to and paid by the person using the gas. The tax applicable to
gas or gas transportation provided by non-utility suppliers shall be determined
by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would have

governmental agency in the conduct of its business;

the course of its public utility business; and

authorized in Cal. Vehicle Code.
   (C)   The tax imposed in this section shall be collected from the service
user by the person selling or transporting the gas. A person selling only
transportation services to a user for delivery of gas through mains or pipes
shall collect the tax from the service user based on the transportation
charges. The person selling or transporting the gas shall, on or before the
twentieth of each calendar month, commencing on the twentieth day of the
calendar month after the effective date of this subchapter, make a return to

accordance with schedules established or approved by the Tax Administrator. The
tax imposed in this section on use supplied by self-production or a non-utility
supplier not subject to the jurisdiction of this subchapter shall be collected
and remitted to the Tax Administrator in the manner set forth in §
34.106.

less than the full amount of the service charge and tax which has accrued for
the billing period, such amount and any subsequent payments by a service user
shall be applied to the utility charge first until such charge has been fully
satisfied. Any remaining balance shall be applied to taxes due. In those cases

hereby, together with the address and account number to which service is
supplied to any such exempt person. The Tax Administrator shall notify the
service supplier of termination of any person’s right to exemption hereunder,
or the change of any address to which service is supplied to any exempt person.

periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect
taxes due.

Administrator assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated
periods and demand payment of such taxes.

state insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements
and limitations contained in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.6 of
Division 2;
   (C)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax subchapter that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by

practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the State Sales and Use Taxes; and
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax subchapter that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,

tax imposed under this subchapter is expanded as a result of changes in state
or federal law, no amendment or modification of this subchapter shall be

   (C)   This subchapter establishes the administrative procedures for the
imposition, enforcement, collection, review, and appeal of civil citations and
civil fines pursuant to Cal. Government Code § 53069.4 and the city’s general
police power.
   (D)   The issuance of a civil citation under this subchapter is solely at
the city’s discretion and is one option the city has to address violations of
this code and applicable state codes. By adopting this subchapter, the city
does not intend to limit its discretion to utilize any other remedy, civil or
criminal, for such violations that the city may select in a particular case.
The procedures established in this subchapter shall be in addition to criminal,
civil, or any other legal remedies established by law that may be pursued to
address violations of this code and applicable state codes.
   (E)   Because of the serious blighting conditions that can occur affecting
health and safety, this subchapter is intended to impose strict civil liability
for all public nuisance that occur upon the subject premises.
   (F)   The city adopts this civil citation and administrative hearing program
in order to achieve the following goals:
      (1)   To protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the city;
      (2)   To gain compliance with this code and applicable state codes, as
well as other ordinances and regulations in a timely and efficient manner;
      (3)   To encourage voluntary and complete compliance with the provisions
of this code and applicable state codes, and to eliminate public nuisances for
the protection and benefit of the entire community;
      (4)   To provide for an administrative hearing process to appeal the
imposition of civil citations and civil fines;
      (5)   To provide a method to hold persons responsible when they fail or
refuse to comply with the provisions of the city municipal code or applicable
provisions of state codes, other ordinances or regulations, or terms and
conditions imposed on licenses, permits, or entitlements issued or approved by
the city; and
      (6)   To minimize the expense and delay where the sole remedy is to
pursue responsible parties in the civil or criminal justice system.

(Prior Code, § 1403) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 37.031 BUILDING VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   When a notice of violation is issued for a building violation, a 30-
calendar day correction period shall be allowed for the correction of the
violation and the responsible person shall correct the violation within that
period. Notwithstanding the provisions of §
37.030, no responsible person for a building violation shall be liable for a
civil fine unless the violation continues after the 30 calendar days allowed
for its correction, plus any extension, and a civil citation is issued
containing a notice of failure to correct. The 30-calendar day correction
period shall not apply to a building code violation if the violation exists as
a result of, or to facilitate, the illegal cultivation of cannabis.
   (B)   The responsible person receives a notice of violation for a building
violation may request an extension of the correction period, provided that a
request is filed with the Director before the 30-calendar day correction period
ends. The Director may, in his or her discretion, grant a reasonable extension
of the time period to correct the violation if the responsible person has
supplied substantial evidence showing that the correction cannot reasonably be
made within the 30-calendar day period. The filing for such an extension does
not, unless granted, extend the 30-calendar day correction period or any other
time periods set by this subchapter.
   (C)   If a building violation has not been corrected by the end of the
correction period, the enforcement officer has authority to issue to the
responsible person a civil citation containing a notice of failure to correct.
The responsible person to whom the notice of failure to correct is issued shall
be liable for and shall pay to the city the civil fine or fines described in
the civil citation, which civil fine or fines shall be due on the date of
issuance of the civil citation. Additional civil citations may be issued and
additional civil fines imposed for every day the violation continues
uncorrected from the date of issuance of the civil citation.

which the responsible person can send the civil fine or request for
administrative hearing or civil fine deposit waiver to the city.

shall not constitute grounds for dismissal of the civil citation.
(Prior Code, § 1405) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 37.033 SERVICE.
   A civil citation may be served by any one of the following methods.
   (A)   Personal service. An enforcement officer shall attempt to locate and
personally serve the responsible person and obtain the signature of the
responsible person on the civil citation. If the responsible person served
refuses or fails to sign the civil citation, the failure or refusal to sign
shall not affect the validity of the civil citation or of the subsequent
proceedings.
   (B)   Service by mail.
      (1)   If the enforcement officer is unable to locate or personally serve
the responsible person, the civil citation shall be served by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, with a declaration under penalty of perjury of service by mail
executed by the person mailing the civil citation.
      (2)   The civil citation shall be addressed to the responsible person at
the address shown on the last equalized property tax assessment rolls for the
county for a building or property-related violation, or to any address known
for the responsible person for all other violations. Service by mail shall be
deemed to be effective service on the date it is mailed and shall not affect
the validity of the civil citation or of the subsequent proceedings.
   (C)   Service by posting. If the enforcement officer is unsuccessful in
either personal service or service by mail, the civil citation shall be posted
in a conspicuous place on the real property where the violation occurs for a
building or property related violation. Such posting shall be deemed to be
effective service on the date of posting and shall not affect the validity of
the civil citation or of the subsequent proceedings.
(Prior Code, § 1406) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 37.034 DUE DATE.
   (A)   Civil fines are due on the date the civil citation is issued, except
civil fines for building violations shall be due on the date the second civil
citation is issued containing the notice of failure to correct.
   (B)   A civil fine shall be late if not received by the city within 30
calendar days of the date the civil citation was issued.
   (C)   If a responsible person requests an administrative hearing and has
received a waiver of civil fine deposit and the hearing officer upholds the
civil citation, the civil fine shall be due on the date the notice of decision
is personally delivered or mailed to the responsible person.
(Prior Code, § 1408) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 37.035 PAYMENT.
   (A)   A civil fine shall be received by the City Administrative Services
Department within 30 calendar days of its due date.
   (B)   Payment of a civil fine shall not excuse the responsible person from
correcting the code violation(s). The issuance of a civil citation and/or
payment of a civil fine does not bar the city from taking any other enforcement
action regarding a code violation that is not corrected, including issuing
additional civil citations, and/or filing civil or criminal complaints.
(Prior Code, § 1409) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 37.036 COLLECTION.
   (A)   Civil fines, interest, penalties, reinspection fees, and/or
administrative costs shall become a debt owing to the city and a personal
obligation of the responsible person cited.
   (B)   The city, at its discretion, may pursue any and all legal and
equitable remedies for the collection of unpaid civil fines, administrative
charges, interest, and penalties. Pursuit of one remedy does not preclude the
pursuit of any other remedies until the total amount of the civil fines,
interest, and penalties owed by a person under this subchapter have been
collected.
   (C)   The city may refuse to issue, extend, or renew any city permit,
license, or other city approval to any person who has unpaid delinquent civil
fines, interest, penalties, liens, or assessments due under this subchapter
related to the permit, license, or approval.
   (D)   The city may suspend any permit, license, or land use approval issued
to a person who has unpaid civil fines related to the permit, license, or
approval totaling $500 or more that have been delinquent for over 30 calendar
days. The suspension shall become effective 20 calendar days after notice of
the suspension is placed by the Director in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the person and shall continue until the delinquency is paid in
full. The person may request an administrative hearing pursuant to the
provisions of this subchapter on the issue of civil fine delinquency only if
the request is filed with the Director before the 20-calendar day period ends.
Continuing to operate under a suspended permit, license, or land use approval
shall be grounds for revocation of the permit, license, or land use approval.
Revocation may be made by the same city department or commission issuing or
granting the permit, license, or land use approval upon the same notice and
hearing requirements for the initial issue or grant, or upon such other
procedures and notice requirements if controlled by another provision of this
code. In no event shall revocation occur upon less than ten calendar days’
written notice.
   (E)   It shall be unlawful for a responsible person to fail to pay any civil
fine, interest, penalty, reinspection fee, or administrative charges imposed
pursuant to this subchapter. The City Attorney, at his or her discretion, may
issue a criminal citation or complaint for an infraction to any responsible
person who fails to make such a payment. The criminal fine for this violation
shall be a mandatory minimum of $100.
   (F)   Any violation of this code shall constitute a public nuisance. To
compel compliance, the city may seek to abate the nuisance and collect the
costs incurred by means of a nuisance abatement lien and/or special assessment
against the property where a property-related violation occurred. Any unpaid
delinquent civil fines, interest, penalties, reinspection fees, or
administrative charges may be recovered as part of any such lien or special
assessment against the property of the responsible person who is the owner of
the property where the violation occurred pursuant to Cal. Government Code §§
38773.1 and 38773.5. In any judicial action, administrative proceeding, or
special proceeding or action of any kind to abate a nuisance, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to recovery of attorney’s fees and court costs. The
recovery of attorney’s fees is limited solely to causes of action directly
associated with the abatement of a public nuisance. In no action,
administrative hearing, or special proceeding shall an award of attorney’s fees
to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorney’s fees incurred
by the city in the action or proceeding. Such attorney’s fees shall be
recoverable as costs of abatement.
   (G)   To recover any delinquent civil fines, interest, penalties,
reinspection fees, or administrative charges as a nuisance abatement lien and/
or special assessment against the property where a property-related violation
occurred, the city’s Administrative Services Director at his or her discretion,
take the following steps:
      (1)   Submit to and receive from the City Council a resolution certifying
the amounts of the liens and special assessments sought to be collected from
each property owner;
      (2)   Request the County Recorder to record a notice of any liens, or
special assessments, and send the Recorder the resolution certifying the
amounts;
      (3)   Request the County Tax Collector to collect any special assessments
certified by the City Council; and
      (4)   Take all other necessary action to enforce collection of any liens
or special assessments provided for in this subchapter.
   (H)   The Administrative Services Director may pursue the lien and special
assessment remedies whether or not the city is pursuing any other action to
terminate an ongoing code violation that was the basis for the civil fine.
   (I)   All civil citations shall contain a notice that unpaid civil fines,
interest, penalties, reinspection fees, and administrative charges are subject
to the assessment and lien collection procedures of this section. The lien or
assessment shall be imposed on the date the civil citation for the code
violation is issued to the responsible person and becomes effective upon the
recording of a notice of lien or assessment by the County Recorder. This notice
shall satisfy the notice requirements of Cal. Government Code §§ 38773.1 and
38773.5, when a civil citation is personally served on the responsible person.
In addition, the City Administrative Services Director shall send notice by
first class mail stating the date, time, and location of the meeting to each
property owner listed in the proposed resolution at least ten calendar days
before the City Council considers the resolution and certifies the amounts of
the liens and special assessments.
   (J)   A responsible person may contest the amount and/or validity of any
lien or assessment for a civil fine at the public hearing to certify the amount
of the lien or assessment by the City Council pursuant to the provisions of
this subchapter. Such contests shall be limited to the issue of the amount and/
or validity of the lien or assessment, and may not consider whether the
underlying Code violation occurred. Pursuit of such a contest by a responsible
person is necessary to exhaust the administrative remedies concerning a legal
challenge to the validity of any such lien or assessment.
   (K)   The parent or legal guardian of a responsible person who is a minor
shall be liable for any civil fines imposed upon the minor pursuant to the
provisions of this subchapter. Any such civil fines may be collected from the
minor, parent, or guardian.
(Prior Code, § 1410) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 37.037 PRELIMINARY REVIEW.
   (A)   A responsible person may request a preliminary civil citation review.
The request for a preliminary civil citation review shall be actually received
by the Community Development Department within ten calendar days of the date of
issuance of the civil citation.
   (B)   To obtain a preliminary civil citation review, the responsible person
shall submit to the Community Development Department a copy of the civil
citation along with a signed written request for a preliminary civil citation
review stating the reasons why no violation occurred or why the responsible
person cited is not a responsible person for the violation. Attached to the
signed written request for a preliminary civil citation review shall be copies
of any evidence that the responsible person would like considered during the
preliminary civil citation review. All requests for a preliminary civil
citation review shall be date stamped upon receipt by the city.
   (C)   A city employee designated by the Director shall conduct the
preliminary civil citation review. The reviewer shall not be the enforcement
officer who issued the civil citation. The purpose of the preliminary civil
citation review is to uncover and cancel any mistakenly-issued civil citations
due to errors that are easily verifiable, and not to resolve factual disputes
concerning the violation that is the subject of the civil citation.
   (D)   The preliminary civil citation review shall consist of a review of the
citation, the written statement and any other evidence submitted at the time of
the request by the responsible person and, at the discretion of the reviewer,
any other related information. The review shall be decided within three
business days of receipt of the request.
   (E)   The responsible person shall be notified of the results of the
preliminary civil citation review by a written notice of decision. The notice
of decision shall be forwarded to the responsible person by mail, email, or in
person.
   (F)   A request for preliminary civil citation review does not extend any
time periods for compliance, including the civil fine due date, the time any
correction period ends, or the time to request an administrative hearing.
   (G)   If the conclusion of the preliminary civil citation review is that the
civil citation was mistakenly issued or that the responsible person was not
responsible for the violation, the citation shall be canceled.
(Prior Code, § 1411) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 37.038 WAIVER OF PAYMENT.
   (A)   A responsible person requesting an administrative hearing may also
request at the same time a hardship waiver of the civil fine payment. To seek
such a waiver and obtain an administrative hearing on the request, the
responsible person shall file with the city the signed written request form
contained on the reverse side of the civil citation, check the box indicating
this request, and attach a statement of the grounds for the request. The
procedure governing the filing of such requests shall be the same as provided
in §
37.039(A)(2).
   (B)   The person requesting the waiver bears the burden of establishing by
substantial evidence that he or she does not have the financial ability to pay
the deposit of the civil fine. The responsible person shall personally appear
at the administrative hearing on the request and a nonappearance shall
constitute an abandonment of the request.
   (C)   (1)   The request shall be heard at the administrative hearing on the
contest of the civil citation. At the conclusion of the administrative hearing
on the waiver request, the hearing officer shall issue a notice of decision
that the fine deposit is or is not waived.
      (2)   The hearing officer shall then proceed with the hearing on the
contest of the civil citation. If the civil citation is upheld by the hearing
officer, the fine payment shall be paid within 30 days after the decision is
made by the hearing officer.
   (D)   A hearing officer decision on the waiver request is final and not
subject to an appeal pursuant to §
37.040.
(Prior Code, § 1412) (Ord. 22-03, passed 4-11-2022)
§ 37.039 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.
   (A)   Hearing request.
      (1)   A responsible person may contest a civil citation by filing a
request for an administrative hearing, except that an administrative hearing of
a building violation may not be requested unless and until a second civil
citation is issued containing a notice of failure to correct. To obtain an
administrative hearing, the responsible person shall fill out and file a signed
written request form obtained from the city’s Department of Community
Development and indicate the grounds for contesting the civil citation and/or
civil fine. A responsible person may contest the civil citation by denying that
a violation occurred, by denying that it was not corrected within the
correction period, if applicable, or by denying that the responsible person
cited is a responsible person for the violation.
      (2)   To be effective and complete, the city must actually receive the
request within 30 calendar days of the date the citation was issued. Where the
responsible person mails a request, the request shall be deemed filed on the
date actually received by the city.
      (3)   The responsible person shall appear at the administrative hearing
on the date and at the time and place specified in writing by the city by the
Director of Community Development. Failure to personally attend the
administrative hearing shall be considered a nonappearance. Nonappearance by
the responsible person shall constitute an abandonment of the request unless
the administrative hearing was continued pursuant to the provisions of this
subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 1413)
   (B)   Hearing procedure.
      (1)   A hearing officer shall conduct administrative hearings in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.
      (2)   Hearings shall be conducted by a hearing officer either:
         (a)   On the date and at the time and place specified in writing by
the city;
         (b)   On the date designated as a continued hearing date, as specified
hereinbelow; or
         (c)   On a date set by the Director at least ten calendar days, but
not more than 30 calendar days, after the responsible person requests an
administrative hearing pursuant to §
37.038. At least ten calendar days’ written notice thereof shall be given to
the responsible person.
      (3)   The Director shall ensure that the pertinent civil citation records
are delivered to the hearing officer, including information showing all civil
fine deposits or waivers granted.
      (4)   At the administrative hearing, the Director shall make available to
the responsible person copies of any additional reports concerning the civil
citation that are provided to the hearing officer.
      (5)   The responsible person shall be given the opportunity to testify
and to present evidence relevant to financial hardship, the code violation
specified in the citation, or the fact that all fines have been paid. A parent
or legal guardian of a responsible person who is a juvenile under 18 years of
age shall accompany the responsible person at the administrative hearing or the
contest of the civil citation or request for waiver of the civil fine deposit
shall be deemed abandoned.
      (6)   The civil citation, and any other reports prepared by the
enforcement officer, or prepared at his or her request concerning the code
violation, any attempted correction of the code violation, or civil fine
payments that are provided to the hearing officer shall be accepted by the
hearing officer as prima facie evidence of the code violation and the facts
stated in such documents.
      (7)   (a)   The hearing officer, Director, or City Attorney may continue
an administrative hearing if a request is made by the responsible person, or
the responsible person’s representative, or the representative of the city,
upon a showing of good cause.
         (b)   All continuance requests shall either be made in person at the
administrative hearing or by written request received by the department at
least 24 hours before the administrative hearing date. If the continuance is
granted, a new administrative hearing date shall be set within 45 calendar days
and noted on the notice of decision.
         (c)   If the continuance is denied, the administrative hearing shall
proceed as scheduled, and, if the responsible person is not present, the
contest of the civil citation or request for civil fine payment waiver shall be
deemed abandoned in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. The
decision on the continuance request is final and the notice of decision shall
either be delivered personally to the responsible person or the representative
if present or be mailed or emailed to the responsible person by the department.
      (8)   The administrative hearing shall be conducted informally, and the
legal rules of evidence need not be followed. The hearing officer does not have
the authority to issue a subpoena.
      (9)   The failure of the responsible person to appear at the
administrative hearing, unless continued in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter, shall constitute an abandonment of the request for waiver of
the civil fine payment and/or contest of the civil citation, and a failure to
exhaust administrative remedies concerning the code violation(s) as set forth
in the civil citation. The responsible person’s failure to appear shall be
noted on the notice of decision by the hearing officer and delivered to the
responsible person either in person or by mail.
(Prior Code, § 1414)
   (C)   Hearing decision. After consideration of all the evidence and
testimony submitted at the administrative hearing, the hearing officer shall
issue a written decision to either waive the civil fine payment, not waive the
civil fine payment, uphold the civil citation, or cancel the civil citation.
The hearing officer has no discretion or authority to reduce or modify a civil

employed by the Police Department are hereby empowered to enforce, and are
charged with the duty of enforcing, any and all provisions of this code or of
any other ordinance of the city, including the power to arrest for such
violations in accordance with the laws of the state, together with such other
powers as are conferred upon them by the city. The Police Chief may authorize
employees of the Police Department, excepting clerks, stenographers, and others
whose duties do not fall within the scope of law enforcement services, to
enforce any and all provisions of the statutes of the state, of this code, or
of any other ordinance of the city where the violation of such provision or
provisions would constitute a misdemeanor or an infraction, including the power
to cite for such violations in accordance with the laws of the state.
(Prior Code, § 1203)
   (B)   Enforcement officers.
      (1) Training requirements. Before any such officer or employee may
exercise criminal citation authority pursuant to this section, that officer or
employee must complete an enforcement-training program established at the
discretion of the Chief of the City Police Department. The training program
shall be designed to instruct officers and employees regarding:
         (a)   The provisions of this code to be enforced;
         (b)   The evidentiary prerequisites to proper prosecution for
violations thereof;
         (c)   The procedural requirements of citations, including completion
of the forms, processing, and amendment of citation forms; and
         (d)   The limitations attendant thereto.
      (2)   Citation authority. The City Manager may appoint employees of the
city from departments other than the Police Department as enforcement officers
who shall have the same powers to enforce and duty to enforce the provisions of
the city municipal code as people designated in division (A) above.
      (3)   Delegation. An officer or employee designated in division (B)(2)
above has the authority to appoint employees to assist in the enforcement
responsibilities. Such employees shall likewise have the authority to issue
criminal citations following the written confirmation by the City Manager of

authority pursuant to this section may, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code §§ 836.5,

person where any such citation officer has probable cause to believe that the
person to be issued the citation has violated a provision of this code in the
citation officer’s presence, which the citation officer had the discretionary
duty to enforce, and therefore, has committed a misdemeanor or infraction.
      (5)   Release on written promise to appear. A citation officer exercising
the authority pursuant to this section may release the person to be issued a
citation on his or her written promise to appear in court. The citation officer
shall under no circumstances take the person to be issued a citation into
custody.
      (6)   Refusal to sign. In the event that the person to be issued a
citation refuses to provide his or her written promise to appear in court, a
citation officer may summon a city police officer and request that such police
officer take the person into custody. If the person demands to be taken before
a magistrate, the citation officer may summon a city police officer and request
that such police officer take the person into custody or seek assistance of the
City Attorney and request that a complaint be prepared and filed against that
person.
      (7)   Filing and maintenance files. Citation officers having a duty to
enforce the provisions of this code, and who exercise the authority to issue a
citation pursuant to this section, shall maintain a file of executed citations,
issued under division (B)(4) above, any citations for misdemeanors shall be
forwarded to the City Attorney’s office for issuance of a complaint and filing
with the appropriate magistrate.
      (8)   Additional authority. Nothing in this section shall be considered
to limit any authority otherwise vested in the named officers and employees,

administrative costs, including interest thereon, is paid in full.

§ 37.086 PROCESSING OF APPLICATION.
   Prior to final approval of a building permit for a residential dwelling unit
or units which is located in whole or in part in an attendance area where a
school has been determined to be overcrowded pursuant to this subchapter and
for which the City Council has approved the school district’s plan to solve
overcrowding, the applicant shall present to the Community Development Director
evidence of one of the following:
   (A)   Payment to the school district of the fees required by resolution of
the City Council adopted pursuant to §
37.085 which is in effect at the time the applicant applies for a building
permit;
   (B)   An agreement in writing with the affected school district by which the
applicant agrees to dedicate to the school district and the school district
agrees to accept land to be used to relieve the overcrowding in the district’s
schools as an alternative to payment of fees under division (A) above;
   (C)   An agreement in writing with the affected school district by which the
applicant agrees to both dedicate land and pay fees to the school district and
the school district agrees to accept the combination of dedicated land and fees
to relieve the overcrowding in the district’s schools as an alternative to only
the payment of fees under division (A) above and to only the dedication of land
under division (B) above. The amount of the fees shall be determined by the
City Council pursuant to §
37.085;
   (D)   A written statement of the applicant, with supporting documentation,
that there are specific overriding fiscal, economic, social, or environmental
factors benefitting the city which will justify the approval of such
residential development without compliance with the fee payment or land
dedication requirements of this subchapter.
      (1)   If the applicant provides such a statement of overriding factors
under this division (D), the Community Development Director shall place the
matter on the agenda of the City Council for public hearing to be held not less
than 45 days after receipt of the statement, and shall give the school district
at least ten days written notice of the hearing along with a copy of the
statement.
      (2)   If after public hearing, the City Council agrees that overriding
factors benefitting the city justify approval without the payment of fees or
dedication of land, it shall direct the Community Development Director to
continue processing the application. If the City Council finds that there are
not sufficient overriding factors, it shall direct the Community Development
Director to take no further action to process the application until the
documentation required by divisions (A), (B), or (C) above has been provided.
      (3)   The Community Development Director shall refuse to grant final
approval to a building permit for a residential dwelling unit which is within a
school attendance area in which the City Council has found that conditions of
overcrowding exist and for which the City Council has approved the school
district’s plan to solve overcrowding, until the applicant has complied with
this section.
   (E)   An agreement with the school district for payment of fees pursuant to
§
37.088(G), along with evidence of payment to the school district of the fee
specified in such agreement.
(Prior Code, § 10955) (Ord. 84-2, passed 3-19-1984; Ord. 86-1, passed 3-3-1986)
§ 37.087 USE OF LAND, FEES.
   Except as provided in §
37.088(G), all fees collected by a school district pursuant to this subchapter
shall be used only for the purpose of providing interim school facilities as
defined in §
37.080.

§ 37.088 EXEMPTIONS.
   Residential development shall be exempt from the requirements of this
subchapter when it consists of any one or more of the following:
   (A)   Any modification or remodeling of an existing legally-established
dwelling unit;
   (B)   The proposed development is located within a redevelopment area
designated by a redevelopment agency pursuant to the Community Redevelopment
Law, and Cal. Health and Safety Code §§ 33000 et seq.;
   (C)   A condominium project converting an existing apartment building into
condominiums where no new dwelling units are added or created;

damaged by fire, explosion, an act of God, or other accident or catastrophe;
   (E)   Any rebuilding of a historical building recognized, acknowledged, and
designated as such by the City Planning Commission or City Council;
   (F)   Any residential development where the City Council finds there are
specific overriding fiscal, economic, social, or environmental factors
benefitting the city which, in the sole judgment of the City Council would
justify the approval of such development without the payment of fees or
dedication of land; and
   (G)   Any residential development where the developer and the school
district have entered into a written agreement to mitigate the impacts of
overcrowding by providing to the school district, for its use for permanent or
interim facilities as it deems best, fees and/or land at least equal in value
to the amounts required by this subchapter for interim facilities. The City
Council finds that such a mitigation measure is a specific overriding fiscal,
social, and economic factor benefitting the city which justifies approval of
any such development without compliance with the interim facilities fee payment
requirements of this subchapter and without requirement for the hearing process
specified in §
37.087(D). This exemption shall also be applicable to previously approved
residential developments in the event that the payor of any fee charged for
interim facilities pursuant to this subchapter enters into a written agreement
with the school district authorizing use of such funds for permanent
facilities.

(Prior Code, § 10975) (Ord. 84-2, passed 3-19-1984)
§ 37.091 TERMINATION.
   As soon as overcrowding conditions cease to exist or reasonable methods of
mitigating conditions of overcrowding are feasible, the school district shall
immediately notify the City Council. Upon receiving such notice, or upon the
City Council’s determination that overcrowding conditions cease to exist or
that reasonable methods for mitigating conditions of overcrowding are feasible,
the City Council shall cease the requirement of fees or land dedication
required by this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 10980) (Ord. 84-2, passed 3-19-1984)
§ 37.092 ACCOUNTING, ANNUAL REPORT.
   Any school district receiving funds or land pursuant to this subchapter
shall maintain a separate trust account for any funds paid and shall file a
report and an independent audit with the City Council on the balance in the
account at the end of the previous fiscal year and the facilities leased,
purchased, or constructed during the previous fiscal year. In addition, the
reports shall specify which attendance areas will continue to be overcrowded
when the fall term begins and when and where conditions of overcrowding will no
longer exist. Such report shall be filed no later than three months following
the close of each fiscal year of the school district and shall be filed more
frequently if requested by the City Council. The city may, at any reasonable

WATER WELLS
§ 50.015 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to protect the health, safety,
and general welfare of the people of the state by ensuring that the
groundwaters of the state will not be polluted or contaminated.
   (B)   To this end, minimum requirements are contained in this subchapter for
construction, reconstruction, repair, and destruction of water wells, cathodic
protection wells, and monitoring wells.

Editor’s note:
   Cal. Water Code § 13801(b) refers to well construction, maintenance, and
abandonment
    standards. Since the Department of Water Resources’ “Water Well Standards”
defines an
    abandoned well in terms of an undesirable condition, best remedied by
destruction of the well, this
    usage is followed in these regulations.
§ 50.016 DEFINITIONS.
   Except as otherwise required by the context of this subchapter, the terms
used in this subchapter shall have the same meaning as in Cal. Water Code
Chapter 10 of Division 7, and the Department of Water Resources Bulletin 74-81,

§ 50.019 VARIANCES.
   The enforcement agency shall have the power under the following specified
conditions to grant a variance from any provision of the standards referenced
above and to prescribe alternative requirements in their place.
   (A)   Special circumstances. There must be, in a specific case, a special
circumstance where practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship would result
from the strict interpretation and enforcement of any standard.
   (B)   Intent of subchapter not compromised. The granting of such a variance
is consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 5508) (Ord. 89-16, passed 1-2-1990)
§ 50.020 SPECIAL GROUNDWATER PROTECTION.
   The enforcement agency may designate areas where groundwater quality
problems are known to exist and where a well will penetrate more than one
aquifer. The enforcement agency may require in these designated areas special
well seal(s) to prevent mixing of water from several aquifers. Where an
applicant proposes well construction, reconstruction, or destruction work in
such an area, the enforcement agency may require the applicant to provide a
report prepared by a registered geologist or registered civil engineer (Cal.
Business and Professions Code §§ 7850 and 6762 respectively) that identifies
all strata containing poor quality water and recommends the location and
specifications of the seal or seals needed to prevent the entrance of poor-
quality water or its migration into other aquifers.
(Prior Code, § 5509) (Ord. 89-16, passed 1-2-1990)
§ 50.021 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Inspections. The enforcement agency shall make an inspection of the
annular seal construction work. It may make an initial inspection of each
proposed drilling site, an inspection at the completion of the work, and
inspections at such other times as it deems appropriate.
      (1)   Initial inspection. Upon receipt of an application, the enforcement
agency may make an inspection of the drilling site prior to the issuance of a
well permit. The purpose of this inspection is to determine whether there are
any site conditions such that the enforcement agency shall do the following:
         (a)   Relocation of drilling site. Require relocation of the drilling
site should the location shown on the permit application be too close to
potential sources of pollution; and
         (b)   Additional conditions. Set additional conditions if needed to
remediate any previously unknown groundwater quality protection problems.
      (2)   Inspection of well seal. The enforcement agency shall inspect the
annular space grout depth prior to the sealing.
         (a)   Required notice. The enforcement agency shall be notified by the
well driller a minimum of 24 hours prior to sealing the annular space. Drillers
who anticipate completing a well in less than one day shall notify the
enforcement agency 24 hours prior to commencement of drilling and provide the
anticipated time to commence the sealing of the annular space.
         (b)   Should enforcement agency fail to be present. If the enforcement
agency wishes to allow a seal to be tremied or placed without inspection, the
driller shall seal the well in accordance with the standards of this subchapter
and any permit conditions. No seal shall be tremied or placed until permission
to proceed is given.
      (3)   Final inspection. If requested by the enforcement agency, the
driller shall notify the enforcement agency within seven days of the completion
of their work at each drilling site. The enforcement agency may make a final
inspection after completion of the work to determine whether the well was
completed in accordance with this subchapter.
      (4)   Waiver of inspections. The enforcement agency may waive inspections
should any of the following conditions exist.
         (a)   Well inspected by other agencies. Inspections may be waived
where the work will be inspected by the staff of the State Regional Water
Quality Control Board or the State Department of Health Services if these
designated agencies will inspect and report to the enforcement agency on all
drilling features required by the standards.
         (b)   Monitoring wells under specified conditions. Inspections may be
waived for monitoring wells that will penetrate only aquifers containing
degraded waters or will penetrate only formations that normally contain no
water.
         (c)   Drilling sites known to have no threats to groundwater quality.
Initial inspections may be waived when the drilling site is well known to the
enforcement agency staff and it is known that no significant threats to
groundwater quality exist in the area.
(Prior Code, § 5510)
   (B)   Right of entry and inspection. Representatives of the enforcement
agency shall have the right to enter upon any premises at all reasonable times
to make inspections and tests for the purpose of such enforcement and
administration. If any such premises are occupied, he or she shall first
present proper credentials and demand entry. If the same is unoccupied, he or
she shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person
having charge or control of same and demand entry. If such entry is refused, he
or she shall have recourse to such remedies as are provided by law to secure
entry.

   (A)   It is hereby found and determined that the periodic collection of
garbage, wet garbage, refuse, or rubbish, hereinafter collectively referred to
as “solid waste,” from all places in the city benefits all occupants of places
and premises in the city, and in nearly every case the person who is the
occupant of any place in or from which solid wastes are created, accumulated,
or produced has already contracted for other municipal services to the
premises.
   (B)   Solid waste disposal service subject to the limitations herein noted
shall be provided by the city, and it shall be mandatory for all places and
premises in the city in or on which garbage or other solid waste is created,
accumulated, or produced to use the city’s collection service; provided,
however, that where the total amount of water used over a two-month period by a
residence does not exceed 150 cubic feet, that residence shall be exempted from
such mandatory requirements upon application to the city.
   (C)   For the purposes of establishing liability and responsibility for the
payment of fees and charges hereinafter referred to, the party responsible for
payment for garbage services is deemed to be the person who has heretofore
applied or will hereafter apply for water service to each place or premises
within the city and all fees and charges hereinafter referred to shall be
collected directly by the authorized contract agent of the city.

all times be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works. The
person in charge of any vehicle used to haul refuse, garbage, or rubbish under
the permission granted by the provisions of this section shall, on request from
the custodian of, or person in charge at, the city disposal site exhibit
satisfactory evidence showing that such refuse, garbage, or rubbish accumulated
in, and was hauled from, the city, and that the producer thereof is a resident
of the city. The permission granted by the provisions of this section shall not
include the right to haul and dispose of dead animals, the refuse from the
construction, demolition, or alteration of buildings, old automobile bodies or
frames, nor any refuse or rubbish originating in a commercial establishment
where the quantity exceeds one cubic yard.
      (2)   The Council is hereby authorized to provide by resolution that any
person who shall haul his or her own refuse, garbage, or rubbish and dispose of
the same at the city disposal site pay the contractor holding a contract from
the city a fee for such privilege. The rate of such fee shall be established by
such resolution and may be changed from time to time by the Council by
resolution duly adopted by the Council.

collect, remove, or haul garbage, refuse, or rubbish over the streets of the
city during such time as such contract agent has a contract with the city for
the collection and disposal of the same; provided, however, that this section
shall not apply to producer hauling as provided in §

Inspector to haul and dispose of the same; and provided further, that the
provisions of this section shall not apply during any week set apart and
approved by the City Council as a “Clean-up Week;” nor shall this section apply
to gardeners, landscapers, or building contractors in connection with the
removal of rubbish or refuse resulting from their work and incidental thereto.

§ 52.42 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Violation of any provision of this subchapter shall constitute grounds
for issuance of a notice of violation and assessment of a fine by a City
Enforcement Official or representative. Enforcement actions under this
subchapter are issuance of an administrative citation and assessment of a fine.
The city’s procedures on imposition of administrative fines as specified in §§
37.015 and
37.016, and
37.030 through
37.040 are hereby incorporated in their entirety, as modified from time to
time, and shall govern the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review of
administrative citations issued to enforce this chapter and any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant to this subchapter, except as otherwise indicated
in this subchapter.
   (B)   Other remedies allowed by law may be used, including civil action or
prosecution as misdemeanor or infraction. The city may pursue civil actions in
the state courts to seek recovery of unpaid administrative citations. The city
may choose to delay court action until such time as a sufficiently large number
of violations or cumulative size of violations exist such that court action is
a reasonable use of city staff and resources. In any judicial action,
administrative proceeding, or special proceeding or action of any kind to
enforce this subchapter, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recovery of
attorney’s fees. The recovery of attorney’s fees is limited solely to causes of
action directly associated with the enforcement of this subchapter. In no
action, administrative hearing, or special proceeding shall an award of
attorney’s fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable
attorney’s fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding. Such
attorney’s fees shall be recoverable as costs of enforcement of this
subchapter.
   (C)   (1)   Enforcement pursuant to this chapter may be undertaken by the

   (D)   (1)   City enforcement officials, and/or their designees are
specifically empowered to monitor compliance with this subchapter through
compliance reviews, route reviews, investigation of complaints, and an
inspection program. City enforcement officials, and/or their designee, may also
monitor compliance with the subchapter randomly. Section
52.41 and GBMC § 1400.1 establishes city’s right to conduct inspections and
investigations.
      (2)   The city may issue an official notification to notify regulated
entities of its obligations under this subchapter.
      (3)    (a)   For incidences of prohibited container contaminants found in
containers, the city, or its designee, will issue an informational notice of
contamination to any generator or responsible party found to have prohibited
container contaminants in a container.
         (b)   Such notice will be provided via a cart tag or other
communication immediately upon identification of the prohibited container
contaminants or within five days after determining that a violation has
occurred. If the city, or its designee, observes prohibited container
contaminants in a responsible party’s containers on more than two consecutive
occasion(s), the city may assess contamination processing fees or contamination
penalties on the generator.
      (4)   With the exception of violations of contamination of container
contents addressed under division (J) below, the city shall issue a notice of
violation requiring compliance within 60 days of issuance of the notice.
      (5)   (a)   Absent compliance by the respondent within the deadline set
forth in the notice of violation, the city shall commence an action to impose
penalties, via an administrative citation and fine, pursuant to §§
37.015 and
37.016, and
37.030 through
37.040 and this subchapter.
         (b)   Notices shall be sent to “owner” at the official address of the

address is available, to the owner at the address of the multi-family premises
or commercial premises or to the responsible party for the collection services,
depending upon available information.
   (E)   The following factors shall be used when imposing penalties for
violations:
      (1)   The nature, circumstances, and severity of the violation(s);
      (2)   The violator’s ability to pay;
      (3)   The willfulness of the violator’s misconduct;
      (4)   Whether the violator took measures to avoid or mitigate violations
of this subchapter;
      (5)   Evidence of any economic benefit resulting from the violation(s);
      (6)   The deterrent effect of the penalty on the violator; and/or
      (7)   Whether the violation(s) were due to conditions outside the control
of the violator.
   (F)   The city may extend the compliance deadlines set forth in a notice of
violation issued in accordance with this section if it finds that there are
extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the respondent that make
compliance within the deadlines impracticable, including the following:
      (1)   Acts of God such as earthquakes, wildfires, flooding, and other
emergencies or natural disasters;
      (2)   Delays in obtaining discretionary permits or other government
agency approvals; or
      (3)   Deficiencies in organic waste recycling infrastructure or edible
food recovery capacity and the city is under a corrective action plan with
CalRecycle pursuant to 14 CCR § 18996.2 due to those deficiencies.
   (G)   Persons receiving an administrative citation containing a penalty for
an uncorrected violation may request a hearing to appeal the citation. A
hearing will be held only if it is requested within the time prescribed and
consistent with city’s procedures in §§
37.015 and
37.016, and
37.030 through
37.040 for appeals of administrative citations. Evidence may be presented at
the hearing. The city will appoint a hearing officer who shall conduct the
hearing and issue a final written order.
   (H)   Beginning January 1, 2022 and through December 31, 2023, the city, or
its designee, will conduct inspections, route reviews or waste evaluations, and
compliance reviews, depending upon the type of regulated entity, to determine
compliance, and if the city, or its designee, determines that generator,
responsible party, self-hauler, hauler, Tier One commercial edible food
generator, food recovery organization, food recovery service, or other entity
is not in compliance, it shall provide educational materials to the entity
describing its obligations under this subchapter and a notice that compliance
is required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may be subject to
administrative civil penalties starting on January 1, 2024.
   (I)   Beginning January 1, 2024, if the city determines that a generator,
responsible party, self-hauler, hauler, Tier One or Tier Two commercial edible
food generator, food recovery organization, food recovery service, or other
entity is not in compliance with this subchapter, it shall document the non-
compliance or violation, issue a notice of violation, and take enforcement
action pursuant to this section, as needed.

other ordinance or regulation, has been given notice, by or on behalf of the
City Attorney, enforcement officer, or by any other city officer, employee, or
policing agent authorized to give such notice to abate such nuisance or cease
and desist from continuing such nuisance or violation of law, and such person
who was given notice fails, refuses, or neglects to comply with the notice
within the time specified therein, or if such a time is not specified, then
within a time reasonably sufficient to enable such compliance, such non-
complying person shall be liable to the city for any and all costs and expenses
to the city involved in thereafter abating the nuisance and in obtaining
compliance with or enforcing the law as referred to or encompassed in the
notice.
   (B)   Costs and expenses, as referred to in division (A) above may include,
but are not limited to, any and all direct costs and expenses related to such
things as personnel salaries and benefits, operational overhead, rent,
interest, fees for experts or consultants, research fees, legal costs, or
expenses, including, but not limited to, procedures associated with collecting
moneys due hereunder.
   (C)   In any judicial action, administrative proceeding, or special
proceeding or action of any kind to abate a nuisance, the prevailing party

action or proceeding. Such attorney’s fees shall be recoverable as costs of
abatement.
   (D)   Upon the completion of any abatement pursuant to this subchapter, the
City Manager shall cause a statement of the costs thereof to be prepared for
submission to the City Council. The City Manager shall set a time and place for

consider the statement of costs. Service shall be in the same manner as set
forth in §
90.022 .

the City Council, shall constitute a special assessment against the property to
which it relates, and after its recording, as thus made and confirmed, the same
shall constitute a lien on the property in the amount of such assessment. After
the confirmation of the statement, a copy thereof shall be recorded in the
official records of the county and shall be transmitted to the assessor and tax
collector of the county by the City Clerk. Whereupon it shall be the duty of
the assessor and tax collector to add the amount of such assessment or
assessments to the next regular bills of taxes levied against the respective
lot or parcel of land, and thereafter the amount shall be collected at the same
time and in the same manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected, and
shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure for foreclosure
and sale in the case of delinquency as provided for ordinary real property
taxes.
   (F)   At the time and place set for receiving and considering the statement
of costs, the City Council shall hear and pass upon the statement together with
any objections or protests raised by any of the persons liable to be assessed
for the cost of abating the nuisance. Thereupon, the City Council may make any
such revision, correction, or modification to the statement of costs as it may
deem appropriate, after which the statement as submitted, or as revised,
corrected, or modified, shall be confirmed by resolution. Such hearing may be
continued from time to time. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   (G)   The provisions of this section shall also apply to any responsible
person who received a notice, as specified therein, and thereafter the nuisance
or violation was abated, but such person subsequently allowed or was
responsible for recurrence of the nuisance or violation.
   (H)   In any action or proceeding involving a violation of any provision of
this subchapter, the City Attorney, in his or her sole discretion and as part
of settlement negotiations, may reduce, eliminate, or waive any fines, fees,
penalties, or interest incurred pursuant to this subchapter. Any determination
or decision of the City Attorney in this regard shall be final and conclusive
and shall not be subject to appeal.
   (I)   Moneys due to the city pursuant to this section may be recovered in an
appropriate civil action. Alternatively, such liability may be enforced by
special assessment proceedings against the parcel of land upon which the
nuisance existed, which proceedings may be conducted in a manner substantively
similar to proceedings described in Cal. Government Code §§ 39574 et seq.
relating to weed abatement assessments.

Cal. Government Code § 39502 in order to provide for the removal of all weeds,

the health and welfare of residents of the vicinity and to make the cost of

proceeding to abate the alleged nuisance or to obtain any other appropriate
remedy in addition to, as an alternative to, or in conjunction with the
procedures authorized by this subchapter.

been required to make many return calls to parties, gatherings, or events in
order to abate the violations or, if necessary, disperse uncooperative and
unruly participants. The return calls drain staffing and resources of the
Police Department and can leave other areas of the city without minimal levels
of police protection so as to create a significant hazard to the safety of
citizens and police officers.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates, or requires, a
different meaning.
      EVENT. A noise disturbance that constitutes a threat to the public peace,

months of the party or event taking place;
            2.   The person or persons in charge of the premises where the
party or event takes place;
            3.   The person or persons authorizing the use of the premises for
the party or event; and/or
            4.   The person or persons who organize the party or event.
         (b)   Each of the above shall be jointly and severally liable for the
police services fee except where the person responsible for the event is a
minor, in which case the parents or guardians of that minor shall be jointly
and severally liable for the police services fee.
      POLICE SERVICES FEE. All costs of personnel and equipment for the amount
of time actually spent in responding to or in remaining at a party or event
including, but not limited to, the salaries of the police personnel, the actual
cost of any medical treatment to injured officers, the cost of repairing any
damaged police or city equipment or property, administrative processing fees,
costs associated with recovering the police services fees, costs incurred by a
collection agency, and the overhead and administrative costs related to all of
the foregoing.
      SECOND POLICE RESPONSE. Either:
         (a)   A police response to the location of a party or event made
within 48 hours after the distribution of a written warning to the person(s)
responsible for the party or event (as such term is defined in divisions (b)
through (d) above under the definition of PERSON herein) notifying the person
(s) that the party or event is in violation of the law; or
         (b)   A police response to the location of a party or event made
within 12 months after the mailing or delivery of a written warning to the
person(s) responsible for the party or event (as such term is defined in
division (a) above under the definition of PERSON herein) notifying the person
(s) that the property has been the site of a party or event that was in
violation of the law.
   (C)   Police response at parties, gatherings, or events requiring more than
one response.
      (1)   A police services fee may be imposed when:
         (a)   A police officer at the scene of a party has given written
notice to the person responsible for the party or event that such party or
event violates the law; and
         (b)   A second police response is required to control the threat to
public peace, health, safety, and welfare and to disperse the party or event.
      (2)   The provisions of this subchapter are in addition to the authority
of the police to regulate parties and events and shall supplement, and not
supplant, the exercise of any other available law including, but not limited
to, arrest or citation pursuant to the state’s Penal Code or any other
applicable law, code, or ordinance.
   (D)   Police services fees.
      (1)   The person responsible for the party or event for which a second
and/or subsequent police response is dispatched shall be liable for a police

§ 90.047 GENERAL NOISE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully or negligently make
any noise which disturbs the peace and quiet of any neighborhood or which
causes any discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person of normal
sensitivity in the area.
   (B)   For the purpose of evaluating conformance with the standards of this
subchapter, noise levels shall be measured as follows.
      (1)   Use of meter. Any noise measurement made pursuant to the provisions
of this subchapter shall be made with a sound level meter using the A-weighted
network (scale) at slow meter response. Fast meter response shall be used for
impulsive type sounds. Calibration of the measurement equipment utilizing an
acoustical calibrator shall be performed immediately prior to recording any
noise data.
      (2)   Measuring exterior noise levels. Except as otherwise provided in
this subchapter, exterior noise levels shall be measured at the property line
of the affected noise-sensitive land use listed in this section. Where
practical, the microphone shall be positioned three to five feet above the
ground and away from reflective surfaces.
      (3)   Measuring interior noise levels. Interior noise levels shall be
measured within the affected residential use listed in §
90.049  at points at least four feet from the wall, ceiling, or floor nearest
the noise source, with windows in the normal seasonal configuration. The
reported interior noise level shall be determined by taking the arithmetic
average of the readings taken at the various microphone locations.
      (4)   Commercial areas bordering residential area. The measurement from
the residential area towards the commercial shall be held to the residential
standard.
(Prior Code, § 3120.7) (Ord. 04-07, passed 5-2-2004) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 90.048 EXTERIOR NOISE LIMITS.
   (A)   Maximum permissible sound levels at receiving land use.
      (1)   No person shall permit any source of sound at any location within
the city or allow the creation of any noise on property owned, leased,
occupied, or otherwise controlled by the person, which causes the noise level
to exceed the noise standard for that land use as specified in Table 1 of
division (B) below.
      (2)   If the measurement location is on a boundary between two different
zones, the noise level limit applicable to the lower noise zone plus five dBA
shall apply.
      (3)   If possible, the ambient noise should be measured at the same
location along the property line utilized in this section, with the alleged
offending noise source inoperative. If for any reason the alleged offending
noise source cannot be shut down, the ambient noise may be estimated by
performing a measurement in the same general area of the source but at a
sufficient distance such that the noise from the source is at least ten dBA
below the ambient in order that only the ambient level be measured.
      (4)   If the difference between the ambient plus the noise source and
noise source is five to ten dBA, then the level of the source itself can be
reasonably determined by subtracting a one decibel correction to account for
the contribution of the source.
   (B)   Correction for character of sound. In the event the alleged offensive
noise, as determined by the noise control officer, contains a steady, audible
tone such as whine, screech, or hum, or is a repetitive noise such as hammering
or riveting, or contains music or speech, the standard limits set forth in
Table 1 of this section shall be reduced by five dBA.

   (C)   Correction for character of sound. In the event the alleged offensive
noise, as determined by the noise control officer, contains a steady, audible
tone such as a whine, screech, or hum, or is a repetitive noise such as
hammering or riveting, or contains music or speech conveying informational
content, the standard limits set forth in Table 1 of division (B) above shall
be reduced by five dBA.

         (a)   The Public Works Division is authorized to grant exceptions from
any provision of this subchapter, subject to limitations as to area, noise
levels, time limits, and other terms and conditions as the noise control
officer(s) determines are appropriate, and will not affect the public health,
safety, and welfare from the noise emanating therefrom. In emergency situations
or on weekends, the Chief of Police, or his or her designee, may issue an
emergency exception to be confirmed by the Building Division during normal
working hours.
         (b)   1.   Any person seeking an exception pursuant to this section
for construction-related noise shall file an application with the Community
Development Director, or his or her designee. The application shall contain
information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or activity
for which the exception is sought into compliance with this subchapter would
constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, the community, or on
other persons.
            2. The application shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in
the Master Fee Schedule and amended from time to time. A separate application
shall be filed for each noise source; provided, however, that several mobile
sources under common ownership, or several fixed sources on a single property
may be combined into one application. Any individual that claims to be
adversely affected by allowance of the exception may file a statement with the
Community Development Director, or his or her designee, containing any
information to support said claim. (If at any time the Community Development
Director, or his or her designee, finds that a sufficient controversy exists
regarding an application, a public hearing will be scheduled before the City
Council.)
         (c)   1.   In determining whether to grant or deny the application,
the Community Development Director, or his or her designee, shall consider
denial of the application as a hardship on the applicant against:
               a.   The potential adverse impact on the health, safety, and
welfare of other persons affected;
               b.   The adverse impact on property affected; and
               c.   Any other adverse impacts of granting the exception.
            2.   Applicants for exceptions and persons contesting exceptions
shall be required to submit the information as the Community Development
Director, or his or her designee, may reasonably require.
            3.   In granting or denying an application, the Community
Development Director, or his or her designee, shall keep on file a public copy
of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the exception.
         (d)   1.   Exceptions shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions, including a timeframe on the permitted
activity.
            2.   The exception shall not become effective until all conditions
are agreed to by the applicant. Non-compliance with any condition of the
exception shall terminate the exception.
      (2)   Appeals.
         (a)   Appeals of a decision under this section of the Community
Development Director, or his or her designee, shall be made to the City
Council.
         (b)   Appeals of a decision under this section of the Police
Department’s noise control officer(s) shall be made to the Police Lieutenant,
then to the Chief of Police. Decisions of the Chief of Police may be appealed
to the City Council.

§ 92.09 PUBLIC HEARING.
   (A)   Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or owner of the land received
by the Chief of Police within ten days after the mailing of the notices of
intention to abate and remove, a public hearing shall be held by the City
Planning Commission on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle or
parts thereof as an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle, and
the assessment of the administrative costs and the cost of removal of the
vehicle or parts thereof against the property on which it is located.
   (B)   If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land within such
ten-day period, the statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing
which does not require his or her presence. Notice of the hearing shall be
mailed, by registered mail, at least ten-days before the hearing to the owner
of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such
condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.
If such a request for hearing is not received within said ten days after
mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove, the city shall have the
authority to abate and remove the vehicles or parts thereof as a public
nuisance without holding a public hearing.
(Prior Code, § 3709) (Ord. 91, passed 1-2-1968; Ord. 123, passed 6-7-1971)
§ 92.10 CONDUCT OF HEARING.
   (A)   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the City Planning
Commission which shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent. Said
facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or
parts thereof and the circumstances concerning its location on the said private
property or public property. The City Planning Commission shall not be limited
by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land may appear in person
at the hearing or present a sworn written statement in time for consideration
at the hearing, and deny any responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on
the land, with his or her reasons for such denial.
   (B)   (1)   The City Planning Commission may impose such conditions and take
such other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out
the purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle
or parts thereof if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it.
      (2)   At the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Planning
Commission may find that a vehicle or parts thereof has been abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order
the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as
hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs and the cost of
removal to be charged against the owner of the land.
      (3)   The order requiring removal shall include a description of the
vehicle or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license
number of the vehicle, if available at the site.
   (C)   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he or she has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the City Planning Commission shall not
assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the
property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such
costs from such owner of the land.
   (D)   If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land but does not
appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the City
Planning Commission but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing
of the decision.

§ 92.12 REMOVAL OF VEHICLE.
   Five days after adoption of the order declaring the vehicle or parts thereof
to be a public nuisance, five days from the date of mailing of notice of the
decision if such notice is required by §
92.10, or 15 days after such action of the governing body authorizing removal
following appeal, the vehicle or parts thereof may be disposed of by removal to
a scrapyard or automobile dismantler’s yard. After a vehicle has been removed,
it shall not thereafter be reconstructed or made operable.
(Prior Code, § 3712) (Ord. 92, passed 1-15-1968; Ord. 123, passed 6-7-1971)
§ 92.13 NOTICE TO DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (A)   Within five days after the date of removal of the vehicle or parts

§ 92.14 ASSESSMENTS OF COSTS.
   If the administrative costs and the cost of removal which are charged
against the owner of a parcel of land pursuant to §

disposition of an appeal therefrom, such costs shall be assessed against the
parcel of land pursuant to Cal. Government Code § 38773.5 and shall be
transmitted to the Tax Collector for collection. Said assessment shall have the
same priority as other city taxes.

property or vehicle from any duty of his or hers.
(Prior Code, § 3717) (Ord. 123, passed 6-7-1971)
IMPOUND RELEASE FEE
§ 92.30 PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   It is the intent of this chapter to recover the costs involved
in the lawful impounding of private vehicles pursuant to the specific Cal.
Vehicle Code sections which result from some unlawful act or omission by the
owner or driver.
      (2)   This would be accomplished by establishing a fee to obtain a
vehicle impound release from the Police Department. The vehicle impound release
is evidence that the Police Department has removed its hold on the vehicle.
   (B)   The form will be required to obtain the release of the vehicle from
the towing company. Through the enactment of a vehicle impound release fee, it
is hoped that the persons having their vehicle impounded by the Police
Department as a result of their disobedience of the law will correct the
unlawful conditions causing the impound and eliminate the need for further
enforcement.
   (C)   By doing so, existing police resources can be more effectively and
efficiently deployed toward higher priority safety situations.
(Prior Code, § 3751) (Ord. 94-8, passed 9-6-1994)
§ 92.31 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term defined in this chapter shall have the meaning contained therein
for the purpose of this chapter unless otherwise expressly stated or the
content clearly indicates a different intention.
(Prior Code, § 3752) (Ord. 94-8, passed 9-6-1994)
§ 92.32 RELEASE FEE.
   (A)   There is imposed a fee upon any vehicle’s current registered owner,
the legal owner, or his or her designate, seeking to obtain a vehicle impound
release from the Police Department where such vehicle has been impounded
pursuant to the provisions of the state’s Vehicle Code.
   (B)   Such a vehicle impound release indicates to the towing company in
possession of the impounded vehicle that the Police Department no longer has a
hold on the vehicle and that it is cleared to be released. The vehicle impound
release fee shall be set forth by resolution.
(Prior Code, § 3753) (Ord. 94-8, passed 9-6-1994)
§ 92.33 CRITERIA FOR RELEASE FEE IMPOSITION.
   Vehicles deemed as impounded by the Police Department shall be subject to
the imposition of the vehicle impound release fee at the time such release is
sought by the owner.
(Prior Code, § 3754) (Ord. 94-8, passed 9-6-1994)
§ 92.34 EXCEPTIONS.
   The vehicle impound release fee shall not be applied to impounded vehicles
which meet any of the following criteria:
   (A)   When the vehicle is a recovered stolen vehicle and the vehicle is
being released to the registered owner, or his or her designate (Cal. Vehicle
Code § 22651(c));
   (B)   When the vehicle was taken as evidence, or as the container of
evidence or as a part of a criminal investigation and the owner of the vehicle
was a witness to or a victim of a crime and not the suspect in such
investigation;
   (C)   When the vehicle was impounded in error;
   (D)   When the Chief of Police, or his or her designate, determines after a
post-storage hearing where one has been requested that the facts disclosed at
such hearing warrant a waiver of the fee; and
   (E)   When the vehicle was stored pursuant to an injured or ill driver of an
accident (Cal. Vehicle Code § 22651(g)).
(Prior Code, § 3755) (Ord. 94-8, passed 9-6-1994)
§ 92.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to abandon,
park, store, or leave or permit the abandonment, parking, storing, or leaving
of any licensed or unlicensed vehicle or parts thereof which is in an
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative condition upon any private
property or public property not including highways within the city for a period
in excess of 15 days unless such vehicle or parts thereof is completely
enclosed within a building in a lawful manner where it is not plainly visible
from the street or other public or private property, or unless such vehicle is
stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the
business of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer, or a junkyard.
(Prior Code, § 3715)
   (B)   It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to fail or
refuse to remove an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle, or
parts thereof, or refuse to abate such nuisance when ordered to do so in

such state law is applicable.

(Prior Code, § 3999.14) (Ord. 12-04, passed 8-6-2012)
CAMPING, RECREATION; HOMELESSNESS
§ 93.35 HOMELESSNESS ON CAMPING GROUNDS.
   (A)   As its regional efforts continue, the city must appropriately consider
various interests and formulate policies to best protect public health, safety,
welfare, property, and the environment, with limited resources.
   (B)   The City Council acknowledges the lack of nightly shelter beds and
housing currently available regionally and recognizes the systemic lack of
state and federal investment in shelter and public health services for those
experiencing homelessness.
   (C)   The City Council acknowledges that it is currently unavoidable that
some people will live or shelter for survival outdoors until they are able to
access affordable or free shelter or housing. In the city, this has typically
meant sheltering, sometimes for extended periods of time, on city rights-of-way
and city property, and at times on other agency property such as the State
Department of Parks and Recreation property.
   (D)   Public rights-of-way and public property are generally intended for
public use and travel. The City Council is the authority for rights-of-way
within the city; as such, the city must consider the safety of motorists and
pedestrians traveling on roadways and sidewalks, including to and from
neighboring properties, businesses, and residences. The city has had increasing
concerns regarding safety due to camping on or in rights-of-way and public
property in or near streets, roads, sidewalks, and public access points.
   (E)   Over the long term and working with other governmental agencies and
non-profit organizations, the city’s goal is that people should not have to
live outside and there should be safer options because long-term camping for
survival sheltering outside is not a solution for people without homes.
   (F)   The city owns extremely limited property where camping can or should
be allowed. City utility properties (stormwater, water, sewer) are sensitive
and generally closed to the public or have limited access for safety,
environmental, and security reasons.
   (G)   It is the purpose and intent of the City Council to provide standards
for camping and survival sheltering on city rights-of-way and public property,
which are intended to be as compatible as possible with the needs of everyone
in the city to be healthy, safe, and have access to public places. Smaller
sites support the safety of people who are camping for survival on public
property.
   (H)   It is the purpose and intent of the City Council to provide standards
for camping and survival sheltering on city rights-of-way and public property
which will address issues such as fire risk, unsanitary conditions, trash, and
public safety hazards to people camping and neighboring businesses and
community members, and environmental degradation, which have occurred with
longer-term camping in the city.
   (I)   (1)   It is the intent of the city to evaluate each removal of a
campsite in light of the criteria in §
93.54  and with considerations of public health and safety, including for the
people who are sheltering in the camps, potential user conflicts, and available
resources.
      (2)   The city will use a team approach and coordinate with other
governmental agencies and non-profit organizations as appropriate.
   (J)   When the city removes a camp or closes a location people are
sheltering in the public right-of-way or on public property, it will post
notices a minimum 72-hours prior to the closure so everyone that would be
affected by the move will have adequate notice, except in cases of exceptional
emergency or criminal activity, as allowed by state law and set forth in §§
93.35  through
93.38 , and
93.50 through
93.54.
   (K)   The city looks for the safest options for cleaning the camp, often
hiring a contract company that uses best practices and safe collection and
works with service providers to minimize harm. Unless there is a public health
or safety reason for emergency removal, service providers or other community
resources will be notified in advance to be on hand for support and outreach
ahead of time, consistent with state law.
(Ord. 23-01, passed 3-27-2023)
§ 93.36 USE OF VEHICLES FOR HUMAN HABITATION.
   (A)   It is unlawful for any person to use a vehicle, camp-trailer, camper,
coach, fifth-wheel travel trailer, house car, or recreational vehicle for human
habitation or left parked for storage on any public street, city parking lot,
city right-of-way, or public property, as follows:
      (1)   Between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.;
      (2)   At any time within 200 feet of a residential zoned property
boundary:
         (a)   The 200-foot setback in division (A)(2) above shall not apply to

            1.   This area shall be subject to a 250 feet setback requirement
from residential property boundaries.
            2.   All other areas of the city, not otherwise defined in this
subchapter or §§
93.50  through
93.54 , shall require a 200-foot setback from residential property boundaries;
and
         (b)   At any time, within 200 feet of a school that offers instruction
on those courses of study required by the state’s Education Code or that is
maintained pursuant to standards set by the State Board of Education. SCHOOL
for purposes of this section does not include a vocational or professional
institution of higher education, including a community or junior college,
college, or university. The setback shall be calculated from the school
property boundaries.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, EVIDENCE OF HUMAN HABITATION may
include observations, considering all the circumstances, that a person is using
a vehicle, camp-trailer, camper, coach, fifth-wheel travel trailer, house car,
or recreational vehicle for: sleeping; bathing; preparing or cooking meals; or
possessing or storing items that are not associated with ordinary vehicle use,
such as a sleeping bag, bedroll, blanket, sheet, pillow, used bedding, kitchen
utensils, cookware, cooking equipment, camping gear, food, water, personal
grooming items, or containers of feces or urine. EVIDENCE OF HUMAN HABITATION
also may include observations, considering all the circumstances, that: a
person has obscured some or all of the windows; there is litter, rubbish, or
waste in or around the vehicle, camp-trailer, camper, coach, fifth-wheel travel
trailer, house car, or recreational vehicle; there is furniture set up in or
around the vehicle, camp-trailer, camper, coach, fifth-wheel travel trailer,
house car, or recreational vehicle, such as chairs, tables, umbrellas, or
portable cooking equipment; or there is evidence of human urination or
defecation around the vehicle, camp-trailer, camper, coach, fifth-wheel travel
trailer, house car, or recreational vehicle.
   (B)   This section shall not apply if the street, city parking lot, city
right-of-way or public property is specifically authorized by the City Manager,
or his or her designee, as defined here to be used for habitation.

93.99
§ 93.37 OVERNIGHT CAMPING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code or the City
Development Code, a total of three vehicles per parcel may be used by people
who lack access to permanent or safe shelter and who cannot obtain other

USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY, CITY PROPERTY FOR CAMPING
§ 93.50 PURPOSE, SCOPE.
   (A)   This subchapter is intended to balance and prioritize several
interests: recognition of the essential human dignity of everyone in the city;
the need to have safe and orderly conditions in city rights-of-way and public
property for the safety and benefit of everyone in the city; the right of
everyone in the city to have shelter for sleep and safety; and respect for
public spaces and public property in service to the entire community.
   (B)   With this in mind, this subchapter is intended to regulate the use of
public rights-of-way and city property to protect and preserve public places
for their designed and intended purposes, while also making them available for
shelter and sleeping by people who have no other options for shelter.
   (C)   (1)   The city recognizes that surviving on city streets is typically
an option of last resort.
      (2)   This subchapter and the city’s enforcement efforts will be focused
on mitigating the impacts to public health and safety that can arise from
survival camping in public places.

consistent with any administrative rules and policies promulgated by the City
Manager, or his or her designee, in accordance with §
93.38 .
   (B)   Time.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified, any camping or camp, where allowed, may
only occur for 24-hours at a time in any one location. After a camp has been in
one place for 24-hours or more, the city may post notice at the location that
the camp, and all associated camp materials, must be removed no more than 72
hours later and all personal property remaining will be removed, as described
in §

      (1)   Any area zoned Residential (R-1, CR-1, CPR-1, R-2, CR-2, R-3, and
CR-3) on the City Zoning Map in effect at the time (zone changes amend the City
Zoning Map but may not always be evident on the most recently published version
of the map. The formal zoning designation of an area will control even if not
reflected on the most recently published map. For public rights-of-way adjacent
to properties with different zoning designations, the designation that is more
restrictive for purposes of this subchapter will govern the use of that segment
of the right-of-way).
      (2)   Within any residential Overlay Zone, as determined by the City
Beach Zoning Map and Development Code.
      (3)   Any place where camping, a camp, or camp materials create a

the right-of-way for vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, or other passage;
      (2)   A camp or camping must be limited to a spatial footprint of 12 feet
by 12 feet, or 144 square feet. The intent of this section is to allow a person
to sleep protected from the elements and maintain the essentials for living,
while still allowing others to use public spaces as designed and intended;
      (3)   To prevent larger camping sites from forming and the impacts that
can result, no more than three camps may be set up per street block. If there

§ 93.53 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The City Manager, or his or her designee, is specifically authorized
to modify or suspend enforcement of any section or element of §§
93.35  through
93.38  and
93.50 through
93.54 in the event of a declared emergency, pursuant to administrative rules or
policies, weather conditions (including, but not limited to, extreme heat or
cold), or for any other reason within the City Manager’s authority, regardless
of whether an emergency has been declared.
   (B)   The City Manager, or his or her designee, may adopt administrative
rules or policies governing or guiding enforcement of this subchapter,
including, but not limited to, ensuring consistent and appropriate enforcement
for various circumstances.
   (C)   Enforcement should be tailored for various circumstances, including,
but not limited to, situations where a person has a disability under the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.,
where minor children are present or otherwise involved, where a person has
employment obligations that may relate to their ability to comply with the
code, or for other reasons that may support discretion in enforcement.
   (D)   (1)   Methods of enforcement for violations of this subchapter are not
exclusive and may consist of multiple enforcement mechanisms where legally
authorized and appropriate. However, the intent of the city is to always
resolve violations at the lowest possible level, and to engage to seek
compliance and solve problems while maintaining the dignity of all involved.
      (2)   To that end, violations of this subchapter should only result in
citations or arrest when other means of achieving compliance have been
unsuccessful or are not practicable for the particular situation.
(Ord. 23-01, passed 3-27-2023)
§ 93.54 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   A citation for a violation of §§
93.35 through
93.38 , and
93.50 through
93.54 will be for an infraction. At the city’s discretion, it may issue
administrative citations, as outlined in §§
37.015  and
37.016  and
37.030 through
37.040, and administer the abatement process as outlined in
90.015 through
90.027. Citations will be issued only when other means of achieving compliance
have been unsuccessful or are not practicable for the particular situation.
   (B)   Before a citation is issued, the enforcement personnel will contact
the person and provide a reasonable opportunity to cure or remedy the alleged
violation. In most cases, enforcement personnel will assess whether the person
subject to citation has been referred to service providers and/or local non-
profit assistance organizations and make a referral if it appears none has been
made. The following will be communicated to the person in a manner designed to
help them understand the issue or problem:
      (1)   A description or identification of the activity constituting the
alleged violation and identification of the recipient as being the person
responsible for the violation;
      (2)   A written or verbal statement that the enforcement personnel has
determined the activity to be a violation;
      (3)   A written or verbal statement of the action required to fix the
violation and the time and/or date by which the violation must be fixed; and/or
      (4)   A written or verbal statement advising that if the violation is not
fixed within the time specified, a citation will be issued and that a civil
penalty in the maximum amount provided for the particular infraction or
administrative citation may be imposed.
   (C)   A violation of this subchapter may result in the removal and/or clean-
up of the camp or camps, camp material, or other personal property that are
creating or contributing to the violation(s), typically after a request for
voluntary compliance has been made as described in division (B) above, except
in the case of an exceptional emergency, such as possible site contamination by
hazardous materials or when there is danger to human life or safety or illegal
activities, where removal can be immediate or be accomplished more quickly,
depending on the severity of the situation. Any camp, camp materials, or
personal property in violation of any of the standards in this subchapter may
be removed or cleaned-up by the city or its designated contractors, subject to
the requirements of storage of personal property and notice of storage
described in division (E) below. Camps in violation will generally be
prioritized for removal or clean-up based on factors such as risks and negative
impacts to public health and safety and repeated violations of this subchapter.
A camp may be subject to removal or citation, or both.
   (D)   Upon a determination by enforcement personnel that a camp or camping
is occurring in violation of this subchapter, an established campsite may be
removed pursuant to the following procedures.
      (1)   Prior to removing an established campsite on public rights-of-way
or city property, at least 72 hours in advance, except in the case of
exceptional emergency or criminal activity, the city must post notice at the
location that the campsite must move and all personal property remaining will
be removed and must inform local agencies that deliver services to homeless
individuals where the notice has been posted that such notice has been posted.
      (2)   A campsite may be removed for violation of this subchapter without
posting a 72-hour notice:
         (a)   When there is probable cause for law enforcement officials to
believe that illegal activity, other than camping, is occurring on the campsite
or in the immediate vicinity of the campsite, or the property that comprises
the campsite is being used or is intended to be used to commit or facilitate
the commission of otherwise illegal activity; or in the event of an exceptional
emergency, such as possible site contamination by hazardous materials or when
there is immediate danger to human life or safety; and/or
         (b)   If the danger to human life or safety can be reduced by moving
the established campsite to a safer location, such as an adjacent landscape
strip, the campsite should be moved rather than removed.
      (3)   Once the 72-hour notice has been posted, the city may act on the
notice and remove the campsite beginning 72 hours after posting and for up to
ten days following the posting.
      (4)   After a camp has been removed subject to a 72-hour notice or under
circumstances when no advance notice is required, the camp and all associated
camp facilities must be moved at least one block or 600 feet, whichever is
greater, and the city may order that no camp be set up in that same location or
a 100-foot radius for up to 30 days. The city will post signs informing the
public that camping is prohibited at the location.
      (5)   When removing individuals and property from an established
campsite, personnel will make reasonable efforts to remove individuals without
the use of force, arrest, or citation. No person may be arrested or cited for
failing to move under this subchapter prior to being asked by city personnel to
move.
      (6)   (a)   When removing personal property, the city will make
reasonable efforts to determine if the property belongs to an individual and
has any apparent utility. The city will make reasonable efforts to identify
which established campsite property was removed from to aid in connecting
people with their property.
         (b)   Items that are perishable or that have no apparent use, or that
are in an unsanitary condition due to saturation or contamination from bodily
fluids, whether human or animal, or other contamination, will be considered
garbage, discarded, and need not be stored.
      (7)   Weapons, drug paraphernalia, or other contraband, and items that
appear to be either stolen or evidence of a crime shall be given to law
enforcement officials. Items that appear to have a value of $1,000 or more
shall be stored for storage and safekeeping and shall be made available as
described in division (E) below.
      (8)   Following removal of personal property from city property or right-
of-way, the city must post a notice at or as near as possible to the location
the property was collected and on the city’s website, stating where the
personal property is being stored, and listing the phone number and hours a
person claiming ownership can collect or make arrangements to collect their
personal property.
   (E)   Personal property or camp materials may be removed from city rights-
of-way, city property, or a camp or campsite if in violation of the provisions
of this subchapter.
   (F)   Personal property removed from city rights-of-way or city property and
unclaimed at the time of removal will be stored by the city for a minimum of 90
days, or the duration required by law at the time of the removal.
      (1)   Items that are perishable, that have no apparent use, are not
identifiable as belonging to an individual, or that are in an unsanitary
condition due to saturation or contamination from bodily fluids, whether human
or animal, or other contamination, will be considered garbage, discarded, and
will not be stored. Property discarded, dumped, or otherwise abandoned in the
city rights-of-way or on public property may be immediately discarded.
      (2)   The city will store personal property at or near one of the city
business locations, where people can reasonably retrieve belongings.
      (3)   The city will make reasonable efforts to provide a range of times
the storage location will be available for people to collect their personal
property. The city may dispose of any personal property that remains unclaimed
after 90 days, or such duration as required or allowed by law.

be the final decision of the city.
      (2)   During a period of license revocation, the tobacco retailer must
remove from public view all tobacco products and shall not display any
advertisement relating to tobacco products that promotes the sale or
distribution of such products from the tobacco retailer’s location or that

number of the alarm user, each alarm system zone activated, the time of alarm
dispatch request and evidence of all attempts to verify. The Alarm
Administrator may request copies of such records for any individual alarm user.
If the request is made within 60 days after an alarm dispatch request, the
monitoring company shall furnish the requested records within three business
days after receiving the request. If the records are requested between 60 days
and one year after an alarm dispatch request, the monitoring company shall
furnish the requested records within 30 days after receiving the request; and
      (10)   Each monitoring company shall, upon request, immediately provide
the Police Department with the names and phone numbers of the alarm user’s
emergency contacts at the time of each alarm dispatch request.
   (D)   Conversion of alarm users. An alarm installation company or monitoring
company that converts the servicing of any alarm system account from another
company shall notify the Alarm Administrator of such conversion and shall make
a reasonable effort to provide to the Alarm Administrator, within 60 days from

created by false alarms and teach alarm users how to avoid creating false
alarms.
   (F)   If a false robbery, hold-up, or panic alarm has occurred and the alarm

arrival at the alarm site, the response is not considered a false alarm and no
false alarm fine will be assessed.
   (F)   The alarm installation company shall be assessed a fine in an amount
established by the Master Fee Schedule of the city if the officer responding to
a false alarm determines that an on-site employee of the alarm installation

further alarms may be suspended after the fourth false alarm during the alarm
user’s one-year alarm registration period (excluding duress, robbery, hold-up,

(Prior Code, § 3241) (Ord. 19-07, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 115.12 ALARM REGISTRATION SUSPENSION, FEES, FINES, VIOLATION.
   (A)   The Alarm Administrator shall notify the Police Department of each
alarm user whose alarm registration qualifies for suspension under this
section. The Alarm Administrator may suspend an alarm registration if it is
determined that:
      (1)   There is a false statement of a material fact in the registration
application;
      (2)   The alarm user has had four or more false burglar alarms within the
one-year registration period, except that the Alarm Administrator may waive a
suspension of a registration upon receipt of documented work orders showing
reasonable attempts to repair the alarm system prior to the notice of
suspension; or
      (3)   The alarm user fails or refuses to pay an alarm registration or
alarm registration renewal fee, false alarm fine, late charge, or any other
fee, fine, or charge assessed under this chapter.
   (B)   It is a violation of this section for a person to operate a burglar
alarm system during the period in which the alarm registration is suspended. It
is a violation of this chapter for a monitoring company to make an alarm
dispatch request to a burglar alarm site after the monitoring company’s alarm
response manager (ARM) has been notified by electronic mail by the Alarm
Administrator that the registration for that alarm site has been suspended. A
grace period of five business days after the ARM’s notification shall be
granted for the monitoring company to comply. The alarm monitoring company
shall be assessed a fine in an amount established by the Master Fee Schedule of
the city for requesting a burglar alarm dispatch request on a suspended alarm
site.
   (C)   In addition to the fines set forth in §
115.10(A), a supplemental fine is hereby imposed upon any person operating a
suspended burglar alarm system. The amount of said fines shall be established
by the Master Fee Schedule of the city.
   (D)   It shall be the responsibility of the alarm user to notify their
respective alarm monitoring company of their suspension status. An alarm user
shall be held financially accountable for all false alarm fines incurred.
   (E)   Unless there is a separate indication that there is a crime in
progress, the Police Department may or may not dispatch an officer to an alarm
site for which an alarm registration is suspended.
(Prior Code, § 3242) (Ord. 19-07, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 115.13 APPEALS.
   (A)   If the Alarm Administrator assesses a fee or fine, suspends an alarm
registration or denies the issuance, renewal, or reinstatement of an alarm
registration, the Alarm Administrator shall send notice of the action and a
statement of the right to appeal to the affected applicant, alarm user, alarm
installation company, or alarm monitoring company.
   (B)   The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company, or alarm
monitoring company may appeal any action described in division (A) above to the
Police Chief (or his or her designee) by setting forth in writing the reasons
for the appeal and delivering the appeal to the Police Chief (or his or her
designee) within 20 days after receipt of notice of the action. Failure to
deliver the appeal within that time period is a waiver of the right to appeal.
   (C)   The procedure for an appeal to the Police Chief (or his or her
designee) is as follows.
      (1)   The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company, or
monitoring company may file a written request for appeal by paying an appeal
fee and setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The appeal must be entitled
“appeal from Alarm Administrator’s action.” The appeal fee shall be in an
amount established by the Master Fee Schedule of the city and will be returned
to the appealing party if the appeal is successful.
      (2)   The Police Chief (or his or her designee) shall conduct a hearing
on the appeal within 30 days after the Police Department’s receipt of the
request for appeal and appeal fee and shall consider the evidence submitted by
the appealing party and the Alarm Administrator. The Police Chief (or his or
her designee) must base the decision on the preponderance of evidence presented
at the hearing and must render a decision within 15 days after the date of the
hearing. The decision shall affirm or reverse the decision or action taken by
the Alarm Administrator.
      (3)   Filing of an appeal stays any action by the Alarm Administrator to
suspend an alarm registration or require the payment of a fee or fine until the
appeal process has been exhausted. This provision applies only to the action of
the Alarm Administrator that is the subject of the appeal. This provision does
not operate as a bar to enforcement action on violations of this section that
occur thereafter.
   (D)   The Alarm Administrator or the Police Chief, or his or her respective
designees, may adjust the count of false alarms or assessed fees based on:
      (1)   Evidence that a false alarm was caused by action of a
communications services provider (for example, telephone, cellular, or cable
company);
      (2)   Evidence that a false alarm was caused by a power outage of more
than six hours or severe weather such as a tornado, earthquake, or excessive
winds (35 mph or above as measured by the National Weather Service for the city
area);
      (3)   Evidence that an alarm dispatch request was not a false alarm; or
      (4)   The occurrence of multiple alarms within a 24-hour period, which
may be considered as one false alarm if the alarm user has taken corrective
action, unless the false alarms are directly caused by the alarm user.
   (E)   The Alarm Administrator may waive all or part of a false alarm fine
due to extenuating circumstances or to encourage corrective action with
supervisor approval.
(Prior Code, § 3243) (Ord. 19-07, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 115.14 REINSTATEMENT OF SUSPENDED ALARM REGISTRATION.
   (A)   On the suspension of an alarm registration, a person whose alarm
registration has been suspended may obtain reinstatement of the registration by
the Alarm Administrator if the person:
      (1)   Pays a reinstatement fee as established by the Master Fee Schedule
of the city;
      (2)   Pays, or otherwise resolves, all outstanding fees, fines, and other
charges;
      (3)   Submits a written notice from an alarm installation company stating
that the alarm system has been inspected and repaired (if necessary) by the
alarm installation company; and/or
      (4)   The alarm user successfully completes an alarm user awareness class
and test.
   (B)   The Police Department shall reinstate its response to an alarm site as
soon as is practicable after receiving notice of reinstatement from the Alarm
Administrator. The alarm user and monitoring company shall take notice that the
alarm site has been officially reinstated only after receiving notice from the
Alarm Administrator of that fact. It shall be the responsibility of the alarm
user to verify that his, her, or its registration status and future police
response has been properly restored.
(Prior Code, § 3244) (Ord. 19-07, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 115.15 POLICE DEPARTMENT RESPONSE.
   (A)   Subject to the suspension provisions in §
115.12 and the discretion discussed in §
115.17, the Police Department, at its discretion, will respond to all “in
progress” robbery, panic, or burglar alarms as promptly as possible, taking
into account pending calls for service and any policy establishing priority of
dispatched calls following notification of the receipt of the alarm from the
monitoring company. Police supervisors may, in their discretion, cancel a
police response to any or all alarms based on weather or other factors
affecting police service needs.
   (B)   The Police Chief, or his or her designee, may re-prioritize assignment
of burglar alarms and response time at any time during a 24-hour period as may
be necessary due to the service needs of the community.
(Prior Code, § 3246)
   (C)   (1)   The Police Chief, or his or her designee, may suspend police
response to an alarm dispatch request from an alarm installation company or
monitoring company if it is determined that:
         (a)   There is a violation of this chapter by the alarm installation
company or monitoring company and the condition causing the violation has not
been corrected; and/or
         (b)   The alarm installation company or monitoring company has failed
to pay any fee, fine, or other charge assessed under this section, more than 60
days after the fee, fine, or other charge is due.
      (2)   The Police Department may not respond to any alarm dispatch request
where the alarm installation company or monitoring company who installed or
monitors that alarm has failed to comply with state licensing requirements or
failed to maintain a valid copy of the State Department of Consumer Affairs
alarm company operator’s license.
      (3)   A suspension of police response made pursuant to this division (C)
is subject to the appeal process provided for within this chapter. In addition,
the Alarm Administrator has the ability to accept a workable solution from the
affected party prior to an appeal. The affected party has 60 days after the
written notice of suspension before police response is suspended to its alarm
customers.
      (4)   The Alarm Administrator shall notify all known alarm users
subscribing to an alarm installation company or an alarm monitoring company
that the Police Department has suspended response to the company’s alarm
dispatch requests.
      (5)   The city shall assess the alarm installation company or monitoring
company a reinstatement fee in an amount established by the Master Fee Schedule
of the city. In addition, if the Alarm Administrator has incurred costs in
notifying alarm users by mail of the suspension of their alarm installation
company or monitoring company, reimbursement to the city of those costs shall
be a condition of reinstatement.
(Prior Code, § 3245)
(Ord. 19-07, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 115.16 CONFIDENTIALITY OF ALARM INFORMATION.
   All information contained in documents gathered through alarm registrations,
the submission of customer lists, the alarm appeal process and records relating
to alarm dispatch requests must be held in confidence by all employees of the
Alarm Administrator, city, and any third-party alarm administrator. Such
information is proprietary and is hereby declared confidential and not a public
record. Absent special circumstances, such information must not be released to
the public or any person other than a law enforcement agency, third-party
administrator, or the applicable alarm user, alarm installation company, or
alarm monitoring company except pursuant to court order, per the state Public
Records Act, Cal. Government Code §§ 7920.000 et seq.
(Prior Code, § 3247) (Ord. 19-07, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 115.17 SCOPE OF POLICE DUTY; IMMUNITIES PRESERVED.
   The issuance of alarm registrations does not create a contract between the
Police Department and/or the city and any alarm user, alarm installation
company, or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or obligation, either
expressed or implied, on the Police Department to respond to any alarm. Any and
all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure of the Police
Department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is hereby disclaimed and
full governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an
alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges that the Police Department
response is influenced by the availability of officers, priority of calls,
traffic conditions, weather conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels,
prior response history, and administrative actions.

§ 117.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   In enacting this chapter, the City Council recognizes that commercial
massage therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer the public valuable
health and therapeutic services. The City Council further recognizes that,
unless properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of
massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat
to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose
and intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by
providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy
services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on
under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation,
health, and operational standards for massage businesses.
   (B)   Furthermore, it is the Council’s purpose and intent to rely upon the
uniform statewide regulations applicable to massage practitioners and
establishments that were enacted by the State Legislature in 2008 as Cal.
Business and Professions Code §§ 4600 et seq. by Senate Bill 731, amended in
2011 by Assembly Bill 619, amended in 2014 by Assembly Bill 1147, and amended
in 2016 by Assembly Bill 2194 which also amended Cal. Government Code § 51034,
to restrict the commercial practice of massage in the city to those persons
duly certified to practice by the California Massage Therapy Council, and to
provide for the registration and regulation of massage businesses for health
and safety purposes to the extent allowed by law.

(Prior Code, § 3950) (Ord. 79-5, passed 8-6-1979)
§ 118.02 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall organize or conduct a parade in or upon any public street,
sidewalk, or alley in the city, or knowingly participate in any such parade or
motorcade, unless and until a permit to conduct such parade or motorcade has
been obtained from the Chief of Police or, as hereinafter provided, from the
City Council.
(Prior Code, § 3951) (Ord. 79-5, passed 8-6-1979)
§ 118.03 PARADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE PROHIBITED.
   No permit shall be issued authorizing the conduct of a parade which is
proposed to be held for the primary purpose of advertising any product, goods,

for private profit.
(Prior Code, § 3952) (Ord. 79-5, passed 8-6-1979)
§ 118.04 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   (A)   Any person desiring to conduct a parade shall apply to the Chief of

parade. The Chief of Police may, in his or her discretion, consider any
application for a permit to conduct a parade which is filed 30 days prior to
the date such parade is to be conducted.
   (B)   The application for such permit shall be made in writing on a form
approved by the Chief of Police and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of
$10. In order that adequate arrangements may be made for the proper policing of
the parade, the application shall contain the following information, under
penalty of perjury:

chairperson, and the addresses and telephone numbers of each;
      (2)   The purpose of the parade, the date when it is proposed to be

permit conditioned upon the applicant’s written agreement to comply with the
terms of such permit, unless the Chief of Police finds that:
      (1)   The time, route, and size of the parade will disrupt to an
unreasonable extent the movement of other traffic or will cause an actual
danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which cannot be alleviated by
conditions to be attached to the permit;
      (2)   The parade is of a size or nature that requires the diversion of so
great a number of City Police Officers to properly police the line of movement
and the areas contiguous thereto that allowing the parade would deny reasonable
police protection to the city; and/or
      (3)   Such parade will interfere with another parade for which a permit
has been issued.
   (B)   Standards for denial. The Chief of Police shall deny an application
for a parade permit and notify the applicant of such denial where:
      (1)   The Chief of Police makes any finding contrary to the findings
required to be made for the issuance of a permit;
      (2)   The information contained in the application is found to be false
or nonexistent in any material detail; and/or

STATE VIDEO FRANCHISES
§ 122.01 FRANCHISE FEES.
   A state video franchise holder operating in the city shall pay to the city a
franchise fee that is equal to 5% of the gross revenues of that state video
franchise holder. The term “gross revenue” shall be defined as set forth in
Cal. Public Utilities Code § 5860. Each state video franchise holder shall
remit the franchise fee to the city quarterly, within 45 days after the end of
the quarter for that calendar quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a
summary explaining the basis for the calculation of the franchise fee. If the
state video franchise holder does not pay the franchise fee when due, the state
video franchise holder shall pay a late payment charge at a rate per year equal
to the highest prime lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus 1%. If
the state video franchise holder has overpaid the franchise fee, it may deduct
the overpayment from its next quarterly payment.
(Prior Code, § 10303) (Ord. 14-02, passed 4-7-2014)
§ 122.02 AUDIT AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Not more than once annually, the city may examine and perform an audit
of the business records of a holder of a state video franchise to the extent
reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable statutes and
regulations related to the computation and payment of franchise fees. A state
video franchise holder shall keep all business records reflecting any gross
revenues, even if there is a change in ownership, for at least four years after
those revenues are recognized by the state video franchise holder on its books
and records.
   (B)   If the examination discloses that the state video franchise holder has
underpaid franchise fees by more than 5% during the examination period, the
state video franchise holder shall pay all of the reasonable and actual costs
of the examination in addition to the underpaid franchise fees and interest
imposed under division (A) above.
   (C)   If the examination discloses that the state video franchise holder has
not underpaid franchise fees, the city shall pay all of the reasonable and
actual costs of the examination. In every other instance, each party shall bear
its own costs of the examination.
(Prior Code, § 10303) (Ord. 14-02, passed 4-7-2014)

with respect to state and federal customer service and protection standards.
The city will provide to the state video franchise holder written notice of any
material breaches of applicable customer service and protection standards, and
will allow the state video franchise holder 30 days from receipt of the notice
to remedy the specified material breach. A material breach for the purposes of
assessing penalties shall be deemed to have occurred for each day within the
city, following the expiration of the 30-day time period specified herein, that
any material breach has not been remedied by the video service provider,
irrespective of the number of customers or subscribers affected. Material
breaches not remedied within the 30-day time period will be subject to the
following monetary penalties to be imposed by the city in accordance with state
law.
      (1)    For the first occurrence of a violation, a monetary penalty of
$500 shall be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to
exceed $1,500 for each occurrence of a material breach of applicable customer
service and protection standards.
      (2)   For a second violation of the same nature within 12 months, a
monetary penalty of $1,000 shall be imposed for each day the violation remains
in effect, not to exceed $3,000 for each occurrence of a material breach of
applicable customer service and protection standards.
      (3)   For a third or further violation of the same nature within 12
months, a monetary penalty of $2,500 shall be imposed for each day the
violation remains in effect, not to exceed $7,500 for each occurrence of a
material breach of applicable customer service and protection standards.
   (C)   A state video franchise holder may appeal a monetary penalty assessed
by the city within 60 days. After relevant evidence and testimony is received,
and staff reports are submitted, the City Council will vote to either uphold or
vacate the monetary penalty. Except as otherwise provided in Cal. Public
Utilities Code § 5900, the City Council’s decision on the imposition of a
monetary penalty shall be final.

The PEG signal shall be receivable by all subscribers, whether they receive
digital or analog service, or a combination thereof, without the need for any
equipment other than the equipment necessary to receive the lowest cost tier of
service. The PEG access capacity provided shall be of similar quality and
functionality to that offered by commercial channels on the lowest cost tier of
service unless the signal is provided to the state cable franchise holder at a
lower quality or with less functionality.
      (4)   To the extent feasible, the PEG access channels shall not be
separated numerically from other channels carried on the basic service tier,
and the channel numbers for the PEG access channels shall be the same channel
numbers used by the incumbent cable operator unless prohibited by federal law.
      (5)   After the initial designation of PEG access channel numbers, the

incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their
networks for the purpose of providing PEG access channel programming.
      (2)   Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable, microwave
link, satellite, or other reasonable method of connection. State video
franchise holders and incumbent cable operators shall provide interconnection
of the PEG access channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not
withhold the interconnection.
   (B)   If a state video franchise holder and an incumbent cable operator
cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement, the city may
require the incumbent cable operator to allow the state video franchise holder
to interconnect its network with the incumbent’s network at a technically
feasible point on the state video franchise holder’s network as identified by
the state video franchise holder.
   (C)   (1)   If no technically feasible point for interconnection is

ordinary sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of
the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the

prescribed by the Council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or
delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or otherwise dispose of
the franchise without the consent of the Council shall be null and void. The

   (C)   The grantee shall notify the grantor in writing of any foreclosure or
any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property
of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or
a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be
considered by the grantor as notice that a change in control of ownership of
the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing
the consent of the grantor to such change in control of ownership shall apply.
   (D)   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the grantor in such inquiry. In seeking the grantor’s
consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee shall have the
responsibility of ensuring that the transferee completes an application in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the grantor, which application shall
include the information required under §
122.32(A) through (C). An application shall be submitted to the grantor not
less than 60 days prior to the date of transfer. In addition to the information
included in the application, the grantor also may require from the proposed
transferee such additional information as the grantor may reasonably deem to be
applicable. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the
qualifications and financial and technical capability to operate and maintain
the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the
term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, character, and technical
qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the grantor shall consent to
the transfer of the franchise. The consent of the grantor to such transfer
shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed.
   (E)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets
for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it, or its designee,
satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable
television system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation within 30 days of assuming such control that will ensure
continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the
term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial
institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding
one year unless extended by the grantor in its discretion and during said
period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to transfer the
franchise to another grantee.
   (F)   Upon transfer, the grantee shall reimburse the grantor for the
grantor’s reasonable processing and review expenses in connection with a
transfer of the franchise or of control of the franchise, including, without
limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical
evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and
legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication
costs, and document preparation expenses, not to exceed any maximum that may be
specified in the franchise agreement. Any such reimbursement shall not be
charged against any franchise fee due to the grantor during the term of the
franchise.

§ 122.28 GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE.
   (A)   The grantee shall design, construct, and maintain the cable television
system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the city, subject
to any service area line extension requirements of the franchise agreement.
   (B)   After service has been established by activating trunk and/or
distribution cables for any service area, the grantee shall provide service to
any requesting subscriber within that service area within 30 days from the date
of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure any additional rights-
of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber within such 30-day period

reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a
cable television system or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate,
subject to applicable state and federal law, provided that no such additional
franchise shall be granted on terms materially more favorable or less
burdensome than any other franchise granted hereunder.
(Prior Code, § 10510) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.30 MULTIPLE FRANCHISES.
   (A)   The grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable
state or federal law. The grantor may limit the number of franchises granted,
based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law
and specific local considerations, such as:
      (1)   The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple
cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the utility systems,
such as electrical power, telephone, gas, and sewerage.
       (2)   The benefits that may accrue to cable subscribers as a result of
cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.
      (3)   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Each grantee awarded a franchise to serve the entire city shall offer
service to all residences in the city, in accordance with construction and
service schedules mutually agreed upon between the grantor and the grantee, and
consistent with applicable law.

granted, subject to what conditions. The Council may grant one or more
franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise.
(Prior Code, § 10514) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.34 FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
   Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law. The grantor
and grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time
during the term of the franchise. Upon mutual execution of a franchise renewal

franchise renewal award, not to exceed any maximum specified in the franchise
agreement. Any such reimbursement shall not be charged against any franchise
fee due to the grantor during the term of the franchise.
(Prior Code, § 10515) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.35 MINIMUM CONSUMER PROTECTION, SERVICE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, the grantee
shall maintain a local office or offices to provide the necessary facilities,
equipment, and personnel to comply with the following consumer protection and
service standards under normal conditions of operation:
      (1)   Sufficient toll-free telephone line capacity during normal business
hours, and excepting unusual events such as system outages, to assure that a
minimum of 95% of all calls will be answered before the fourth ring and 90% of
all callers for service will not be required to wait more than 30 seconds,

procedures before being connected to a service representative;
      (2)   Emergency telephone line capacity on a 24-hour basis, including
weekends and holidays;
      (3)   A local business and service office open during normal business
hours and at least some period weekly on evenings and/or weekends, and

requests and complaints;
      (4)   An emergency system maintenance and repair staff capable of
responding to and repairing major system malfunction on a 24 hour per day
basis;
      (5)   An installation staff capable of installing service to any
subscriber within seven working days after receipt of a request in all areas
where trunk and feeder cable have been activated; and
      (6)   At the subscriber’s request, the grantee shall schedule, within a
specified four-hour time period, all appointments with subscribers for
installation of service.
   (B)   The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and
interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.
Scheduled interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and
shall occur during a period of minimum use of the cable system, preferably
between midnight and 6:00 a.m.
   (C)   (1)   The grantee shall maintain a repair force of technicians
normally capable of responding to subscriber requests for service within the
following timeframes:
         (a)   For a system outage: Within two hours, including weekends, of
receiving subscriber calls or requests for service which by number identify a
system outage of sound or picture of one or more channels, affecting at least
10% of the subscribers of the system;
         (b)   For an isolated outage: Within 24 hours, including weekends, of
receiving requests for service identifying an isolated outage of sound or
picture for one or more channels that affects three or more subscribers. On
weekends, an outage affecting fewer than three subscribers shall result in a
service call no later than the following Monday morning; and
         (c)   For inferior signal quality: Within 48 hours, including
weekends, of receiving a request for service identifying a problem concerning
picture or sound quality.
      (2)   The grantee shall be deemed to have responded to a request for
service under the provisions of this section when a technician arrives at the
service location and begins work on the problem. In the case of a subscriber
not being home when the technician arrives, the technician shall leave written
notification of arrival. Three successive subscriber failures to be present at
an appointed time shall excuse the grantee of the duty to respond. The grantee
shall not charge for the repair or replacement of defective equipment provided
by the grantee to subscribers, except when the damage resulted from the
subscriber’s willful or deliberate act.
   (D)   Unless excused, the grantee shall determine the nature of the problem
within 48 hours of beginning work and resolve all cable system related problems
within five business days unless technically infeasible.
   (E)   Upon request, the grantee shall provide appropriate credits to
subscribers whose service has been materially interrupted due to cable system
problems.
   (F)   Upon five days’ notice, the grantee shall establish its compliance, on
an average monthly basis, with any or all of the standards required above. The
grantee shall provide sufficient documentation to permit the grantor to verify
the compliance.
   (G)   A repeated and verifiable pattern of non-compliance with the consumer
protection standards of divisions (A) through (F) above, after the grantee’s
receipt of due notice and an opportunity to cure, may be deemed a material
breach of the franchise agreement.
   (H)   The grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting
upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the grantor.
The written procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may
submit a complaint either orally or in writing specifying the subscriber’s
grounds for dissatisfaction. The grantee shall file a copy of these procedures
with the grantor.
   (I)   Following prior written notice to the grantee, the grantor shall have
the right to review the grantee’s response to subscriber complaints in order to
determine the grantee’s compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to
the subscriber’s right to privacy.
   (J)   It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service
insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. In
the event that the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or
the grantor gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise,
the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive service so
long as the franchise remains in force. In the event of a change of control of
the grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original
grantee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the grantor, the new
grantee, or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers.
During such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any
period during which it operates the system.
   (K)   In the event the grantee fails to operate the system for seven
consecutive days without prior approval or subsequent excuse of the grantor,
the grantor may, at its sole option, operate the system or designate an
operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions
acceptable to the grantor or a permanent operator is selected. If the grantor
should fulfill this obligation for the grantee, then during such period as the
grantor fulfills such obligation, the grantor shall be entitled to collect all
revenues from the system, and the grantee shall indemnify the grantor against
any damages the grantor may suffer as a result of such failure.
   (L)   All officers, agents, or employees of the grantee who, in the normal
course of work require entry onto subscribers’ premises shall carry a photo-
identification card in a form approved by the grantor. The grantee shall
account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle of the grantee
utilized for field maintenance shall be clearly identified.
(Prior Code, § 10516) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.36 ADDITIONAL SERVICE STANDARDS.
   Additional service standards and standards governing consumer protection and
response by the grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in
this subchapter may be established in the franchise agreement, and the grantee
shall comply with such standards in the operations of the cable television
system. A verified and continuing pattern of non-compliance may be deemed a
material breach of the franchise, provided that the grantee shall receive due
process, including written notification, an opportunity to be heard and an
opportunity to cure, prior to any sanction being imposed.
(Prior Code, § 10517) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.37 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   Following the issuance and acceptance of the franchise, the grantee
shall pay to the grantor a franchise fee in the amount set forth in the
franchise agreement.
   (B)   The grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished a statement within
60 days of the close of the calendar year, either audited and certified by an
independent certified public accountant or certified by an officer of the
grantee, reflecting the total amounts of gross receipts and all franchise fee
payments, deductions, and computations for the period covered by the payment.
Upon 30 days’ prior written notice, the grantor shall have the right to conduct
an independent audit of the grantee’s records for the preceding three calendar
years, in accordance with generally-accepted auditing standards, and if such
audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of 2% or more, the grantee shall
assume all reasonable costs of such an audit and the audit may be extended to
include the preceding five-year period.
   (C)   Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by
the grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this subchapter or for the performance of any other
obligation of the grantee.
   (D)   In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not
made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, the grantee
shall pay as additional compensation:
      (1)   An interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate
equal to the prime lending rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the due
date plus 1% during the period for which payment was due; and
      (2)   If the payment is late by 45 days or more, a sum of money equal to
5% of the amount due in order to defray those additional expenses and costs
incurred by the grantor by reason of delinquent payment.
   (E)   Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule
indicated in the franchise agreement.
(Prior Code, § 10518) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.38 SECURITY FUND.
   (A)   The grantor may require the grantee to provide a security fund, in an
amount and form established in the franchise agreement. The amount of the
security fund shall be established based on the extent of the grantee’s
obligations under the terms of the franchise.
   (B)   The security fund shall be available to the grantor as provided in §
122.52(A) to satisfy all claims, liens, and/or taxes due the grantor from the
grantee which arise by reason of construction, operation, or maintenance of the
system, and to satisfy any actual or liquidated damages arising out of a
franchise breach, subject to the procedures and amounts designated in the
franchise agreement.
   (C)   If the security fund is drawn upon by the grantor in accordance with
the procedures established in this subchapter and the franchise agreement, the
grantee shall cause the security fund to be replenished to the original amount
no later than 30 days after each withdrawal by the grantor. Failure to
replenish the security fund shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise.
(Prior Code, § 10519) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.39 DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The grantee shall not construct any cable system facilities until the
grantee has secured the necessary permits from the grantor, or other cognizant
public agencies.
   (B)   In those areas of the city where transmission lines or distribution
facilities of the public utilities providing telephone and electric power
service are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and
maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein underground.
   (C)   In those areas of the city where the grantee’s cables are located on
the aboveground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility
providing telephone or electric power service, and in the event that the
facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are placed underground at
full cost to such public utilities, then the grantee likewise shall
reconstruct, operate, and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities
underground, at the grantee’s cost. Certain of the grantee’s equipment, such as
pedestals, amplifiers, and power supplies, which normally are placed
aboveground, may continue to remain in above-ground enclosures, unless
otherwise provided in the franchise agreement.
   (D)   Any changes in or extensions of any poles, anchors, wires, cables,
conduits, vaults, laterals, or other fixtures and equipment (herein referred to
as “structures”), or the construction of any additional structures in, upon,
along, across, under, or over the streets, alleys, and public ways shall be
made under the direction of the grantor’s City Engineer, or a designee, who
shall, if the proposed change, extension, or construction conforms to the
provisions hereof, issue written permits therefor. The height above public
thoroughfares of all aerial wires shall conform to the requirements of the
State Public Utilities Commission or other regulatory body having jurisdiction
thereof.
      (1)   All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment
erected by the grantee shall be located so as not to interfere with the proper
use of streets, alleys, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum
interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any of the said streets, alleys, or other public ways and places, and
not to interfere with existing public utility installations.
      (2)   In the event that any property or improvement of the grantor in the
public rights-of-way is disturbed or damaged by the grantee or any of its
contractors, agents, or employees in connection with undertaking any and all
work pursuant to the right granted to the grantee pursuant to this subchapter,
the grantee shall promptly, at the grantee’s sole cost and expense, restore as
nearly as practicable to their former condition said property or improvement
which was so disturbed or damaged, and in the event that any such property or
improvement shall at any later time become uneven, unsettled, or otherwise
require restoration, repair, or replacement because of such disturbance or
damage by the grantee, then the grantee, as soon as reasonably possible, shall
promptly, upon receipt of notice from the grantor and at the grantee’s sole
cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition
said property or improvement which was disturbed or damaged. Any such
restoration by the grantee shall be made in accordance with such materials and
specifications as may, from time to time, be then provided for by the grantor’s
ordinance.
      (3)   Prior to commencing any work in the public rights-of-way, the
grantee shall obtain any and all permits lawfully required by such grantor
codes and ordinances of general application for such work. In the event that
emergency work may be required by the grantee, however, the grantee shall
obtain any and all such permits within three working days after the beginning
of such emergency work.
      (4)   There shall be no unreasonable or unnecessary obstruction of the
public rights-of-way by the grantee in connection with any of the work herein
provided for, and the grantee shall maintain such barriers, signs, and warning
signals during any such work performed on or about the public rights-of- way or
adjacent thereto as may be necessary to reasonably avoid injury or damage to
life and property.
      (5)   If at any time during the period of the franchise the grantor shall
lawfully elect to alter or change the grade or location of any street, alley,
or other public rights-of-way, the grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by the
grantor, remove, relay, and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground
conduits, manholes, and other fixtures at it own expense, and in each instance
comply with the requirements of the grantor; provided, that the grantee shall
have no such obligation if other public utilities occupying the same public
rights-of-way are not also required to remove, relay, or relocate their poles,
wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other fixtures at their own
expense.
      (6)   The grantee shall not place poles, conduits, or other fixtures
above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas, electric,
telephone fixtures, water hydrants, or other utility, and all such poles,
conduits, or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed as to
comply with all ordinances of the grantor.
      (7)   The grantee may be required by the grantor to permit joint use of
its utility poles and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys, or other
public rights-of-way, by utilities insofar as such joint use may be reasonably
practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental therefor; provided that, in
the absence of agreement regarding such joint use, the City Council shall
provide for arbitration of the terms and conditions of such joint use and the
compensation to be paid therefrom, which award shall be final.
      (8)   The grantee shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit
issued by the grantor, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to permit the
moving of buildings, the expense of such temporary removal to be paid by the
person requesting the same, and the grantee shall be given not less than 48
hours’ advance notice to arrange for such temporary changes.
      (9)   The grantee shall have the authority, except when in conflict with
existing grantor ordinances, to trim any trees upon and overhanging the
streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public places so as to prevent the branches of
such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the grantee,
except that at the option of the grantor, such trimming may be done by it, or
under its supervision and direction, at the expense of the grantee.
   (E)   In the event of multiple franchisees desiring to serve new residential
developments in which the electric power and telephone utilities are
underground, the following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and
utilization of underground easements.
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire to provide cable
television service to that development. The developer may establish a
reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final development
map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve the
development.
      (2)   If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall
be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a non-discriminatory shared
cost basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall
provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate
to the city any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled
to recover the costs of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event that the
grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee.
      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days’ notice of
the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have
agreed to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators
shall have two working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five
working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until the developer
submits evidence that:
         (a)   It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches
are to be open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed
access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual
homes or home sites, on specified non-discriminatory terms and conditions; and
         (b)   It has received a written notification from each grantee that
the grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on
the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are
mutually agreeable to the developer and the grantee, or has received no reply
from a grantee within ten days after its notification to such grantee, in which
case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its
facilities during the open trench period.
      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not
possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable
television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating
operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities, and
the cable operators, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of
deeper trenches, may be utilized subject to applicable law.
      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated costs.
      (7)   In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the city
reserves the right to limit the number of drop cables per residence, or to
require that the drop cable(s) be utilized only by the cable operator selected
by the resident to provide service.
      (8)   The city reserves the right to grant an encroachment permit to a
cable franchisee applicant to install conduit and/or cable in anticipation of
the granting of a franchise. Such installations shall be at the applicant’s
risk, with no recourse against the city in the event the pending franchise
application is not granted. The city may require an applicant to provide a
separate trench for its conduit and/or cable, at the applicant’s cost. The
construction of such separate trench, if provided, shall be coordinated with,
and subject to, the developer’s overall construction schedule.
(Prior Code, § 10520) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.40 TECHNICAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   The grantee shall construct, install, operate, and maintain its system
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction
standards, governmental requirements, FCC technical standards, and any detailed
standards set forth in its franchise agreement. In addition, the grantee shall
provide to the grantor, upon request, a written report of the results of the
grantee’s periodic proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to the FCC and
franchise standards and guidelines.
   (B)   Repeated and verified failure to maintain specified technical
standards shall constitute a material breach of the franchise.

§ 122.41 HOLD HARMLESS.
   The grantee shall indemnify, defend, and hold the grantor, its officers,
agents, and employees harmless from any liability, claims, damages, costs, or
expenses to the extent provided in the franchise agreement.

§ 122.42 INSURANCE.
   (A)   On or before commencement of franchise operations, the grantee shall
obtain policies of liability, workers’ compensation, and property insurance

      (1)   Be issued to the grantee and name the grantor, its officers,
agents, and employees as additional insureds;
      (2)   Indemnify for all liability for personal and bodily injury, death,

pursuant to this subchapter by providing coverage therefor, including, but not
limited to:

servants, and employees, committed in the conduct of franchise operations; and/
or
         (b)   Use of motor vehicles.
      (3)   Provide a combined single limit for comprehensive general liability
and comprehensive automobile liability insurance in the amount provided for in
the franchise agreement. Such insurance policy shall be subject to review and
approval by the grantor’s legal counsel; and
       (4)   Be noncancellable and nonmodifiable without 30 days’ prior written
notice thereof directed to the grantor.
   (C)   The policy of the Workers’ Compensation Insurance shall comply with
the laws of the state.
   (D)   The policy of property insurance shall provide fire insurance with
extended coverage on the franchise property used by the grantee in the conduct
of franchise operations in an amount adequate to enable the grantee to resume
franchise operations following the occurrence of any risk covered by this
insurance.
   (E)   (1)   The grantee shall file with the grantor, by the deadline
provided in the franchise agreement, a certificate of insurance for each of the
required policies executed by the company issuing the policy or by a broker
authorized to issue such a certificate, certifying that the policy is in force
and providing the following information with respect to said policy:

§ 122.49 ANNUAL REVIEW OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE.
   Each year throughout the term of the franchise, if requested by the City
Council, the grantor and grantee shall meet publicly to review system
performance and quality of service. The various reports required pursuant to
this subchapter, results of technical performance tests, the record of
subscriber complaints and the grantee’s response to complaints, and the

for review. In addition, any subscriber may submit comments or complaints
during the review meetings, either orally or in writing, and these shall be
considered. Within 30 days after the conclusion of a system performance review
meeting, the grantor may issue findings with respect to the cable system’s
franchise compliance and quality of service. If the grantor determines that the
grantee is not in compliance with the requirements of this subchapter or the
grantee’s franchise, the grantor may direct the grantee to correct the areas of
non-compliance within a reasonable period of time. Failure of the grantee,
after due notice, to correct the areas of non-compliance within the period
specified therefor or to commence compliance within such period and diligently
achieve compliance thereafter, shall be considered a material breach of the
franchise, and the grantor may exercise any remedy within the scope of this
subchapter and the franchise agreement considered appropriate.
(Prior Code, § 10530) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.50 SPECIAL REVIEW OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE.
   (A)   When there have been complaints made or where there exists other
evidence which, in the judgment of the grantor, casts reasonable doubt on the
reliability or quality of cable service to the effect that the grantee is not
in compliance with the requirements of this subchapter or its franchise, the
grantor shall have the right to compel the grantee to test, analyze, and report
on the performance of the system in order to determine whether the grantee is
in compliance with the terms of this subchapter and the franchise agreement.
The grantor may not compel the grantee to provide such tests or reports unless
and until the grantor has provided the grantee with at least 30 days’ notice of
its intention to exercise its rights under this section and has provided the
grantee with an opportunity to be heard prior to its exercise of such rights.
   (B)   Such test or tests shall be made and the report shall be delivered to
the grantor no later than 30 days after the grantor notifies the grantee that
it is exercising such right, and shall be made at the grantee’s sole cost. Such
report shall include the following information:
      (1)   The perceived problem areas that initiated the special review;
      (2)   The tests performed;
      (3)   What system components were tested; and

   The grantor may hold special state-of-the-art and services evaluation
sessions at any time during the term of a franchise, provided such sessions are
held no more often than once every four years. The intent of this review shall
be to review the quantity of services offered to the public, compared to the
services available in comparable communities. The grantee shall be notified of
the place, time, and date thereof and the topics to be discussed. Such sessions
may be open to the public and advertised in a newspaper of general circulation
at least 30 days before each session. The sessions may include an evaluation of
any items considered relevant to the stated intent of this evaluation. Either
the grantor or the grantee may propose items for discussion or evaluation. By
agreement between the grantor and the grantee, this evaluation may be combined
with the performance review provided in §
122.49.
(Prior Code, § 10532) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.52 REMEDIES FOR FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Remedies for franchise violations. If the grantee fails to perform in
a timely manner any material obligation required by this subchapter or a
franchise granted hereunder, following notice from the grantor, an opportunity
for the grantee to be heard, and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance in
accordance with the provisions of division (B) below and the franchise, the
grantor, by resolution of the City Council, may, at its option and in its sole
discretion:
      (1)   Cure the violation and recover the actual cost thereof from the
security fund established herein if such violation is not cured within 30 days
after written notice to the grantee of the grantor’s intention to cure and draw
upon the security fund;
      (2)   (a)   Assess against the grantee liquidated damages in an amount
set forth in the franchise agreement for any such violations(s) if such
violation is not cured, or if the grantee has not commenced a cure, on a
schedule acceptable to the grantor, within 30 days after written notice to the
grantee of the grantor’s intention to assess liquidated damages.
         (b)   Such assessment may be withdrawn from the security fund, and
shall not constitute a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it
may have under the franchise or applicable law including, without limitation,
its right to recover from the grantee such additional damages, losses, costs,
and expenses, including actual attorney’s fees, as may have been suffered or
incurred by the grantor by reason of or arising out of such breach of the
franchise; and
      (3)   Exercise its right to revoke the franchise as provided in §
122.53.
(Prior Code, § 10533)
   (B)   Procedure for remedying franchise violations. Prior to imposing any
remedy or other sanction against the grantee specified in this subchapter, the
grantor shall give the grantee notice and opportunity to be heard on the
matter, in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   (a)   The grantor shall first notify the grantee of the violation
in writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand
correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than five days in
the case of the failure of the grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the
grantor under this subchapter or the grantee’s franchise and 30 days in all
other cases.
         (b)   If the grantee fails to correct the violation within the time
prescribed or if the grantee fails to commence correction of the violation
within the time prescribed and diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the
grantor shall then give written notice of not less than 20 days of a public
hearing to be held before the Council. Said notice shall specify the violations
alleged to have occurred.
      (2)   At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and consider all
relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its decision.
      (3)   In the event the Council finds that the grantee has corrected the
violation or has diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice
thereof from the grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such
violation, or that no material violation has occurred, the proceedings shall
terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed.
      (4)   In the event the Council finds that the material violations alleged
in the notice to the grantee exist and that the grantee has not corrected the
same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of
such violation after notice thereof from the grantor and is not diligently
proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the Council may impose one or more
of the remedies provided in this subchapter and the franchise agreement as it,
in its discretion, deems appropriate under the circumstances.
(Prior Code, § 10534)
(Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.53 GRANTOR’S POWER TO REVOKE.
   Subject to limitations imposed by applicable federal or state law, the
grantor reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted pursuant to this
subchapter and rescind all rights and privileges associated with it in the
following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default by the grantee
and a material breach under the franchise grant:
   (A)   If the grantee shall default in the performance of its material
obligations under this subchapter or the franchise agreement and shall continue
such default after receipt of due notice and reasonable opportunity to cure the
default;
   (B)   If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the insurance coverage or security fund as required in the franchise
agreement;
   (C)   If the grantee shall violate any order or ruling of any regulatory
body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to the grantee’s franchise,
unless such order or ruling is being contested by the grantee by appropriate
proceedings conducted in good faith;
   (D)   If the grantee practices any material fraud or deceit upon the
grantor; and
   (E)   Except as provided in §
122.59 herein, if the grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its
debts, or is adjudged a bankrupt. The termination and forfeiture of the
grantee’s franchise shall in no way affect any right of the grantor to pursue
any remedy under the franchise or any provision of law.
(Prior Code, § 10535) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.54 FORCE MAJEURE; GRANTEE’S INABILITY TO PERFORM.
   In the event the grantee’s performance of any of the terms, conditions, or
obligations required by this subchapter or a franchise granted hereunder is
prevented by a cause or event not within the grantee’s control, such inability
to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events
not within the control of the grantee shall include, without limitation, acts
of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, weather conditions,
restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, explosions,
safety incidents involving nuclear facilities, acts of public enemies, and
natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires, but shall
not include financial inability of the grantee to perform or failure of the
grantee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other governmental
agencies, or the right to use the facilities of any public utility where such
failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of the grantee, or the failure
of the grantee to secure supplies, services, or equipment necessary for the
installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of the cable communications
system where the grantee has failed to exercise reasonable diligence to secure
such supplies, services, or equipment.
(Prior Code, § 10536) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.55 ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   In the event that the use of any property of the grantee within the
public rights-of-way is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, the
grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned that franchise property. Any part of
the cable system that is intended for use only when needed because it is
parallel or redundant to other parts the system, or otherwise, shall not be
deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of use.
   (B)   The grantor, upon such terms as the grantor may impose, may give the
grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or
equipment laid, directly constructed, operated, or maintained under the
franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in
this subchapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned aboveground facilities
and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the grantor and shall restore
any affected street to its former state at the time such facilities and
equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its
plant, structures, and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense,
any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and
places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without
materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility
wires, poles, or attachments. The grantor shall have the right to inspect and
approve the condition of the pubic ways, public places, cables, wires,
attachments, and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity,
and insurance provisions of this subchapter and the security fund as provided
herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and
until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
section.
   (C)   Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, the grantee, if
required by the grantor, shall submit to the grantor an instrument,
satisfactory in form to the grantor, transferring to the grantor the ownership
of the franchise property abandoned.
   (D)   At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or
upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as provided herein, in any such case
without renewal, extension, or transfer, the grantor shall have the right to
require the grantee to remove, at its own expense, all aboveground portions of
the cable television system from all streets and public ways within the city
within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than 180 days.
   (E)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this subchapter,
the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as
it does not materially interfere with the use of the street or public rights-
of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public
utility or other cable grantee.
(Prior Code, § 10537) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.56 RESTORATION.
   In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any restoration work
required herein or by any other law or ordinance, and if such work is not
completed within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof from the
grantor or, if more than 30 days are reasonably required therefor, if the
grantee does not commence such work within such 30 days period and diligently
complete the work thereafter (except in cases of emergency constituting a
threat to public health, safety, or welfare), the grantor may cause such work
to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the grantor the costs thereof within
30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs, or the grantor may
recover such costs through the security fund provided by the grantee.
(Prior Code, § 10538) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.57 EXTENDED OPERATION; CONTINUITY OF SERVICES.
   Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, the grantor shall have the
discretion to permit the grantee to continue to operate the cable television
system for an extended period of time. The grantee shall continue to operate
the system for a reasonable period of tine under the terms and conditions of
this subchapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service
and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. It shall be
the right of all subscribers to continue to receive all available services,
provided that financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. The
grantee shall use reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted
service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during transition
periods for a reasonable period of time following franchise expiration or
termination.
(Prior Code, § 10539) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.58 RECEIVERSHIP AND FORECLOSURE.
   (A)   A franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the grantor,
cease and terminate 120 days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or
trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of the grantee,
whether in a receivership, reorganization bankruptcy, or other action or
proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of
this subchapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivership
or trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all defaults under the
franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such defaults which is
satisfactory to the grantor; and
      (2)   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises
whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and
every term, provision, and limitation of the franchise granted.
   (B)   Except as provided in §
122.27(E) herein, in the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the
franchise property, or any material part thereof, the grantor may serve notice
of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in
which event the franchise granted and all rights and privileges of the grantee
hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of such notice,
unless:
      (1)   The grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as
and in the manner that this subchapter provides; and
      (2)   Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.
(Prior Code, § 10540) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.59 RIGHTS RESERVED TO GRANTOR.
   (A)   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the grantor by this
subchapter, the grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is
required to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the franchise.
   (B)   (1)   The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the grantor
determines:
         (a)   That it is in the public interest to do so; and
         (b)   That the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue
hardship on the grantee or the subscribers.
      (2)   To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in
writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of
any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision
subsequent to such instance, nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of
the franchise unless the statement so recites.
(Prior Code, § 10541) (Ord. 98-1, passed 1-20-1998)
§ 122.60 RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
   (A)   The grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, channel users, or general citizens on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex. The grantee shall
comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state, and local laws
and regulations relating to non-discrimination.
   (B)   The grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment
opportunity requirements of federal, state, and local regulations, as now
written or as amended from time to time.
   (C)   Neither the grantee, nor any person, agency, or entity shall, without
the subscriber’s consent, tap, or arrange for the tapping, of any cable, line,
signal input device, or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except
routine maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service, polling
with audience participation, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising
research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be
identified.
   (D)   In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any
collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, the grantee shall take
reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber’s or general citizen’s
right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such
rights are delineated or defined by applicable law. The grantee shall not
without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority utilize
the system’s interactive two-way equipment or capability for unauthorized
personal surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen for any purpose
unrelated to the operation of the cable system.
   (E)   No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment
owned by the grantee shall be installed by the grantee in the subscriber’s
premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any
required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon
the subscriber’s property shall be presumed.
   (F)   The grantee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not sell, or
otherwise make available to any party for any purpose other than the operation
or transfer of the cable system without consent of the subscriber pursuant to
state and federal privacy laws:
      (1)   Any list of the names and addresses of subscribers containing the
names and addresses of subscribers who request in writing to be removed from
such list; and
      (2)   Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual
subscribers. This does not prohibit the grantee from providing composite
ratings of the subscriber viewing to any party.

by (date). If you fail to do so, the City or its agents will enter your property

control of such property shall be encouraged to perform the removal with his or
her own resources.
      (2)   Removal by the city with consent of the property owner. The city or
its agents may remove graffiti upon satisfaction of the following conditions:
         (a)   The consent of the owner of the property is obtained;

and has shown that they are unable to, due to financial or physical reasons;
         (c)   The property owner executes a release and right of entry form
permitting such graffiti removal;
         (d)   The city shall not paint or repair a more extensive area than is
necessary to remove the graffiti, unless the Police Chief determines that a
more extensive area needs repainting or repairing in order to avoid an
aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or unless the
property owner agrees to pay for the cost of repainting or repairing the more
extensive areas; and
         (e)   The owner provides paint of a specific color or match if they so
desire or are able to.
      (3)   Removal by city without consent of the property owner. If the above
solution fails to result in the successful removal of graffiti, the Police
Chief may order abatement of graffiti from real or personal property when the
owner does not remove the graffiti with his or her own resources, or satisfy
the conditions of divisions (A)(1) or (A)(2) above.
(Prior Code, § 3998.09)
   (B)   Standards for graffiti removal. Graffiti shall be removed or
completely covered in a manner that renders it inconspicuous. When graffiti is

the surface, or the surface shall be completely repainted with a new color that
is aesthetically compatible with existing colors and architecture. The removal
shall not leave shadows and shall not follow the pattern of the graffiti such
that the letters or similar shapes remain apparent on the surface after
graffiti markings have been removed. If the area is heavily covered with
graffiti, the entire surface shall be repainted.
(Prior Code, § 3998.11)
(Ord. 09-02, passed 4-6-2009)
§ 131.09 OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY; REMOVAL.
   All persons who own real or personal property upon which graffiti has been

private property in accordance with the procedure set forth in §§
131.07(C) and
131.08(B).
(Prior Code, § 3998.10) (Ord. 09-02, passed 4-6-2009)

costs, shall be paid by the owner or other person in control of the real
property or the owner of personal property upon which graffiti has been abated
within 30 calendar days after service of the invoice.
   (C)   Pursuant to Cal. Government Code § 38773.5, the total cost of
abatement, including all administrative costs, shall constitute a special
assessment against the property subject to the graffiti abatement if not paid
in full within 30 days after service of the invoice. After the assessment is
made, it shall constitute a lien on the property subject to the graffiti
abatement. Such special assessment shall be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject
to the same penalties and the same procedures and sale in case of delinquency
as provided for ordinary municipal taxes.
(Prior Code, § 3998.13) (Ord. 09-02, passed 4-6-2009)
§ 131.11 COST OF ABATEMENT; PERSONAL OBLIGATION.
   Instead of making the cost of abating a nuisance a special assessment
against the property subject to the graffiti abatement, the city may make the
cost the personal obligation of the property owner or other person creating,
causing, committing, or maintaining the nuisance. In such a case, all of the
procedures of this subchapter apply, except those specially related to
assessment of the property. The property owner or person in control will remain
responsible for all abatement costs until reimbursement is collected by the
city from the person creating, causing, or committing the nuisance.
(Prior Code, § 3998.14) (Ord. 09-02, passed 4-6-2009)
§ 131.12 ALTERNATE MEANS OF ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to prevent the City Council from
authorizing the City Attorney to commence any other available civil or criminal
proceedings to abate a public nuisance in addition to or alternative to
proceedings set forth in this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 3998.15) (Ord. 09-02, passed 4-6-2009)

which may include photo or video evidence, to the city’s Police Department
leading to the arrest and conviction, adjudication as a juvenile offender, or
confession of any person for violation of §
131.04 or Cal. Penal Code § 594. In the event of multiple contributors of
information, the reward amount shall be divided by the city in the manner it
shall deem appropriate. For the purposes of this section, diversion of the
offending violator to a community service program, or a plea bargain to a
lesser offense, may constitute a conviction.
   (B)   Moneys collected from penalties shall be deposited into the city’s
fund, and those moneys may be utilized to pay for the monetary reward and
graffiti control program.
   (C)   Claims for rewards under this section shall be filed with the City

violating §
131.04 or Cal. Penal Code § 594;

or the place and the date of the confession; and

representative of the city investigates and verifies the accuracy of the claim
and recommends that it be allowed. The investigation must determine that the
claimant’s information was relevant and directly responsible for the arrest and
conviction of the suspect.

not an emancipated minor, then the custodial parent or guardian of the minor
shall be liable for any rewards paid pursuant to this section.

(Prior Code, § 3996.20) (Ord. 87-8, passed 12-21-1987; Ord. 92-5, passed 7-6-
1992)
§ 151.47 APPLICABILITY.
   The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all mobile home parks
within the city.
(Prior Code, § 3996.30) (Ord. 87-8, passed 12-21-1987)
§ 151.48 LIMITATIONS ON RENT INCREASES.
   (A)   One rental increase per year. An owner shall not impose a rent
increase more often than once in every 12-month period (July 1 through June
30); no such increase shall be retroactive. The owner shall notify all tenants
at least 60 days prior to the effective date of any rent increase.
   (B)   Maximum annual rental increase. Except as provided in division (C)
below, the maximum monthly rental increase for each space in each 12-month
period shall be a percentage increase over the previous year’s monthly rental
equal to 100% of the first 5% increase in the consumer price index over the
preceding 12-month period and 75% of the CPI increase over the preceding 12-
month period for that portion of the increase greater than 5%. Any rent
increase under this division (B) is limited to an increase in the money paid
for rent and shall not include a decrease in services, amenities, utilities,
and the like. For purposes of calculating maximum allowable rent pursuant to
this division (B) for the 1987-1988 12-month period (July 1, 1987 through June
30, 1988), the “previous year’s monthly rental” shall be considered the monthly
rental in effect on July 1, 1987. On the effective date of this subchapter,
there shall be a roll back of the monthly rental rate to that in effect on July
1, 1987, plus the maximum annual rental increase as provided in this division
(B). Should any tenant have been charged in excess of this rollback monthly
rental rate between July 1, 1987, and the effective date of this subchapter,
the landlord shall either refund the excess amounts paid or provide a credit to
the tenant to be applied against future monthly rental.
   (C)   Owner hardship exceptions and tenant rent adjustments.
      (1)   An owner who contends that he or she will be unable to make a just
and reasonable return on the property involved may apply to the city for a
rental increase in addition to the maximum increase permitted by division (B)
above or those increases allowed by § 151.54. Likewise, tenant(s) who contend
that a rent increase has occurred due to a reduction in services, amenities,
and the like, may apply to the city for a rent adjustment.
      (2)   Such applications must be filed by the owner or tenants with the
city in accordance with §
151.49.
(Prior Code, § 3996.40) (Ord. 87-8, passed 12-21-1987; Ord. 92-5, passed 7-6-
1992)
§ 151.49 APPLICATION FOR RENT ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   Fees; contents of request; hearing.
      (1)   Except for automatic increases in base rent allowed under §
151.48(B) and those resulting from vacancies under §
151.50, an owner or tenant(s) may file with the City Clerk an application for a
rent adjustment (“application”). The application shall state the amount of the
adjustment for each space affected and the reasons for the adjustment.
         (a)   An application shall be accompanied by the payment of a fee as
may be established from time to time by the Council.
         (b)   An application filed by an owner shall be accompanied by a
statement that the tenant for each space affected has been served either
personally or by mail with a notice describing the application and the change
in rent or services.
         (c)   An application filed by a tenant shall be accompanied with a
statement stating that the owner has been either personally or by mail served
with the application and with a statement designating not more than three
persons to act as representatives for the spaces affected and containing the
names and addresses of tenants representing no less than 51% of the spaces
affected by the application, and supporting the application and established by
a secret election.
         (d)   A statement shall accompany the application and shall notify the
receiving party that he or she has 30 days to file an objection, and if one is
not filed within the time allowed, then the application will be automatically
granted.
      (2)   An objection to the application may be filed with the City Clerk
within 30 days after the notice of application has been served. The objection
shall identify the portions of the application objected to and shall state the
grounds of the objection.
         (a)   A copy of an objection filed by an owner shall be mailed to each
of the designated tenant representatives.
         (b)   A copy of an objection filed by a tenant shall be mailed to the
owner. The tenant’s objection shall designate not more than three persons to
act as representatives for the objecting tenants. The objection must be
accompanied by a statement containing the names and addresses of tenants
representing no less than 51% of the spaces affected by the owner’s application
and verifying that they object to the application established by secret ballot
election.
      (3)   If no objection is filed to an application within the time allowed,
or if less than 51% of the tenants support an objection to an application, then
the application will be automatically granted.
      (4)   If an objection is filed within the time provided, then the owner
and the tenant representatives shall meet and confer to negotiate in good faith
an agreement regarding the application. Either party may request a mediator of
their choice to assist in the negotiations, but this is not required. If an
agreement is reached within 60 days, then the tenant representatives shall
notify all tenants affected by the agreement. The tenants shall have ten days
to approve or disapprove of the agreement. If tenants representing a majority
of the spaces affected fail to disapprove of the agreement, then the agreement
shall be binding on the owner and all tenants affected. The City Clerk shall be
notified that an agreement has been reached. The statements made in
negotiations and any agreements reached but not approved shall not be
admissible in any subsequent hearings regarding the application.
      (5)   If the owner and the tenant representatives fail to reach an
agreement within the time provided or if a majority of the tenants disapprove
of an agreement reached, then the applicant shall within ten days notify the
City Manager that an agreement has not been reached. The City Manager shall
obtain a list of no less than five qualified hearing officers. Owners and
tenants may each delete one person from the list of qualified hearing officers
within seven days and one of the remaining persons shall be selected by the
City Manager as the hearing officer. Appointment of the hearing officer shall
be completed no later than 21 days after filing of the notice that an agreement
has not been reached.
      (6)   The hearing officer shall set a hearing on the application
complying with the requirements of this division (A) no less than ten days and
no more than 30 days after the appointment. The hearing officer shall notify
the owner and tenants, in writing, of the time, place, and date set for the
hearing. No hearing or any part thereof may be continued beyond 30 days after
the initial hearing date without the applicant’s consent. If the hearing
officer approves an application as requested or as modified, the same shall
take effect as noticed by the owner or as the hearing officer may otherwise
direct.
(Prior Code, § 3996.41)
   (B)   Conduct of hearing.
      (1)   All review hearings conducted by the hearing officer shall be
conducted in accordance with the Ralph M. Brown Act, at Cal. Government Code §§
54950 et seq., and according to the rules of the American Arbitration
Association.
      (2)   All interested parties to a hearing may have assistance from an
attorney or such other person as may be designated by the parties in presenting
evidence or in setting forth by argument their position. All witnesses shall be
sworn in and all testimony shall be under penalty of perjury.
      (3)   In the event that either the owner or the tenant(s) should fail to
appear at the hearing at the specified time and place, the hearing officer may
hear and review the evidence as may be presented and make such decisions as if
all parties had been present.
      (4)   The owner and affected tenants may offer any testimony, documents,
written declarations, or other relevant evidence.
      (5)   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply.
      (6)   Minutes shall be taken at all review hearings.
(Prior Code, § 3996.42)
   (C)   Evaluation; relevant factors.
      (1)   In evaluating the application, the hearing officer may consider,
along with all other factors it considers relevant, changes in costs to the
owner attributable to increases or decreases in master land and/or facilities
lease rent, utility rates, property taxes, insurance, advertising, variable
mortgage interest rates, employee costs, normal repair and maintenance, and
other considerations, including, but not limited to, rehabilitation work,
capital improvements, upgrading and addition of amenities or services, net
operating income, and the level of rent necessary to permit a just and
reasonable return on the owner’s property.
      (2)   In applying the foregoing factors, the hearing officer shall
utilize the maintenance of the net operating income (MNOI) formula. Under the
MNOI allowable gross rents are calculated as follows: all operating expenses
for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1987, are subtracted from all operating
expenses for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the
application for which expense data is available. In the event operating
expenses are not available for the period ending June 30, 1987, then expenses
for a 12-month period reasonably close to June 30, 1987, may be substituted.
The difference shall be added to gross annual rent based on rental rates in
effect on July 1, 1987. The sum shall be the allowable gross annual space rent.
The allowable gross space rent shall be fairly apportioned between all spaces
in the park. The space rent determined under the MNOI formula shall be adjusted
as follows:
         (a)   There shall be an adjustment to allow for inflation calculated
as follows: the net operating income (NOI) for the base period shall be
calculated by subtracting the park’s operating expenses for the 12-month period
ending June 30, 1987, from the park’s annual gross space rent based on the
space rent in effect on July 1, 1987. The CPI index for the month most recently
available prior to filing the application shall be divided by the CPI index for
July 1987. The resulting quotient shall be multiplied by the base period NOI.
This shall be the adjusted NOI. The operating expenses for the 12- month period
immediately preceding the date of the application for which information is
available shall be added to the adjusted NOI. The sum shall be the inflation-
adjusted gross space rent. The allowable space rent shall be the greater of the
space rent calculated using the MNOI formula and the space rent adjusted for
inflation.
         (b)   In calculating the MNOI, there shall be an adjustment to the
gross space rent in effect on July 1, 1987, if the hearing officer determines
that the gross space rent in effect on that date did not allow the owner to
receive a just and reasonable return on his or her property.
         (c)   If the hearing officer concludes that the MNOI formula, and the
adjustments thereto, does not provide a just and reasonable return to the
owner, then the hearing officer may apply any reasonable formula, including a
return on investment, a return on fair market value, or return on equity, to
determine a space rent which will allow the owner to receive a fair and
reasonable return on his or her property.
(Prior Code, § 3996.43)
   (D)   Hearing; determination.
      (1)   The hearing officer shall make a final decision no later than 20
days after the conclusion of the hearing. The hearing officer’s decision shall
be based on the preponderance of the evidence submitted at the hearing. The
decision shall be based on findings. All parties to the hearing shall be
advised by mail of the hearing officer’s decision and findings.
      (2)   Pursuant to his or her findings, the hearing officer may:
         (a)   Permit the requested adjustment to become effective, in whole or
in part;
         (b)   Deny the requested adjustment; or
         (c)   Permit or deny, in whole or in part, requested reductions of, or
charges for, facilities or services.
      (3)   Any decision of the hearing officer shall be final unless, within
15 days after mailing of the decision and findings, the owner, or any affected
tenant appeals the decision.
      (4)   The hearing officer’s fees and charges shall be paid by the
applicant.
(Prior Code, § 3996.44)
   (E)   Hearing; appeal.
      (1)   Any appeal from a decision of the hearing officer shall be filed
with the City Clerk. The appellant shall also mail a copy of the appeal to the
responding party. The appeal shall state the grounds on which it is based. An
appeal filed by a tenant shall be accompanied by a statement containing the
names and addresses of the tenants supporting the appeal. The appeal must be
supported by at least 51% of the tenants affected by the appeal.
      (2)   Upon filing of a valid appeal, the City Manager shall obtain a list
of no less than seven qualified hearing officers. The hearing officer who
previously acted shall not qualify. Owners and tenant representatives may each
delete one person from the list of qualified hearing officers within seven
days, and three of the remaining persons shall be selected by the City Manager
as the appellate panel. Appointment of the appellate panel shall be completed
no later than 21 days after filing the appeal.
      (3)   (a)   At the time set for consideration of the appeal, the
appellate panel shall review and consider the record of the hearing officer’s
hearing as well as the decision and finding of the hearing officer. After
review and consideration, the appellate panel may either:
            1.   Determine that a further hearing shall be held; or
            2.   Ratify and adopt the decision and findings of the hearing
officer.
         (b)   1.   If a further hearing is conducted, the appellate panel may,
upon conclusion of that hearing and in no event more than 30 days thereafter,
modify or reverse the decision of the hearing officer, only if the appellate
panel finds that there has been an abuse of discretion or that there is no
substantial evidence to support the hearing officer’s decision.
            2.   The appellate panel’s decision shall be final and no appeal
may be taken to the Council.
      (4)   If the party filing the appeal is unsuccessful, then that party
shall pay the appellate panel’s fees, charges and costs.

rent increase dates for all spaces in the mobile home park. Such records shall
be available for inspection by the city during business hours.
   (C)   No owner shall bring any action to recover possession of a space
subject to the provisions of this subchapter unless:
      (1)   The tenant has violated an obligation or covenant of her or his
tenancy other than the obligation to surrender possession upon proper notice
and has failed to cure such violation after having received written notice
thereof from the landlord.
      (2)   The tenant is committing, or permitting to exist, a nuisance on, or
is causing substantial damage to, the space, or is creating a substantial
interference with the comfort, safety, or enjoyment of the owner or other
occupants of the mobile home park.
      (3)   The tenant is convicted of using or permitting the space to be used
for any illegal purpose.
      (4)   The tenant has refused the owner reasonable access to the space for
the purpose of making necessary repairs or improvements required by the laws of
the United States, the state, or any subdivision thereof, or for the purpose of
inspection as permitted or required by law.
   (D)   A tenant may refuse to pay any increase in rent which is in violation
of this subchapter and such violation shall be a defense in any action brought
to recover possession of a space or to collect the illegal rent increase.
   (E)   It shall be unlawful for any owner to demand, accept, receive, or
retain any payment of rent in excess of the maximum lawful rent set forth in
this subchapter, or to otherwise violate the provisions of this subchapter. In
addition to any other remedies available, a violation of this subchapter shall
be a defense in any action brought by an owner to recover possession of a
space.
