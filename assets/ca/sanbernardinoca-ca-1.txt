   INDEX
   SECTION 4. Continuation of Existing Law. The recodification and adoption of
the City of San Bernardino Municipal Code is intended by the City Council to be
a continuation of existing provisions of the City of San Bernardino Municipal
Code, and nothing is intended to modify or enact any new laws or new taxes. To
the extent the provisions of the City of San Bernardino Municipal Code are
substantially the same as existing law, the provisions of the City of San
Bernardino Municipal Code shall be considered a continuation of existing law
and not new enactments.
   SECTION 5. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated in the
City of San Bernardino Municipal Code shall be deemed repealed from and after
the effective date of this Ordinance except as they are included and reordained
in whole or in part in the City of San Bernardino Municipal Code; provided,
such repeal shall not affect any offense committed or penalty incurred or any
right established prior to the effective date of this ordinance, nor shall such
repeal affect the provisions of ordinances levying taxes, appropriating money,
annexing or detaching territory, establishing franchises, or granting special
rights to certain persons, authorizing public improvements, authorizing the
issuance of bonds or borrowing of money, authorizing the purchase or sale of
real or personal property, granting or accepting easements, plat or dedication
of land to public use, vacating or setting the boundaries of streets or other
public places; nor shall such repeal affect any other ordinance of a temporary
or special nature or pertaining to subjects not contained in or covered by the
City of San Bernardino Municipal Code.
   SECTION 6. The City of San Bernardino Municipal Code shall be in full force
and effect as provided in this Ordinance, and the City of San Bernardino
Municipal Code shall be presumptive evidence in all courts and places of the
ordinance and all provisions, sections, penalties and regulations therein
contained and of the date of passage, and that the same is properly signed,
attested, recorded, and approved and that any public hearings and notices
thereof as required by law have been given
   SECTION 7. Certification. City Clerk of the City of San Bernardino shall
certify to the adoption of this Ordinance and cause publication to occur in a
newspaper of general circulation and published and circulated in the City in a
manner permitted under section 36933 of the Government Code of the State of
California.
   SECTION 8. CEQA. The City Council finds this Ordinance is not subject to the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in that the activity is covered by
the general rule that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential
for causing a significant effect on the environment. Where it can be seen with
certainty, as in this case, that there is no possibility that the activity in
question may have a significant effect on the environment, the activity is not
subject to CEQA.
   SECTION 9. Severability. If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph,
sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance, or any part thereof, is for any
reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity
of the remaining portion of this Ordinance or any part thereof. The City
Council hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection,
subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the
fact that any one or more section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph,
sentence, clause or phrase be declared unconstitutional. If for any reason any

the City Clerk. In the event there are less than seven Council members present,
or for any other reason, the resolution or ordinance may be continued from time
to time. A motion to readopt the resolution or ordinance shall be considered
and voted upon by the City Council. Five or more affirmative votes shall be

imposed by the contractor’s supplier or to the additional costs of providing
the service during the state of emergency and the price represents no more than
10% above the total of the cost to the contractor, plus the markup customarily
applied by the contractor for such goods or services in the usual course of
business immediately prior to the onset of the state of emergency.

as advertised immediately prior to the proclamation or declaration of
emergency, by more than 10%. However, a greater price increase shall not be

Charter, §
302, the members of the City Council shall conform their conduct to the
following rules.
   (A)   The role of the City Council is legislative in character, which
includes the power to set policy, approve contracts and agreements not within
the authority of the City Manager, or his or her subordinates, and undertake
other obligations consistent with the Charter and code, while deferring to the
discretion of management and staff to choose the appropriate means to achieve
the Council’s goals.
   (B)   The City Council, as the elected body serving all of the residents of
the city, shall perform its duties and exercise its powers in a manner that
serves the best interests of the entire city, rather than any particular
geographic area or special interest.
(Ord. MC-390, passed 7-9-1984; Ord. MC-1438, passed 4-17-2017)

   (E)   The Mayor will work with the City Council and City Manager to
coordinate goal setting and the performance evaluation of the City Manager.
(Ord. MC-1438, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 2.58.050 CONDUCT AT MEETINGS AND RELATING TO CITY BUSINESS.
   (A)   The residents and businesses of the city are entitled to have fair,
ethical and accountable local government which has earned the public’s full
confidence for integrity. The city will operate in an open, honest and
transparent manner.
   (B)   To this end, the Mayor and City Council will adhere to the following
code of conduct to assure public confidence in the integrity of local
government, its effective operations and fair treatment of people.
      (1)   The professional and personal conduct of the Mayor and City Council
must be above reproach and avoid the appearance of impropriety. The Mayor and
members of the City Council shall refrain from abusive conduct, personal or
verbal attacks upon the character or motives of each other, the staff or the
public.
      (2)   The Mayor and members of the City Council shall perform their
duties in accordance with the procedural rules for meetings, established by
them, in governing the deliberation of public policy issues, involvement of the
public and the implementation of policy decisions of the Mayor and City Council
by city staff.
      (3)   The Mayor and City Council shall prepare themselves for public
issues, listen courteously and attentively to all public discussions before the
body; and focus on the business at hand. They shall refrain from interrupting
other speakers, making personal comments not germane to the business of the
body or otherwise interfering with the orderly conduct of meetings.
      (4)   The Mayor and City Council shall base their decisions on the merits
and substance of the matter at hand, rather than on unrelated considerations.
      (5)   The Mayor and City Council shall publicly share substantive
information that is relevant to the matter under their consideration, which
they may have received from sources outside of the public decision-making
process.
      (6)   In order to assure their independence and impartiality on behalf of
the common good, the Mayor and City Council shall not use their official
positions to influence government decisions in which they have a material
financial interest; or where they have an organizational responsibility or
personal relationship which may give the appearance of a conflict of interest.
      (7)   The Mayor and City Council shall not take any special advantage of
services or opportunities for personal gain, by virtue of their public office,
that is not available to the public in general. They shall refrain from
accepting any gifts, favors or promises of future benefits which might
compromise their independence of judgment or action, or give the appearance of
being compromised.
      (8)   The Mayor and City Council shall respect the confidentiality of
information concerning the property, personnel or affairs of the city. They
shall neither disclose confidential information without proper legal
authorization, nor use such information to advance their personal, financial or
other private interest.
      (9)   The Mayor and City Council shall not use public resources that are
not available to the public in general, such as city staff time, equipment,
supplies or facilities for private gain or personal purposes.
      (10)   The Mayor and City Council shall refrain from using their position
to unduly influence the deliberations or outcomes of commission proceedings.
      (11)   The Mayor and City Council will not divert management from the
approved priorities with issues of personal interest or requests for
information that may require significant staff resources without the active
approval of the majority of the Mayor and City Council. The Council will come
to consensus regarding major issues that need further exploration and analysis
so as to judiciously give direction to the City Manager and his or her staff.
This language does not prohibit the Mayor, Council members, City Attorney or
City Clerk from bringing information forward and discussing it with the City
Manager and/or staff.
      (12)   When the Mayor and City Council have not taken a position on an
issue, neither the Mayor nor any Council member should speak on behalf of the
Mayor and City Council. When presenting their individual opinions and
positions, Council members should explicitly state that they do not represent
their body, the city, nor should they encourage the inference that they do.
After a decision is made, the Mayor serves as the spokesperson for the city’s
view on policy matters; the City Council should speak with “one voice.”
      (13)   The Mayor and City Council shall support the maintenance of a
positive and constructive work place environment for city employees and for
residents and businesses dealing with the city. The Mayor and City Council
shall recognize their special role in dealings with city employees and in no
way create the perception of inappropriate direction to staff.
      (14)   With respect to communications with the City Manager and staff,
the following apply.
         (a)   Unless it is a simple inquiry, the Mayor or members of the City
Council will contact the City Manager before going to department heads.
         (b)   When contacting department directors through e-mail, the Mayor
and Council members will copy the City Manager as a courtesy.
         (c)   The City Manager will ensure that the Mayor and City Council are
proactively informed on major policy issues or issues that may attract media or
public attention; likewise, the Mayor and City Council members will give the
City Manager notice if he or she learns of issues of concern.
         (d)   The Mayor, City Council, City Manager and staff will not
blindside each other in public.
         (e)   Council members are encouraged to submit questions on agenda
items to the City Manager as far in advance of the meeting as possible so that
staff can be prepared to respond at the meeting.
         (f)   The Mayor and City Council will refer citizen complaints to
staff and give them adequate time to respond. Staff will report back to the
Council through the City Manager on the resolutions of these complaints.
         (g)   The Mayor and Council members will be provided with information
from staff and other members on an equal basis so that they are equally
prepared to make good decisions.
(Ord. MC-1438, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 2.58.060 PROHIBITING DISRUPTIVE CONDUCT AT MEETINGS.
   The Mayor or any member of the City Council shall not engage in disorderly
or disruptive conduct in the presence of the City Council at public meetings,
which conduct actually disrupts, disturbs or impedes the City Council meeting.
The City Council shall have power to punish the Mayor or any of its members for
disorderly or disruptive conduct in its presence after first providing notice
of the prohibited behavior and an opportunity to be heard. The fine shall not
exceed the sum of $50.
(Ord. MC-1438, passed 4-17-2017)
§ 2.58.070 WILLFUL DISRUPTIONS OF MEETINGS OF THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL.
   (A)   The purpose of the meetings of the Mayor and City Council is to
conduct the people’s business in an efficient and orderly fashion for the
benefit of all the people. That purpose is disrupted by conduct, including oral
statements at meetings, that unduly prolongs the proceedings by being overly
repetitious or exceeding the allotted time, diverts attention from the matter
before the Mayor and City Council by raising or addressing irrelevant matters
or is directed at or to the audience, the Mayor, individual City Council
members or members of city staff individually rather than to the Mayor and City
Council as governing body of the city or the city as a whole.
   (B)   Accordingly, in the event that any meeting of the Mayor and City
Council is willfully disrupted by a person or group of persons so as to
actually impair the orderly conduct of the meeting, the members of the City
Council may proceed pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code, § 54957.9, or any applicable
penal statute or ordinance. For the purposes of this section, WILLFULLY DISRUPT
includes, but is not limited to, continuing to do any of the following after
being warned by the presiding officer to desist from such conduct:
      (1)   Addressing the Mayor and City Council without first being
recognized by the presiding officer;
      (2)   Persisting in addressing a subject or subjects, other than that
before the Mayor and City Council;
      (3)   Repetitiously addressing the same subject;
      (4)   Failing to relinquish the podium when directed to do so by the
presiding officer;
      (5)   From the audience, interrupting, or attempting to interrupt, a
speaker, the Mayor, a City Council member or a staff member, or shouting or
attempting to shout over a speaker, the Mayor, a City Council member or a staff
member;
      (6)   As a speaker, interrupting or attempting to interrupt the Mayor, a
City Council member or a staff member, or shouting over, or attempting to shout
over, the Mayor, a City Council member or a staff member;
      (7)   As a speaker, continuing to speak after being advised that the
allotted time has expired;
      (8)   As a speaker, addressing the audience rather than the Mayor and
City Council;
      (9)   Making personal, impertinent or slanderous remarks to a speaker,
the Mayor, a City Council member, a staff member or the general public, which
actually impairs the orderly conduct of the meeting; and
      (10)   Uttering loud, threatening, personal or abusive language, or
profanity, to a speaker, the Mayor, a City Council member, a staff member or
the general public which actually impairs the orderly conduct of the meeting.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful to violate any provision of this section. Nothing
in this section or any rules of the Council shall be construed to prohibit
public criticism of the policies, procedures, programs or services of the city
or any of the acts or omissions of the Mayor and City Council. Nothing in this
section shall confer any privilege or protection for expression beyond that
otherwise provided by law.
   (D)   If any division, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this section is
for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions of this section. The Mayor and
City Council declare that they would have enacted this section and each
division, sentence, clause, phrase and word thereof, irrespective of the fact
that any one or more divisions, sentences, clauses, phrases or words had been
declared invalid or unconstitutional.

§ 3.27.000 GENERAL FINDINGS.
   The Mayor and City Council find as follows.
   (A)   The provision of new and expanded facilities and infrastructure is
necessary to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of all the
citizens of the city by reducing the adverse effects of urbanization and
development.
   (B)   It is necessary to enact and implement certain development fees to
assure that all development within the city pays its fair share of the costs of
providing necessary public facilities and infrastructure to accommodate such
new development.
   (C)   A proper funding source for the costs associated with new development
is a specific development or facilities fee for each type of facility related
to the specific need created by the development and reasonably related to the
relative cost of providing such necessary public facilities.
   (D)   The Development Impact Fee Calculation and Nexus Report justifies the
imposition of each development fee on new construction by analyzing the Master
Facility Plan, as defined herein, assigning the costs on a fair-share basis to
the various types of development, and assigning the resulting fee per dwelling
unit and/or commercial/industrial square footage, based on the anticipated
burden of such new dwelling unit and/or commercial/industrial area on city
facilities and infrastructure and the need created by such dwelling unit and/or
commercial/industrial area for new and expanded facilities and infrastructure.
   (E)   The primary purpose of the fees is to mitigate the impact on city
facilities and infrastructure caused by increased demand for facilities and
infrastructure from persons generated by new development.
   (F)   The fees will be used to finance public facilities and infrastructure,
specifically local circulation system improvements (streets, traffic signals
and bridges); regional circulation system improvements; law enforcement and
fire protection facilities, vehicles and equipment; library facilities and
collection; public meeting facilities; aquatics facilities; and parkland and
open space acquisition and development.
   (G)   The use of the fees to fund such public facilities and infrastructure
is reasonably related to the impacts of residential development and other
development on the city as more fully described in the Development Impact Fee
Calculation and Nexus Report.
   (H)   The need for development fees to fund such public facilities is
reasonably related to impacts on the city of residential development and other
development as more fully described in the Development Impact Fee Calculation
and Nexus Report.
   (I)   To assure fair and legally sound implementation of the development
fees established in this chapter, such fees shall be reviewed annually and the
amounts of such fees shall be adopted by resolution of the Mayor and City
Council at a public hearing.
   (J)   To assure fair implementation of the development fees established in
this chapter, the city must have the latitude to phase the imposition of
certain fees.
   (K)   To assure fair implementation of the development fees established in
this chapter, the city must have the latitude to defer such fees in special
cases, after notice and hearing, where better or more fair financing
arrangements would result from such deferral.
   (L)   To assure fair implementation of the development fees established by
this chapter, provisions must be made for extending such fees to subsequently
annexed land that benefits from the public facilities funded by these fees.
§ 3.27.010 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The Mayor and City Council declare the purpose of this chapter is to
provide for the means to finance adequate infrastructure and other public
improvements and facilities made necessary by the impacts created by new
development in the city in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the city. This chapter shall apply solely to construction of
new dwelling units or new commercial or industrial square footage within the
city.
   (B)   The following are specifically exempt from the provisions of this
chapter:
      (1)   Additions or improvements to dwelling units after construction is
complete, unless such additions or improvements:
         (a)   Increase the number of dwelling units on the property, as
defined herein; and
         (b)   Are not secondary residential units, as defined herein.
      (2)   Government/public buildings, public schools or other public
facilities;
      (3)   The rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of any legal, residential
structure and/or the replacement of a previously existing dwelling unit;
      (4)   The rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of any commercial or
industrial structure where there is no net increase in square footage of the
structure. Any increase in square footage of the structure shall pay the
current applicable development impact fees for such increase; and
      (5)   Development projects that are the subject of a development
agreement entered into pursuant to Cal. Gov’t. Code, §§ 65864 et seq., prior to
the initial effective date of this chapter, wherein the imposition of new fees
is expressly prohibited; provided, however, that if the term of such
development agreement is extended after the initial effective date of this
chapter, the development impact fees shall be imposed.

(Ord. MC-1238, passed 1-23-2007)
§ 3.27.030 LAW ENFORCEMENT FACILITIES, VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT IMPACT FEE -
FINDINGS.
   The Mayor and City Council find as follows.
   (A)   The development of residential, commercial and industrial property in
the affected territory will create a need for increased police protection
services. As a result, additional officers will be needed to maintain the
current level of service. The new officers will require, among other things,
expanded station facilities and additional patrol or unmarked vehicles and
additional police equipment.
   (B)   Pursuant to Article XI, § 7 of the California Constitution, the city
is empowered to enact measures that protect the health, safety and welfare of
its citizens.
   (C)   The provision of expanded station facilities and vehicles is
identified in the “Law Enforcement Facilities” section of the Master Facility
Plan and is necessary to provide adequate law enforcement services.
   (D)   The development impact fee report describes in detail the number of
calls for service that each major category of land use generates on average;
the law enforcement facilities, vehicles and equipment required to service new
development; and estimates of the costs for capital to provide those services.
   (E)   The entire affected territory will derive benefit from the station
facilities and vehicles and should be assessed per the provisions of this
chapter and pay a fair share of the cost thereof based on the benefit derived
therefrom.
   (F)   After consideration of the development impact fee report and testimony
at this public hearing, the Mayor and City Council approve the development
impact fee report and the addendum, and based thereon finds that new
development in the affected territory will create law enforcement needs that
the construction and acquisition of the public improvements funded by this
chapter will meet.
   (G)   The Mayor and City Council also find that the costs of the law
enforcement facilities funded by this chapter are apportioned relative to the
anticipated impacts created by development within the affected territory, and
that the fees are fairly apportioned on individual dwelling units and per
square foot throughout the affected territory on the basis of benefits
conferred on property proposed for development and the need for such facilities
created by the proposed development.
   (H)   The facts and evidence establish that there is a reasonable
relationship between the need for the described public facilities and the needs
created by the types of development on which the fee will be imposed, and that
there is a reasonable relationship between the fee’s use and the types of
development for which the fee is charged. This reasonable relationship is
described in more detail in the development impact fee report and the addendum
thereto.
   (I)   The Mayor and City Council also find that the cost estimates set forth
in the development impact fee report are reasonable and will not exceed the
reasonably estimated total of these costs.
   (J)   The law enforcement facilities fees collected pursuant to this chapter
shall be used only to finance the law enforcement facilities described or
identified in the “Law Enforcement Facilities” section of the Master Facility
Plan.
   (K)   The law enforcement facilities fee is imposed on new residential,
commercial and industrial development and the amount of such fee shall be set
by resolution of the Mayor and City Council.
§ 3.27.040 FIRE SUPPRESSION FACILITIES, VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT IMPACT FEE -
FINDINGS.
   The Mayor and City Council find as follows.
   (A)   The development of residential, commercial and industrial property in
the city will create increased calls for fire protection services. As a result,
new equipment and expansion of existing facilities to house additional
firefighters and equipment will be needed to maintain current levels of
service.
   (B)   Pursuant to Article XI, § 7 of the California Constitution, the city
is empowered to enact measures that protect the health, safety and welfare of
its citizens.
   (C)   The acquisition of new equipment and relocation, expansion and
construction of fire protection facilities are identified in the “Fire
Protection Facilities” section of the Master Facility Plan and are necessary to
provide adequate fire protection services within the city.
   (D)   The development impact fee report and the addendum thereto describe in
detail the number of calls for service that each major category of land use
generates, the fire protection facilities required to service new development
and estimates of the costs of those facilities.
   (E)   The entire affected territory will derive benefit from the new
equipment and relocated, expanded and newly-constructed fire station facilities
and should be assessed per the provisions of this chapter and pay a fair share
of the cost thereof based on the benefit derived therefrom.
   (F)   After consideration of the development impact fee report and the
addendum thereto and testimony at this public hearing, the Mayor and City
Council approve the development impact fee report and the addendum thereto, and
based thereon finds that new development in the city will create fire

Statutory reference:
   Quimby Act, see Cal. Gov’t Code, § 66477
§ 3.27.140 DEVELOPMENT FEE CREDITS; PREPAYMENT.
   (A)   The owner of a parcel of property otherwise required to pay a fee
under this chapter shall receive a credit for the corresponding development fee
when that owner constructs or donates a facility, or a portion thereof,
identified in the Master Facility Plan, regardless of how it may be financed,
that serves the owner’s parcel or parcels. The development fee credit shall
offset, on a proportionate basis without interest, the corresponding
development fee to be paid pursuant to this chapter. The facility must be built
in compliance with all applicable laws governing the construction of public
improvements.
   (B)   The amount of the development fee credit shall equal the city’s most
recent estimated cost of constructing and/or furnishing the facility, or the
portion of the facility actually completed or purchased, by contract or
utilizing city forces.
   (C)   The owner of a parcel of property may be further entitled to a
development fee credit where the city determines, on a case-by-case basis, that
the construction of the facility, or a portion thereof, will be necessary to
provide basic services to the entire city even though it does not directly
serve the owner’s project or is of greater capacity than that required to serve
the owner’s project adequately.
   (D)   The amount of the development fee credit shall be determined after
inspection and acceptance of the facility at the time of payment of the
corresponding facilities fee.
   (E)   If an owner pays the facilities fee assessed under this chapter and
later elects, after city approval, to accelerate the development by
constructing or purchasing facilities for the project, the owner may apply for
and receive a refund, up to the amount of the facilities fee, for such
facilities after those facilities are certified by the City Engineer as
complying with the appropriate Master Facility Plan, city ordinances and
applicable law.
   (F)   To the extent that an owner is granted a development fee credit, such
owner shall not be entitled to a future reimbursement for such facility except
as provided in §
3.27.150.
   (G)   A development fee credit is an obligation of the city that runs with
the land and inures to the benefit of each successor in interest of the
original landowner until full credit has been received.
   (H)   A developer shall also be entitled to a credit if the city and
developer have executed an agreement or there is a preexisting ordinance which
specifically exempts the developer from the payment of one or more of the fees
enacted under this chapter. The availability of the credit and its amount shall
be determined by the city on a case-by-case basis based on the provisions of
the applicable agreement.
   (I)   A developer or any public agency may prepay all or any portion of one
or more fees under this chapter through the use of funds, revenues or grants
that are derived from sources other than those of the city or revenues
generated from the fees collected under this chapter. The Mayor and City
Council are authorized to enter agreements with developers or public agencies
to accept any prepayments of one or more of the fees under this chapter based
upon findings and determinations to be made by the Mayor and City Council to
acknowledge said prepayment and to approve any agreement with any developer or
public agency to evidence such prepayment.
§ 3.27.150 REIMBURSEMENT.
   (A)   The owner of a parcel of property otherwise required to pay a
facilities fee under this chapter will be entitled to enter into a
reimbursement agreement to reimburse from subsequently collected development
fees the direct and verifiable costs of installing or furnishing public
improvements, or portions thereof, identified in the appropriate Master
Facility Plan where all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner has constructed a public improvement, or portion thereof,
that is identified in the appropriate Master Facility Plan;
      (2)   The city required that the public improvement be constructed to
contain supplemental size, capacity, number or length for the benefit of
property not within the owner’s project;
      (3)   The city approved, prior to construction or furnishing, the
proposed budget for the project and finds any change to that budget fair and
reasonable;
      (4)   The public improvement, or portion thereof, has been dedicated to
the public; and
      (5)   The public improvement, or portion thereof, has been built in
compliance with all applicable laws governing the construction of public works.
   (B)   The city shall not reimburse the owner for costs related to financing
any public facility.
   (C)   An owner shall only be entitled to reimbursement to the extent that
any public facility project benefits property not within the owner’s project.
Thus, an owner may receive a development fee credit, as provided in §
3.27.140, for the portion of a public facility that serves the owner’s project
and reimbursement for the oversized or extra-capacity or extended portion of a
public facility that benefits subsequently developed property.
   (D)   In no event shall an owner receive a development fee credit and/or
reimbursement in excess of the city’s most recent estimated cost of
constructing the facility, or the portion of the facility actually completed,
by contract or by utilizing city forces.
   (E)   Any reimbursement agreement entered into under this section shall
require the city, for a period of up to 15 years, to reimburse the owner from
the proceeds of the facilities fees collected from new projects that directly
benefit from the facilities financed by the facilities fee or fees and which
are the subject of the reimbursement agreement. Reimbursement shall only be
made from fees collected to fund improvements which are of the same type as the
improvement constructed by the owner, and from no other source. The terms of
the reimbursement shall be set forth in the reimbursement agreement.
§ 3.27.170 DEFERRALS.
   (A)   The Mayor and City Council are empowered to grant deferral of any fee
imposed by this chapter upon the recommendation of the Director of Development
Services, except the regional circulation systems fee established in §
3.27.060. Such deferral may only be granted after notice and hearing if, in the
opinion of the Mayor and City Council, properly supported by specific findings,
deferral would allow a better or fairer financing arrangement to be developed
and imposed. Findings must be based on written and other evidence submitted by
the property owner, substantiating the owner’s contention that the fee should
be deferred.
   (B)   Findings must include facts supporting deferral, including, without
limitation, findings that in the case of deferral:
      (1)   Other properties to be benefitted by any fee will not be burdened
by the review and delay in fee imposition;
      (2)   Alternative financing methods involving more than one owner have
been proposed for review; or
      (3)   Delay will result in a more fair funding arrangement.
§ 3.27.180 APPLICATION TO SUBSEQUENTLY ANNEXED LAND.
   As areas not presently situated within the city boundaries seek to annex to
the city, the Mayor and City Council shall determine the benefit to such land
areas of the public facilities and infrastructure funded by this chapter. The
Mayor and City Council shall impose development fees, in whole or in part, as
established by this chapter, upon such annexed areas to the extent necessary to
assure that such areas pay their fair share of the actual costs of all
necessary public facilities and infrastructure benefitting their projects,
unless the Mayor and City Council determines that such an imposition would
cause inequities or that a better or fairer financing arrangement can and
should be developed and imposed.

which the receipt refers.
   (B)   Each service provider shall bill for utility users taxes accrued at
the rate established in this code, coincident with the provider’s own bill for
service provided, all persons, except those specifically exempted from such
tax. Any tax collected by the provider from the service user, together with any
amount uncollected due to the failure or neglect of the service provider to
bill for or attempt to collect the tax, shall constitute a debt owed by the
service provider to the city. If the service user fails or refuses to pay any
such tax, the provider shall not be liable for any billed but uncollected tax.
Each service provider shall provide to the City Director of Finance and
Management Services, at least annually, a list of the names, addresses and
amount of tax billed but unpaid, together with such data as may be required by
the Director of Finance and Management Services to enable him or her to pursue
the matter through court or otherwise. Any amount collected as tax from a

to collect and remit the tax, unless such amount has been refunded or credited
to the service user.

chapter shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the city for the
recovery of the debt, together with costs, interest and penalties.

   (A)   The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as
and along with the charges made in accordance with the regular billing
practice. If the amount paid by a service user is less than the full amount of
the charge and tax which has accrued for the billing period, a proportionate
share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid.
   (B)   The duty to collect tax from a service user shall commence with the
beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to that person which
starts on or after the operative date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter. Where a person receives more than one billing, one or more being for
different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for
each billing period.

§ 3.44.110 ASSESSMENT - ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY.
   (A)   The Director of Finance and Management Services may make an assessment
for taxes not paid or remitted by a person required to pay or remit. The
Director of Finance and Management Services shall prepare a notice of the
assessment which shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes and penalties
imposed and the time and place when such assessment shall be submitted to the
Mayor and City Council for confirmation or modification. The City Clerk shall
mail a copy of such notice to the person selling the service and to the service
user at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing and shall post such
notice for at least five continuous days prior to the date of the hearing on
the chamber door of the Mayor and City Council. Any interested party having any
objections may appear and be heard at the hearing; provided his or her
objection is filed in writing with the City Clerk prior to the time set for the
hearing. At the time fixed for considering the assessment, the Mayor and City
Council shall hear the same, together with any objection filed as aforesaid and
thereupon may confirm or modify the assessment by motion.
   (B)   Whenever the Director of Finance and Management Services determines
that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by him
or her from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or
that a service user has failed to pay the amount of the tax to such person for
a period of two or more billing periods, or whenever the Director of Finance
and Management Services deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she
may relieve such person of the obligation to collect taxes due under this
chapter from certain named service users for specified billing periods. The
Director of Finance and Management Services shall notify the service user that
he or she has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated
periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the
service user by handing it to him or her personally or by deposit of the notice
in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service
user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect
the tax; or, should the service user have changed his or her address, to his or
her last known address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the
Director of Finance and Management Services within 15 days from the date of the
service of the notice upon him or her, which shall be the date of mailing if
service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of 25% of the amount of the
tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed but not less than $5. The penalty
shall become part of the tax herein required to be paid.

§ 3.44.120 RECORDS.
   It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and remit to the
city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of
three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such
tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to
the Director of Finance and Management Services, which records the Director of
Finance and Management Services shall have the right to inspect at all
reasonable times.

§ 3.44.130 OVERPAYMENT, EXTRA PAYMENT - REFUNDS.
   (A)   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than
once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Director
of Finance and Management Services under this chapter, it may be refunded as
provided in this section.
   (B)   A person required to collect and remit taxes imposed under this
chapter may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and
remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally
collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the
Director of Finance and Management Services that the service user from whom the
tax has been collected did not owe the tax; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the service user or credited to charges
subsequently payable by the service user to the person required to collect and
remit.
   (C)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant has submitted a written claim to the Director of Finance and
Management Services within one year of the overpayment of erroneous or illegal
collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant’s right to
the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. The submission of a
written claim, which is acted upon by the City Council, shall be a prerequisite
to a suit thereon. (See Cal. Gov’t Code, § 935.) The Mayor and City Council
shall act upon the refund claim within the time period set forth in Cal. Gov’t
Code, § 912.4; the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected on the last day
of the period within which the Mayor and City Council was required to act upon
the claim as provided in Cal. Gov’t Code, § 912.4. It is the intent of the
Mayor and City Council that the requirement of this division (C) to file a
written claim within one year of the overpayment of erroneous or illegal
collection of said tax be given retroactive effect to all claims that arose
under this Chapter 3.44 at any time period to the effective date of the
ordinance incorporated in this chapter; provided, however, that any claims
which arose prior to the commencement of the one-year claims period of this
division (C), and which are not otherwise barred by a then applicable statute
of limitations or claims procedure, must be filed with the Director of Finance
and Management Services as provided in this division (C) within 90 days
following the effective date of the ordinance incorporated in this chapter.

§ 3.44.131 UTILITY USERS TAX REBATE PROGRAM.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in order to
attract new businesses that provide significant numbers of higher-wage jobs,
the following utility users tax rebate program is established.
      (1)   Any new business that creates, after January 1, 2000, between five
to 49 new, permanent, full-time jobs within the city (50% of such new jobs
shall pay at least $25,000 per year in wages and/or commissions, except that
the dollar requirement for said jobs shall not apply to manufacturing and
distribution businesses) shall be eligible for a rebate on the amount of
utility users tax, paid by such business on electrical, gas, video and
telephone communication services, imposed by this chapter according to the
following schedule:
         (a)   First year: 75% rebate;
         (b)   Second year: 50% rebate;
         (c)   Third year: 25% rebate; and
         (d)   Fourth and subsequent years: no rebate.
      (2)   Any new business that creates, after January 1, 2000, 50 or more
new, permanent, full-time jobs within the city (50% of such new jobs shall pay
at least $25,000 per year in wages and/or commissions, except that the dollar
requirement for said jobs shall not apply to manufacturing and distribution
businesses) shall be eligible for a rebate on the amount of utility users tax,
paid by such business on electrical, gas, video and telephone communication
services, imposed by this chapter according to the following schedule:
         (a)   First year: 80% rebate;
         (b)   Second year: 60% rebate;
         (c)   Third year: 40% rebate; and
         (d)   Fourth and subsequent years: no rebate.
      (3)   Any new business not included under divisions (A)(1) or (A)(2)
above, which provides, after January 1, 2000, at least a 25% increase in
assessed valuation of the business’ real property over the previous tax year as
shown by the County Tax Assessor’s records, or which generates at least $40,000
in sales tax revenues per year remitted to the city, shall be eligible for a
rebate on the amount of utility users tax, paid by such business on electrical,
gas, video and telephone communication services, imposed by this chapter
according to the following schedule:
         (a)   First year: 75% rebate;
         (b)   Second year: 50% rebate;
         (c)   Third year: 25% rebate; and
         (d)   Fourth and subsequent years: no rebate.
      (4)   A new business qualified under divisions (A)(1) or (A)(2) above
shall also be eligible for an additional rebate of 1% on the amount of utility
users tax paid, for each city resident that is hired to fill the new,
permanent, full-time jobs created within the city. Eligibility for any such
additional rebates shall be established by determining the residency of the new
employees at the end of each year of rebate eligibility. This determination
shall be verified by the Economic Development Agency with such supporting
documentation as may be required by the Economic Development Agency. In no case
shall the total rebate paid to any claimant exceed the total amount of utility
users tax paid on the period claimed, nor rebates be paid for any term other
than the schedule established in divisions (A)(1) or (A)(2) above.
      (5)   To claim a rebate under this section, the claimant shall submit a
completed verified claim form to the Economic Development Agency with such
supporting documentation as may be required by the Economic Development Agency
to determine claimant’s eligibility and to establish the amount of utility
users tax paid by claimant on the period claimed, and the commencement date of
the “first year,” as that term is used herein. A claim for a rebate shall be
submitted annually to the Economic Development Agency not later than three
months after the close of the year for which such refund is sought. The
verified claim must be signed by an authorized officer of the claimant. The
rebate shall be paid at the recommendation of the Economic Development Agency
and subject to approval of the Department of Finance and Management Services.
      (6)   No rebates shall be paid if the subject business is no longer in
operation in the city.
      (7)   FIRST YEAR, as used in this section, shall mean, for a new
business, the 12-month period immediately following the date of commencement of
business at the location for which a claim for rebate is filed.
   (B)   Not withstanding any other provision of this chapter, in order to
encourage the physical expansion and/or creation of significant numbers of
higher-wage jobs by existing city businesses, the following utility users tax
rebate program is established to complement the program recently adopted for
new businesses.
      (1)   Any business currently operating in the city shall be eligible for
a utility users tax rebate if, after January 1, 2000, it meets the criteria of
at least two of the categories below:
         (a)   Category A: Expansion Criteria:
            1.   The business expands by completing a permitted expansion at
its current location, resulting in an increase of at least 25% of the current
construction valuation of the existing building; or
            2.   The business relocates within the city, and the relocation is
to a facility with at least 25% more square feet than the previous location.
         (b)   Category B: Job Criteria: the business creates and maintains at
least five new, permanent, full-time jobs (50% of such new jobs shall pay at
least $25,000 per year in wages and/or commissions, except that the dollar
requirement for said jobs shall not apply to manufacturing and distribution
businesses) in addition to the jobs already existing at the current location(s)
within the city, and sustains that job increase over the previous 12 month
period prior to the application for the rebate.
         (c)   Category C: Sales Tax Criteria: the business generates at least
$10,000 more in sales or use tax revenues to the city than was generated in the
previous 12-month period prior to application for the rebate.
         (d)   If qualified under this section, the business shall be eligible
for a rebate on the amount of paid utility users tax paid by such business on
electrical, gas, video and telephone communication services, imposed by this
chapter according to the following schedule:
            1.   First year: 75% rebate;
            2.   Second year: 50% rebate;
            3.   Third year: 25% rebate; and
            4.   Fourth and subsequent years: no rebate.
         (e)   In no case shall any qualified business receive a rebate that
exceeds the amount of additional sales or use tax revenues received by the city
during the previous 12-month period prior to application for the rebate.
Additionally, if the business is receiving assistance from the Economic
Development Agency under an owner participation agreement (“OPA”) or
disposition and development agreement (“DDA”), and the combined annual value of
Agency assistance provided together with proposed utility tax rebate exceeds
the amount of additional annual sales tax revenue to the city, then the
business shall not be eligible for the rebate.
      (2)   Any business currently operating in the city, and not qualified
under division (B)(1) above or division (B)(3) below, shall be eligible for a
utility users tax rebate if it creates, after January 1, 2000 and maintains at
least 50 new, permanent, full-time jobs (50% of such new jobs shall pay at
least $25,000 per year in wages and/or commissions, except that the dollar
requirement for said jobs shall not apply to manufacturing and distribution
businesses) in addition to the jobs already existing at the current location(s)
within the city, and sustains that job increase over the previous 12-month
period prior to application for the rebate. If qualified, the business shall be
eligible for a rebate of utility users tax paid on the following scale:
         (a)   First year: 75% rebate;
         (b)   Second year: 50% rebate;
         (c)   Third year: 25% rebate; and
         (d)   Fourth and subsequent years: no rebate.
      (3)   Any business currently operating in the city shall be eligible for
a utility users tax rebate if, after January 1, 2000, it adds a new additional
location within the city, and continues to operate the previously existing
location or locations within the city for the previous 12-month period prior to
application for the rebate. For purposes of this program, the additional
location shall be considered “new business” and shall be eligible for rebates
in accordance with the program already established for new businesses (division
(A) above).
      (4)   Any business currently operating in the city and qualified under
divisions (B)(1) or (B)(2) above shall also be eligible for an additional
rebate of 1% on the amount of utility users tax paid for each city resident
that is hired to fill the new, permanent full-time jobs created within the city
that meet the wage criteria. Eligibility for any such additional rebates shall
be established by determining the residency of the new employees at the end of
each year of rebate eligibility. This determination shall be verified by the
Economic Development Agency with such supporting documentation as may be
required by the Economic Development Agency. In no case shall the total rebate
paid to any claimant exceed the total amount of utility users tax paid for the
period claimed, nor shall rebates be paid for any term other than the schedule
established by this section.
      (5)   To claim a rebate under this section, the claimant shall submit a
completed verified claim form to the Economic Development Agency with such
supporting documentation as may be required by the Economic Development Agency
to determine claimant’s eligibility and to establish the amount of utility
users tax paid by claimant on the period claimed, and the commencement date of
the “first year,” as that term is used herein. A claim for a rebate shall be
submitted annually to the Economic Development Agency not later than three
months after the close of the year for which such refund is sought. The
verified claim must be signed by an authorized officer of the claimant. The
rebate shall be paid at the recommendation of the Economic Development Agency
and subject to approval of the Department of Finance and Management Services.
      (6)   No rebates shall be paid if the subject business is no longer in
operation in the city.
      (7)   FIRST YEAR, as used in this section, shall mean, for an existing
business, the 12-month period immediately proceeding following the date the
claim for rebate is filed.

§ 3.44.135 REFUNDS BY SERVICE PROVIDED.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, whenever a
service supplier, pursuant to an order of the State Public Utilities Commission
or a court of competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of
charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this chapter on
the amount of such refund charges shall also be refunded to service users, and
the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for such refunded
taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly returns. In
the event this chapter is repealed prior to the time that the service supplier
has received credit for such refunded taxes, then the city shall pay the amount
of refunded taxes due.
   (B)   Prior to making any refund pursuant to division (A) above, the service
supplier shall provide, in the time and manner prescribed by the City
Administrator, a copy of the order of the State Public Utilities Commission (or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) mandating the refund and any
other relevant material or information.

§ 3.44.140 REFUNDS - LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF MOBILE-HOME PARKS WITH MASTER
METERS.
   (A)   A refund of all taxes due and paid under the provisions of this
chapter for utility services rendered on and after January 1, 1984 to residents
of mobile-home parks whose utility services were charged through a master meter
shall be made whenever all of the following occur:
      (1)   The annual gross income of the household in which one person lives
is less than an amount set by the Mayor and City Council by resolution;
      (2)   The annual gross income of the household in which a married couple

resolution;
      (3)   The claimant makes application and files a verified claim in
writing with the Director of Finance and Management Services at City Hall for
such refund upon a claim form provided by said Director; and/or
      (4)   The claim is approved by said Director as being in conformance with
this division (A). Only one member of each household may file a claim and only
one claim may be filed for each individual household.
   (B)   The claimant shall be the person in whose name the bills for utilities
service were rendered. INCOME OF THE HOUSEHOLD means an income of the
claimant’s household from all members living in such household who are related
to the claimant as a spouse or as defined in the Cal. Revenue and Taxation
Code, §§ 17056 and 17057.
   (C)   GROSS INCOME means the sum of adjusted gross income as used for

which refund is claimed or for any prior period. No refund shall be made for
any tax which was paid with public assistance or relief funds which included an
allowance to pay the tax.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that any utility
company has any obligation to make or furnish, for the purpose of the refund
provisions hereof, proof of utility taxes due or utility taxes paid.

§ 3.44.144 EXEMPTION FOR HOUSEHOLD SERVICE USERS - LOW INCOME.
   (A)   Effective January 1, 1984, the tax imposed by this chapter shall not
apply to any individual who uses telephone, electric, gas or cable television
services in or upon any premises occupied by such individual provided that the
following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The annual gross income of the household in which one person lives
is less than an amount set by the Mayor and City Council by resolution;
      (2)   The annual gross income of the household in which a married couple
or family lives is less than an amount set by the Mayor and City Council by
resolution; and/or
      (3)   The conditions of §
3.44.140(A)(3), (A)(4), (B), (C) and (F) are satisfied, with the word
“claimant” therein referring to the individual applying for exemption.
   (B)   Any person claiming exemption pursuant to this section may file a
claim for such exemption at any time in order to qualify for an exemption for
the subsequent 12-month period, or until a current exemption is scheduled to
expire.
      (1)   Between October 31, 1985 and the effective date of this division
(B), applications for renewal of exemptions may be made to the Director of
Finance and Management Services, without prejudice, by persons whose exemptions
were scheduled to expire on December 31, 1985. Exemptions granted under this
provision shall not be retroactive.
      (2)   An application for exemption or renewal shall be made upon forms
supplied by the Director of Finance and Management Services and shall declare
facts under penalty of perjury which qualify the applicant for the exemption.
   (C)   The Director of Finance and Management Services, or his or her
designee, shall review all applications for exemption or renewal, certify as
exempt those applicants who qualify and notify all service suppliers affected
that such exemptions have been approved, stating the name of the exempt
applicant, the account number shown on the utility bill, the address to which
exempt service is being supplied and any other information necessary for the
service supplier to remove the exempt service user from its tax billing
procedure. Upon receipt of notice from the Director of Finance and Management
Services, the service supplier shall not be required to collect any further tax
imposed by this chapter from such exempt service user until further notice from
the Director of Finance and Management Services. Prior to the expiration date
of each exemption, the Director of Finance and Management Services shall send
notice, by ordinary mail, reminding the holder of the expiration date. At the
same time, the Director of Finance and Management Services may also send a
renewal application which may be returned by ordinary mail. These reminders
shall be sent within such reasonable time as to allow processing of the renewal
with no lapse in the exemption status.
   (D)   Each exemption shall expire 12 months after the date it was issued, or
December 31, 1986, whichever date is later. The Director of Finance and
Management Services shall notify each service supplier to resume collection of
utility taxes on the accounts of those service users who have not applied for
renewal of their exempt status or whose applications for renewal have been
denied. Upon receipt of the written notification, these service suppliers shall
resume such collection on those accounts affected commencing with the first
billing period beginning after the exemption expires. Notwithstanding any of
the provisions of this section, any service supplier who determines, during any
calendar year, by any means readily available to it, that a non-exempt service
user is receiving services through a meter or connection exempt by virtue of an
exemption issued to a previous user of the same meter or connection, the
service supplier shall forthwith resume the collection of taxes imposed by this
chapter upon the non-exempt service user.
   (E)   Any individual who has been exempted from the tax shall notify the
Director of Finance and Management Services within ten days of any change of
address or any other change in fact or circumstance which might disqualify that
individual from receiving the exemption. If it is determined by the Director of
Finance and Management Services that the individual is no longer qualified, the
Director of Finance and Management Services shall give notice to the service
supplier who shall resume collection of the tax imposed by this chapter
commencing with the next billing period. If the user is entitled to exemption
at a new address, the Director of Finance and Management Services shall notify
affected service suppliers of that fact.
   (F)   It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the
benefits of the exemptions provided by this section when the basis for the
exemption either does not exist or ceases to exist. The Director of Finance and
Management Services may, from time to time, or at any time, demand evidence of
continued eligibility of a service user for exemption under the provisions of
this section. Such evidence may include, without limit, copies of business
records, letters or statements from the Social Security Administration; copies
of income tax returns; and other evidence concerning the service user or
members of his or her household which may tend to prove or disprove
eligibility. Failure to provide sufficient evidence to establish eligibility
when requested by the Director of Finance and Management Services shall be
grounds for denial or discontinuance of the service users’ exemption, but
evidence voluntarily provided to the Director of Finance and Management
Services may only be used as grounds for termination of the exemption and not
as evidence of violation of the provisions of this section. If the Director of
Finance and Management Services determines that an application for exemption is
faulty or untruthful, the application shall be denied in writing and the
applicant may file an amended application or appeal the decision of the
Director of Finance and Management Services to the City Administrator, whose
decision shall be final.
   (G)   No individual shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter
except in accordance with this section. The provisions of this section shall
not apply retroactively, and no refund shall be made for any taxes paid prior
to the issuance and effective date of an exemption granted by the Director of
Finance and Management Services, nor shall any refund be made for any taxes
collected during any period in which an exemption from the Director of Finance
and Management Services was not in effect or had lapsed by failure to apply for
renewal.

General Fund for that budget, as determined by a written declaration filed by

(Ord. MC-1625, passed 2-21-2024)
§ 3.46.030 CONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon any
person or service when the imposition of such tax upon such person or service
would be in violation of a federal or state statute, the U.S. Constitution or
the California Constitution.
   (B)   Due to the status of the San Bernardino City Unified School District
as an agency established by the City Charter and due to the strong public
policy in favor of encouraging and assisting the provision of public education,
public schools are exempted from the imposition of the communications users
tax.
   (C)   Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter
pursuant to division (A) above shall file an application with the Tax
Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not
apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a
commonly recognized name for such service. Said application shall be made upon
a form approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state those facts, declared
under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and
shall include the names of all communication service suppliers serving that
service user. If deemed exempt by the Tax Administrator, such service user
shall give the Tax Administrator timely written notice of any change in utility
service suppliers so that the Tax Administrator can properly notify the new
communication service supplier of the service users tax exempt status. A
service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be entitled to a
refund of such taxes collected and remitted to the Tax Administrator from such
service user as a result of such non-compliance. Upon request of the Tax
Administrator, a service supplier or its billing agent shall provide a list of
the names and addresses of those customers which, according to its billing
records, are deemed exempt from the communication users tax. The decision of
the Tax Administrator may be appealed by filing an application with the Tax
Administrator and appeal to the City Manager. The City Manager shall give
notice of and conduct an informed hearing and shall render a decision in
writing. Such hearing is a prerequisite to a suit herein.
   (D)   The exemption and rebate provisions of §§
3.44.140 and
3.44.144 shall apply to this chapter.
§ 3.46.040 COMMUNICATION USERS TAX.
   (A)   There is imposed a tax upon every person in the city using
communication services. The maximum tax imposed by this section shall be at the
rate of 7.75% of the charges made for such services and shall be collected from
the service user by the communication services supplier or its billing agent.
There is a rebuttable presumption that communication services, which are billed
to a billing or service address in the city, are used, in whole or in part,
within the boundaries of the city, and such services are subject to taxation
under this chapter. If the billing address of the service user is different
from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used
for purposes of imposing the tax. As used in this section, the term CHARGES
shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind
or nature or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for
the communication services.
   (B)   “Mobile telecommunications service” shall be sourced in accordance
with the sourcing rules set forth in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act
(4 U.S.C. §§ 116 et seq.), as the same exists or may be amended from time to
time. The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to communication service
suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this
chapter, sourcing rules for the taxation of other communication services,
including, but not limited to, post-paid communication services, prepaid
communication services and private communication services; provided that such
rules are based upon custom and common practice that further administrative
efficiency and minimize multi-jurisdictional taxation (e.g., streamlined sales
and use tax agreement).
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to communication
service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this
chapter, an administrative ruling identifying those communication services, or
charges therefor, that are subject to or not subject to the tax of division (A)
above.
   (D)   As used in this section, the term TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES shall
include, but is not limited to, charges for: connection, reconnection,
termination, movement or change of telecommunication services; late payment
fees; detailed billing; central office and custom calling features (including,
but not limited to, call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and
three-way calling); voice mail and other messaging services; directory
assistance; access and line charges; universal service charges; regulatory,
administrative and other cost recovery charges; local number portability
charges; and text and instant messaging. TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES shall not
include digital downloads that are not “ancillary telecommunications services,”
such as books, music, ringtones, games and similar digital products.
   (E)   Charges for communication services (video) shall include, but are not
limited to, charges for the following:
      (1)   Regulatory fees and surcharges, franchise fees and access fees
(“PEG”);
      (2)   Franchise fees;
      (3)   Initial installation of equipment necessary for provision and
receipt of communication services;
      (4)   Late fees, collection fees, bad debt recoveries and returned check
fees;
      (5)   Activation fees, reactivation fees and reconnection fees;
      (6)   All video programming services (e.g., basic services, premium
services, audio services, video games, pay-per-view services or on-demand
programming);
      (7)   Ancillary programming services (e.g., electronic program guide
services, search functions or other interactive services or communications that
are ancillary, necessary or common to the use or enjoyment of the video
programming);
      (8)   Equipment leases (e.g., converters, remote devices); and
      (9)   Service calls, service protection plans, name changes, changes of
services and special services.
   (F)   To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of communication
services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the
Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in
another state or local jurisdiction on such communication services, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such
tax legally imposed in such other state or local jurisdiction; provided,
however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the city under
this section.
   (G)   The tax on communication services imposed by this section shall be
collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax
collected in one month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the
following month.
§ 3.46.050 BUNDLING TAXABLE ITEMS WITH NON-TAXABLE ITEMS.
   Except as otherwise provided by applicable federal or state law, if any non-
taxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable
service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the
combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies, by
reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge that
are non-taxable and taxable through the service supplier’s books and records
kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax
purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper
apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges. If the service supplier
offers a combination of services that include taxable and non-taxable services
or products, and the charges are separately stated, then for taxation purposes,
the values assigned the taxable and non-taxable services or products shall be
based on its books and records kept in the regular course of business and in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and
maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the
proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges.
§ 3.46.060 SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS/MINIMUM CONTACTS.
   For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a
tax under this chapter, “substantial nexus” and “minimum contacts” shall be
construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of
the service users tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law,
and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by
statutory enactment. Any communication service (including VoIP) used by a
person with a service address in the city, which service is capable of
terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be
subject to a rebuttable presumption that “substantial nexus/minimum contacts”
exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and
remit a tax, under this chapter. A service supplier shall be deemed to have
sufficient activity in the city for tax collection and remittance purposes if
its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains
or has within the city, directly or through an agent or subsidiary, a place of
business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees, independent
contractors, resellers, agents or other representatives; solicits business in
the city on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of
advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter within the city or
distributed from a location within the city; or advertises in newspapers or
other periodicals printed and published within the city or through materials
distributed in the city by means other than the United States mail.
§ 3.46.070 DUTY TO COLLECT - PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Collection by service suppliers. The duty of service suppliers to
collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be
performed as follows.
      (1)   The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as
practicable at the same time as, and along with, the collection of the charges
made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.
Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the
full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a
proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been
paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of
refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, §
3.46.090 shall apply.
      (2)   The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service
user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period
applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such
regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a service
user receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods
than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing
period.
   (B)   Filing return and payment. Each person required by this chapter to
remit a tax shall file a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by
the Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax
collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional
information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being
levied, collected and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are due
immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Cal. Revenue
and Taxation Code, § 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall
maintain such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from
the disclosure provisions of the State Public Records Act (Cal. Gov’t Code, §§
6500 et seq.).
Editor’s note:
   Taxpayer information received in connection with collection of local taxes
may be exempt from PRA under Cal. Gov’t Code, §7925.000 (2023) (formerly Cal.
Gov’t Code, § 6254(i)); I.R.C. § 6103.
§ 3.46.080 COLLECTION PENALTIES - SERVICE SUPPLIERS.
   (A)   Taxes collected from a service user are delinquent if not received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a
weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the Tax Administrator
on the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A
direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods
of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a
service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this division (A)
shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due
date, and the transfer settles into the city’s account on the following
business day.
   (B)   If the person required to collect and/or remit the service users tax
fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more
services or charges on the customer’s billing) or fails to remit the tax
collected on or before the due date, the Tax Administrator shall attach a
penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of 15% of the total
tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay interest
at the rate of and 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of
the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent, until paid.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional
penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or
remitting at the rate of 15% of the amount of the tax collected and/or required
to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.
   (D)   For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest
that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the
tax herein required to be paid.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator may, in his or
her discretion, modify the due dates of this chapter to be consistent with any
uniform standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by other public
agencies imposing a service users tax, or otherwise legally established, to
create a central payment location or mechanism.
§ 3.46.090 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such
tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax
Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to
collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person
owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in
an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount,
including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with
any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person’s non-
compliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys’ fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed
by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation pursuant to 11
U.S.C. § 507(a)(8)(C).
§ 3.46.100 DEFICIENCY DETERMINATION AND ASSESSMENT - TAX APPLICATION ERRORS.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or
she determines that any service supplier or service user required to pay,
collect and/or remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter has
failed to pay, collect and/or remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or
failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges. Nothing
herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under
this section if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of
collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency
determination to the person or entity allegedly owing the tax, which notice
shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate
of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the
date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within 14 calendar
days after the date of service of such notice, the person or entity allegedly
owing the tax may request in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on
the matter.
   (C)   If the person or entity allegedly owing the tax fails to request a
hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency
determination shall become final assessment, and shall immediately be due and
owing to the city. If the person requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator
shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be scheduled within
30 days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time
and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax Administrator to such
person or entity at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the
Tax Administrator desires said person or entity to produce specific records at
such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced.
   (D)   At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear
all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested
parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be
continued, from time to time, for the purpose of allowing the presentation of
additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the
hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-
assessment) thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original
deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to
person or entity owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be
appealed pursuant to §
3.46.150. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the
City Manager is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
   (E)   Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth day following the
date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency
shall be 15% on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the
rate of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The
applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the city seeking payment
of a tax assessed under this chapter shall commence from the date of
delinquency as provided in this division (E).
   (F)   All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage
prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the
date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing.
§ 3.46.110 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY - NON-PAYING SERVICE USERS.
   (A)   Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has
deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the
amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax
Administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve
such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from
certain named service users for specific billing periods. To the extent the
service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two or
more billing periods, the service supplier may, in the discretion of the Tax
Administrator, be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service
supplier shall provide the city with the names and addresses of such service
users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this chapter if it
is determined by the Tax Administrator to relieve the person required to
collect the tax. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator
institute proceedings under this section if, in the opinion of the Tax
Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax
benefit.
   (B)   In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency
penalty at the rate of 15% of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay
interest at the rate of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator shall notify the non-paying service user that
the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due
for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties
and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal
delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made
by the person required to collect the tax; or should the service user have a
change of address, to his or her last known address.
   (D)   If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator
within 30 days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the
Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of 15% of the amount of the
total tax that is owed.
§ 3.46.120 ADDITIONAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty and is directed to
enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations
consistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting,
clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance
of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such administrative rules and
regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office.
   (C)   Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make
administrative agreements approved by the City Attorney, with appropriate
conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby:
      (1)   Conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier
so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance
with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or
      (2)   To avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection
and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to
collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax Administrator
shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the
absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review
shall not exceed a period of three years next preceding the date of receipt of
the written notice by said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion
of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination,
pursuant to §
3.46.100, for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed and not
paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax
Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient
records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter,
the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the
deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable
presumption of correctness.
   (E)   (1)   Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good
cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement
required pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed 45 days;
provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed
when the request is received.
      (2)   No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such
extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of 0.75% per
month, prorated for any portion thereof.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person
who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this
chapter.
   (G)   Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the Tax
Administrator, with the approval of the Mayor and City Council, may waive any
penalty or interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for
failure to collect the tax imposed by this chapter if the non-collection
occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-collection was in good
faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or
other precedence.
§ 3.46.130 RECORDS.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit
to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period
of at least three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the
amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and
remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator shall
have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.
   (B)   The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to
deliver, to the Tax Administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by
the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the
delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if
such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary
course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to
the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative
subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the city on or
before the due date; provided that such person shall reimburse the city for all
reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect those records,
including travel, lodging, meals and other similar expenses, but excluding the
normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to
conduct the inspection.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure
agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the confidentiality of
customer information pursuant to Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, §§ 7284.6 and
7284.7.
   (D)   If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to
bill, collect and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall:
      (1)   Provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone
number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the
service supplier to bill, collect and/or remit the tax to the city; and
      (2)   Upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the
delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent
or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is
necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or
remittance of such tax to the city.
   (E)   (1)   If any person subject to record-keeping under this section
unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator access to such records, or fails to
produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time
specified, then the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of $500 on such
person for each day following:
         (a)   The initial date that the person refuses to provide such access;
or
         (b)   The due date for production of records as set forth in the
administrative subpoena.
      (2)   This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed
under this chapter.
§ 3.46.140 REFUNDS.
   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or
has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax
Administrator under this chapter from a service user or service supplier, it
may be refunded as provided in this section.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid or
paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received
by the Tax Administrator under this chapter from a service user or service
supplier; provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this
section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor or
administrator has submitted a written claim to the Tax Administrator within one
year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such
claim must clearly establish claimant’s right to the refund by written records
showing entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim
on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers unless each member of the class has
submitted a written claim under penalty of perjury as provided by this division
(A).
   (B)   The filing of a written claim pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code, § 935 is a
prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action brought against the city pursuant
to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 945.6
and 946. The City Manager, or the Mayor and City Council where the claim is in
excess of $10,000, shall act upon the refund claim within the time period set
forth in Cal. Gov’t Code, § 912.4. If the City Manager/Mayor and City Council
fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the time prescribed by Cal.
Gov’t Code, § 912.4, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the
City Manager/Mayor and City Council on the last day of the period within which
the City Manager/Mayor and City Council was required to act upon the claim as
provided in Cal. Gov’t Code, § 912.4. The Risk Manager shall give notice of the
action in a form which substantially complies with that set forth in Cal. Gov’t
Code, § 913.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the notice provisions of division (A) above, a service
supplier that has collected any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax
imposed by this chapter and actually due from a service user (whether due to
overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax) may refund such
amount to the service user, or credit to charges subsequently payable by the
service user to the service supplier, and claim credit for such overpayment
against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns to the
Tax Administrator; provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later
than one year from the date of overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection
of said tax, and provided that the Tax Administrator shall first determine the
validity of the service user’s claim of credit and the underlying basis for
such claim.
   (D)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) through (C) above, a service supplier
shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit against an underpayment
whenever such overpayment has been received by the city within the three years
next preceding a deficiency determination or assessment by the Tax
Administrator in connection with an audit instituted by the Tax Administrator
pursuant to §
3.46.120(D). A service supplier shall not be entitled to said credit unless it
clearly establishes the right to the credit by written records showing
entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a
credit against an underpayment pursuant to this division (D) qualify a service
supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the
one-year written claim requirement of this section.
§ 3.46.150 APPEALS.
   (A)   The provisions of this section apply to any decision (other than a
decision relating to a refund pursuant to §
3.46.140), deficiency determination, assessment or administrative ruling of the
Tax Administrator. Any person aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision
relating to a refund pursuant to §
3.46.140), deficiency determination, assessment or administrative ruling of the
Tax Administrator shall be required to comply with the appeals procedure of
this section. Compliance with this section shall be a prerequisite to a suit
thereon. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim or action on behalf
of a class or group of taxpayers.
   (B)   If any person is aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision
relating to a refund pursuant to §
3.46.140), deficiency determination, assessment or administrative ruling of the
Tax Administrator, he or she may appeal to the City Manager by filing a notice
of appeal with the City Clerk within 14 days of the date of the decision,
deficiency determination, assessment, administrative ruling of the Tax
Administrator which aggrieved the service user or service supplier.
   (C)   The matter shall be scheduled for hearing before an independent
hearing officer selected by the City Manager, no more than 45 days from the
receipt of the appeal. The appellant shall be served with notice of the time
and place of the hearing, as well as any relevant materials, at least five
calendar days prior to the hearing. The hearing may be continued, from time to
time, upon mutual consent. At the time of the hearing, the appealing party, the
Tax Administrator and any other interested person may present such relevant
evidence as he or she may have relating to the determination from which the
appeal is taken.
   (D)   Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the
city’s files, the hearing officer shall issue a written notice and order
upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is
taken. The notice shall be given within 14 days after the conclusion of the
hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall specify
that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be
filed within 90 days from the date of the decision in accordance with Cal. Code
of Civil Procedure, § 1094.6.
   (E)   All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage
prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the
date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing.
§ 3.46.160 NO INJUNCTION/WRIT OF MANDATE.
   No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall
issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against this city or
against any officer of the city to prevent or enjoin the collection under this
chapter of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected and/or
remitted.
§ 3.46.170 NOTICE OF CHANGES TO ORDINANCE.
   If a tax under this chapter is added, repealed, increased by voter approval,
reduced or the tax base is changed, the Tax Administrator shall follow the
notice requirements of Cal. Public Utilities Code, § 799.
§ 3.46.180 FUTURE AMENDMENT TO CITED STATUTE.
   Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a state or federal
statute in this chapter shall mean such statute as it may be amended from time
to time.
§ 3.46.190 INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF TAX COLLECTION, EXEMPTION, REMITTANCE AND
EXPENDITURE.
   The city shall annually verify that the taxes owed under this chapter have
been properly applied, exempted, collected and remitted in accordance with this
chapter, and properly expended according to applicable municipal law. The
annual verification shall be performed by a qualified independent third party
and the review shall employ reasonable, cost-effective steps to assure
compliance, including the use of sampling audits. The verification shall not be
required of tax remitters where the cost of the verification may exceed the tax
revenues to be reviewed.
§ 3.46.200 NO INCREASE IN TAX PERCENTAGE OR CHANGE IN METHODOLOGY WITHOUT VOTER
APPROVAL.
   (A)   Regarding §
3.46.040, the city may not increase the tax percentage or change a methodology
for calculating the tax so as to result in an increase in a tax imposed on a
person, without voter approval.
   (B)   Notwithstanding division (A) above, pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code, §
53750, the city may make the following changes without voter approval:
      (1)   Reduce the percentage rate, and at any time thereafter increase
such percentage rate, so long as the subsequent increase does not exceed the
rate previously approved by the voters in the enactment of this chapter;
      (2)   Change the methodology so as to reduce the amount of the tax being
levied, and, at any time thereafter, change the methodology, so long as the
subsequent change in methodology does not result in an increase in the amount
being levied under the methodology previously approved by the voters in the
enactment of this chapter;
      (3)   Change a methodology or definition so as to avoid or eliminate a
discriminatory tax on taxpayers that are similarly situated, so long as the
change does not result in an increase in the amount levied on such class of
similarly situated taxpayers under the methodology or definition previously
approved by the voters in the enactment of this chapter;
      (4)   Establish a class of persons that is exempt or excepted from one or
more taxes hereunder, and, at any time thereafter, discontinue such exemption
or exception;
      (5)   Decide that all or a part of a tax imposed under §
3.46.040 should not be enforced for administrative reasons, and, at any time
thereafter, decide to enforce the full amount of such tax as previously
approved by the voters in the enactment of this chapter;
      (6)   Establish, and, at any time thereafter, change, the value and/or
apportionment (including a “safe harbor” percentage) of taxable and non-taxable
services that are bundled or packaged under a combined charge, in response to
changes in the marketing of combined services and the components thereof, or in
reevaluating the values thereof; or
      (7)   Establish exemptions or lower rate percentages for industrial or
economic development zones or for classes of customers therein, establish
rebate programs for the purposes of encouraging economic development and, at
any time thereafter, discontinue such exemptions or lower rate percentages.
§ 3.46.210 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.
   All remedies and penalties prescribed by this chapter or which are available
under any other provision of law or equity, including, but not limited to, the
State False Claims Act (Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 12650 et seq.) and the State Unfair
Practices Act (Cal. Business and Professions Code, §§ 17070 et seq.), are
cumulative. The use of one or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use
of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this
chapter.
§ 3.46.220 INTERACTION WITH PRIOR TAX.
   (A)   Collection of tax by service providers. Service providers shall begin
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter as soon as feasible after the
effective date of this chapter, but, in no event, later than permitted by the
Cal. Public Utilities Code, § 799.
   (B)   Satisfaction of tax obligation by service users. Any person who pays
the tax levied pursuant to §
3.46.040 with respect to any charge for a communication service shall be deemed
to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied, pursuant to §§
3.44.030 and
3.44.040, with respect to that charge. Likewise, prior to August 1, 2008, any
person who pays the tax levied pursuant to §§
3.44.030 and
3.44.040 with respect to any charge for a service subject to taxation pursuant
to this chapter shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay
the tax levied pursuant to §
3.46.040 with respect to that charge. The intent of this division (B) is to
prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge during
the transition period from the prior telephone and video users’ tax to the new
communications users’ tax (which transition period ends August 1, 2008) and to
permit communications service providers, during that transition period, to
satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax.
§ 3.46.230 VIOLATION - PENALTY.
   Any person violating any provision of this chapter is guilty of an
infraction, which, upon conviction thereof, is punishable in accordance with
the provisions of §
1.12.010.

Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, §§ 7280 and 7281
§ 3.55.010 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   HOTEL. A commercial establishment furnishing lodging space in exchange for
monetary compensation. Every such establishment shall constitute a HOTEL for
purposes of this chapter notwithstanding any advertising describing the
facility as a hostelry, inn, motel, rooming house, tourist home or similar
enterprise.
   LODGING SPACE. One or more rooms used or intended to be used for dwelling or
sleeping purposes.
   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of
a lodging space.
   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of a hotel. If an OPERATOR

chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall constitute
compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,

   TRANSIENT. A person who, for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or
less, exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession,
permit, right of access, license or contract. Every such person shall
constitute a TRANSIENT for purposes of this chapter until expiration of the 30-
day period, unless such person has executed a written contract with the
operator to provide for occupancy in excess of 30 consecutive calendar days and
the contract cannot be terminated without providing at least 30 days’ advance
notice. In determining whether a person is a TRANSIENT, portions of calendar
days shall be counted as full days and uninterrupted periods of time extending
both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be
considered.
   TRANSIENT LODGING TAX. The tax levied pursuant to this chapter.
§ 3.55.020 TAX IMPOSED - RATE - REVENUE MEASURE.
   (A)   For the privilege of occupancy in a hotel, each transient is subject
to and shall pay a transient lodging tax in the amount of 10% of the room
rental charged by the operator.
   (B)   The transient lodging tax is levied for revenue purposes and is
necessary for the usual financial operation of the city. When collected, the
tax shall be made a part of the General Funds of the city.
§ 3.55.030 COLLECTION OF TAX.

§ 3.56.020 PURPOSE.
   The Mayor and City Council declare that the ordinance codified in this
chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and direct

   (A)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code,
Division 2, Part 1.5;

identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the state insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, Division 2, Part 1.5;
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a 1% tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State
Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practical to,
and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the state sales and use taxes; and
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of the
said Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, Division 2, Part 1.5, minimize the cost of
collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
record-keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
chapter.

tax is imposed upon retailers in the city at the rate of 1% of the gross
receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold
at retail in the city on and after the operative date of the ordinance codified

The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such
charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to

rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the Board of

   (A)   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, Division 2, Part 1.6
(commencing with § 7251) and Division 2, Part 1.7, § 7285.9 which authorizes
the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of
the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at

   (B)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the state insofar
as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations
contained in the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, Division 2, Part 1.6;

tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by

from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
State Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and collecting
the state sales and use taxes; and
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, Division

and at the same time, minimize the burden of record-keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in

§ 5.04.005 REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE.
   It is unlawful for any person, whether as principal or agent, clerk or
employee, either for himself or herself or for any other person, or for any
body corporate, or as an officer of any corporation, or otherwise, to commence
or carry on any business, show, exhibition or game, specified in this article,
in the city, without first having procured a registration certificate from the
city and without complying with any and all regulations of such business, show,
exhibition or game contained in this article; and the carrying on of any
business, show, exhibition or game mentioned in this article without first
having procured a registration certificate from the city, and without complying
with any and all regulations of such business, show, exhibition or game
contained in this article shall constitute a separate violation of this article
for each and every day that such business, show, exhibition or game is so
carried on.
(Ord. 763, passed 3-2-1920; Ord. MC-817, passed 1-7-1992; Ord. MC-1039, passed
1-12-1999)
§ 5.04.010 FEE - DEEMED DEBT.
   The amount of any fee imposed by this article shall be deemed as debt to the
city; and any person, firm or corporation carrying on any business, show,
exhibition or game mentioned in this article without having a business
registration certificate from the city shall be liable to an action in the name
of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction, for the amount of the fee
imposed by this article on such business, show, exhibition or game.
(Ord. 763, passed 3-2-1920; Ord. MC-817, passed 1-7-1992)
§ 5.04.015 BUSINESS REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE - APPLICATION - ISSUANCE.
   (A)   Before any business registration certificate is issued to any person,
firm or corporation, such person, firm or corporation shall make written
application therefor to the City Clerk; such application must state the nature
or kind of business, show, exhibition or game for which the registration
certificate is required; the place where such business, show, exhibition or
game will be carried on or conducted; the name of the owner of the business,
show, exhibition or game; and must be signed by the applicant. In cases where
such business, show, exhibition or game is not to be conducted or carried on at
a permanent place of business in the city, then such application shall state
the residence of the owners of such business, show, exhibition or game.
   (B)   No registration certificate shall be issued to any corporation unless
its articles of incorporation, or a certified copy thereof, are filed in the
office of the County Clerk or in the office of the City Clerk.
   (C)   No registration certificate shall be issued to any person, firm or
partnership conducting or carrying on any business, show, exhibition or game,
under a fictitious name, unless an affidavit is filed in the office of the
County Clerk or in the office of the City Clerk showing the true names of the
owners of such business; provided, however, such certificate may be issued in
the true names of the owners of such business, show, exhibition or game without
the filing of such affidavit.
   (D)   (1)   The determination of which business or type or class of business
a business registration certificate holder or an applicant is engaged in shall
be an administrative function of the City Clerk.
      (2)   If a business registration certificate holder or an applicant
believes that his or her business is not assigned to the proper classification
under this chapter because of circumstances peculiar to it, as distinguished
from other businesses of the same kind, he or she may apply in writing to the
City Clerk for reclassification. The application shall contain such information
as the City Clerk deems necessary in order to determine whether the applicant’s
individual business is properly classified.
      (3)   The City Clerk shall then conduct an investigation following which
he or she shall assign the applicant’s individual business to the
classification shown to be proper on the basis of the investigation. The proper
classification is the classification which, in the opinion of the City Clerk,
most nearly fits the applicant’s individual business. The City Clerk shall
notify the applicant of the action taken on the application for
reclassification. Such notice shall be given by serving it personally or by
depositing it in the United States Post Office at San Bernardino, California,
postage prepaid, addressed to the applicant at his or her last known address.
   (E)   Each new or renewal business registration application shall be
accompanied by a non-refundable application processing fee established by
resolution of the Mayor and City Council which shall be no more than necessary
to cover the costs of processing. This fee shall be in addition to the business
registration fee and shall not be prorated. Daily and monthly business
registration applications shall be exempt from this requirement.
(Ord. 763, passed 3-2-1920; Ord. MC-817, passed 1-7-1992; Ord. MC-935, passed

§ 5.04.020 REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE - NON-TRANSFERABLE.
   (A)   Upon application therefor as provided in §
5.04.015, it shall be the duty of the City Clerk to prepare and issue a
business registration certificate hereunder, and to state in each certificate
the amount thereof; the period of time covered thereby; the name of the person,
firm or corporation to whom issued; the business, show, exhibition or game
registered; and the location or place of business where such business, show,
exhibition or game is to be carried on.
   (B)   No certificate granted or issued under any provision of this article
shall be transferred or assigned in any manner, nor is any person, firm or
corporation other than mentioned or named therein authorized to do business
without the written consent of the City Clerk endorsed thereon. At the time any
such business is assigned or transferred, the person applying for such transfer
shall make application for a registration certificate as provided in §
5.04.015, and shall pay a transfer fee of $5 to the City Clerk. In the event a
business location or mailing address is changed, the certificate holder shall
notify the City Clerk of such change and pay a fee of $5.
   (C)   The City Clerk shall make a charge of $0.50 for each duplicate
certificate issued to replace any certificate issued under the provisions of
this article which has been lost or destroyed, in no case shall any mistake
made by the City Clerk in stating the amount of a fee prevent or prejudice the
collection by the city of what shall be actually due from anyone carrying on a
business, show, exhibition or game subject to a registration certificate under
this chapter.
(Ord. 763, passed 3-2-1920; Ord. MC-302, passed 9-7-1983; Ord. MC-817, passed

§ 5.04.021 INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the City Clerk or any person having an
administrative duty under the provisions of this chapter to make known, in any
manner whatever, the business affairs, operations or information obtained by an
investigation of records and equipment of any person required to pay the
registration certificate fee, or any other person visited or examined in the
discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses,
expenditures or any particular thereof, set forth in any statement or
application, or to permit any statement or application, or copy of either, in
any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined
by any person.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent:
      (1)   The disclosure to, or the examination of records and equipment by,
another city official, employee or agent for collection of registration
certificate fees for the sole purpose of administering or enforcing any
provisions of this chapter, or collecting registration certificate fees imposed
hereunder;
      (2)   The disclosure of information to, or the examination of records by,
federal or state officials, or the tax officials of another city or county, or
city and county, if a reciprocal arrangement exists, or to a grand jury or
court of law, upon subpoena;
      (3)   The disclosure of information and results of examination of records
of particular certificate holders, or relating to particular certificate
holders, to a court of law in a proceeding brought to determine the existence
or amount of any registration certificate fee liability of the particular
certificate holder to the city;
      (4)   The disclosure, after the filing of a written request to that
effect, to a certificate holder, or to his or her successors, receivers,
trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly
interested, of information as to the items included in the measure of any paid
fee, any unpaid registration certificate fee or amounts of fees required to be
collected, interest and penalty; provided, however, that the City Attorney
approve each such disclosure and that the City Clerk may refuse to make any
disclosure referred to in this division (B)(4) when, in his or her opinion, the
public interest would suffer thereby;
      (5)   The disclosure of the names and addresses of persons to whom
certificates have been issued, and the general type or nature of their
business;
      (6)   The disclosure by way of public meeting or otherwise of such
information as may be necessary to the Mayor and City Council in order to
permit it to be fully advised as to the facts when a certificate holder files a
claim for refund of registration certificate fees, or submits an offer of
compromise with regard to a claim asserted against him or her by the city for
registration certificate fees, or when acting upon any other matter; and
      (7)   The disclosure of general statistics regarding fees collected or
business done in the city.

§ 5.04.025 BUSINESS REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE - OTHER PERMITS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation conducting or carrying on any
business, show, exhibition or game without having obtained a business
registration certificate as required by this article shall be nevertheless
liable for any fee or penalties imposed or required to be paid pursuant to §
5.04.010 for the period such business or activity was conducted without such
certificate.
   (B)   No business registration certificate shall be issued to any person,

Development Services Department. An approved copy of said zoning consistency
review shall be presented at the time of submitting this written application
for the business registration certificate.
   (C)   No registration certificate issued under the provisions of this
article shall be construed as authorizing the conduct or continuance of any
illegal or unlawful business or activity or the violation of any ordinance or
law. Any registration certificate issued contrary to the provisions of this
section shall be void and of no effect.
(Ord. 763, passed 3-2-1920; Ord. 3594, passed 8-3-1976; Ord. MC-817, passed 1-

§ 5.04.026 TRANSFERS OF STOCK OR PARTNERSHIP INTEREST.
   (A)   Any business registration certificate or any permit issued or granted
pursuant to this title is a privilege to be held by the original permittee or
certificate holder thereof. It cannot be sold, transferred, assigned or
disposed of, in whole or in part, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation
or otherwise.
   (B)   In the event a permittee or certificate holder is a corporation, a new
permit or certificate shall be required when there is an actual change in
control or when ownership of more than 50% of the voting stock of the permittee
or certificate holder is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in
concert, none of whom already own 50% or more of the voting stock, singly or
collectively.
   (C)   In the event a permittee or certificate holder is a partnership, a new
permit or certificate shall be required when there is an actual change in
control or when ownership of 50% or more of the capital or profits of the
permittee or certificate holder is acquired by a person or group of persons
acting in concert, none of whom already own 50% or more of such capital or
profits, singly or collectively.
(Ord. MC-936, passed 4-18-1995)
§ 5.04.030 BUSINESS REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE FEES - PAYABLE IN ADVANCE.
   (A)   All fees shall be paid in advance in legal currency of the United
States at the office of the City Clerk, or by check, draft or other instrument
in the discretion of the City Clerk. Any certificate, the fee for which has
been paid by an instrument, such as a check, draft or money order, which is
dishonored upon presentation for payment, shall be void and of no effect from
its inception, upon notice from the City Clerk of such dishonor. The City Clerk
may, in his or her discretion, withhold the effect of this provision if the fee
is promptly paid. Payment of registration certificate fees following a dishonor
of such an instrument upon presentment for payment shall thereafter be made
only by cashier’s check, money order or cash, which fee shall include any
applicable penalty, as well as the service fee under §
3.10.010 for such dishonored instrument. The City Clerk shall be authorized to
reject payment other than by cash, cashier’s check or money order from such
certificate holder for a period of two years following any such dishonor.
   (B)   A separate registration certificate must be obtained for each branch
establishment or separate place of business in which the business, show,
exhibition or game is carried on. Each registration certificate shall authorize
the party obtaining it to carry on, pursue or conduct only that business, show,
exhibition or game described in such certificate. Where a registration
certificate is required for any business, show, exhibition or game, and the
number of persons employed or the gross receipts of such business is made the
basis for fixing the amount of the registration certificate fee, a separate fee
shall be paid for each branch establishment or place of business in which the
business, show, exhibition or game is carried on, based upon the number of
persons employed in, or the gross receipts of, each branch establishment or
separate place of business.
   (C)   Monthly fees are due and payable on the first of each month in
advance, from all persons who have received a business registration certificate
for the previous month to carry on the same business, show, exhibition or game.
From all persons who have not received such a certificate for the previous
month for the same business, show, exhibition or game, the fee is due and
payable, and must be procured before commencing to carry on such business,
show, exhibition or game.
   (D)   Except as specified in division (H) below, quarterly fees are due and
payable to the city on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, and such
certificates expire on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each
year. All business registration certificates shall be reissued annually from
the date of initial issuance and the quarterly fees are due and payable every
three months beginning from the date of initial issuance.

§ 5.04.040 CONSTITUTIONAL APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   None of the fees provided for by this article shall be so applied as
to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the
equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. and California
Constitutions.
   (B)   In any case where a fee is believed by a certificate holder to place
an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional
clauses, the certificate holder may apply to the City Clerk for an adjustment
of the fee. Such belief shall not excuse failure to pay the applicable fee when
due. Such application may be made before, at the time of or within six months
after payment of the prescribed fee. A certificate holder shall, by sworn
statement and supporting testimony, show his or her method of business and the
gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information
as the City Clerk may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any,
of such undue burden or violation. The City Clerk shall then conduct an
investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the
City Attorney, shall fix, as the fee for the certificate holder, an amount that
is reasonable and non-discriminatory, and if the fee has already been paid,
shall order a refund of the amount over and above the fee so fixed. In fixing
the fee to be charged, the City Clerk shall have the power to base the fee upon
a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the
fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature,
so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the fee as prescribed by this
article. Should the City Clerk determine the gross receipts measure of license
fee to be proper basis, he or she may require the certificate holder to submit,
either at the time of termination of the certificate holder’s business in the
city, or at the end of each quarter, a sworn statement of the gross receipts
and pay the amount of the fee therefor; provided that no additional fee during
any one calendar year shall be required after the certificate holder shall have
paid an amount equal to the annual fee as prescribed in this article.

business, show, exhibition or game without a registration certificate shall not
excuse or exempt such person from the payment of any fee due or unpaid at the
time of such conviction, and nothing in this article shall prevent a criminal
prosecution for any violation of the provisions of this article.
   (B)   If, and in the event of, a failure of a person, firm or corporation
conducting, managing or carrying on a business to secure a registration
certificate and pay the fee therefor as provided in this article, or in the
event that a prohibited transient merchant is discovered, then the business

possession the items to be sold and to hold the same until such fees have been
paid and a certificate duly issued and properly displayed, or in the case of a
transient merchant, to hold the same until claimed by a responsible party
against whom legal action can be taken, whereupon the inspector shall release
the items confiscated.

such person fails to deny by a sworn statement under penalty of perjury given

business in the city, after being requested to do so by the inspector, then
these facts shall be considered prima facie evidence that he or she is
conducting a business in the city.

§ 5.04.055 FEES BASED ON GROSS RECEIPTS.
   (A)   In all cases where the fee to be paid by any person, firm or
corporation is based upon the amount of receipts or sales or of business
transacted, or upon the number of persons employed or upon the number of
vehicles used, or upon the amount of the maximum admission fee charged, or upon
the number of tables used for any game, or upon the number of rooms in any
building, such person, firm or corporation shall, before obtaining a
registration certificate for his or her, their or its business, and within ten
days after the beginning of each certificate period, if such business is
established or in operation during any part of such ten days, render to the
City Clerk, for his or her guidance in ascertaining the fee to be paid by such
person, firm or corporation, a written statement sworn to before some officer
authorized to administer oaths, showing the total amount of receipts of sales
or of business transacted during the calendar year next preceding the date of
such statement, or the number of vehicles used, or the amount of the maximum
admission fee charged, or the number of tables used for any game by such
person, firm or corporation, or the number of rooms contained in such building,
at the date of such statement; provided, however, that where the quarterly fee
to be paid under any section of this article is based upon the gross annual
receipts or of business transacted, or the gross annual commission of fees
received or collected, only one such statement need be filed at the time the
first quarterly registration certificate is procured, and the fee to be paid
for the succeeding quarterly periods of the year in which such statement is
filed shall be determined by and be based upon the statement filed at the time
the first quarterly registration certificate is procured.
   (B)   No such statement shall be conclusive upon the city or upon any
officer thereof as to the matter thereon set forth, and the same shall not
prejudice the right of the city to recover any amount that may be ascertained
to be due from such person, firm or corporation in addition to the amount shown
by such statement to be due in case such statement should be found to be
incorrect. If any person, firm or corporation required to make any such
statement fails to do so, such person, firm or corporation shall pay a fee at
the maximum rate prescribed in this article for the business, show, exhibition
or game carried on by such person, firm or corporation, and shall be guilty of
a violation of this article and be punishable therefor as hereinafter provided;
provided, however, that in any case where the first business registration
certificate is to be issued for a newly established business, no statement need
to be made, at the time such first certificate is issued, of the amount or
receipts of sales or business transacted and the minimum rate prescribed in
this article shall be paid at the time such first certificate is issued for any
such newly established business, the fee for which is regulated by the amount
of receipts or sales or the business transacted. At the end of the year during
which the operation of such business is commenced, the fee for the preceding
period shall be ascertained and paid. The amount of such fee shall be
ascertained by dividing the amount of the gross sales or receipts of such
business by the number of days during which such certificate has been in force
and multiplying the result by 365 and applying such result to the rate
applicable thereto to determine the fee and from this amount deduct the amount
previously paid. Such gross receipts so determined shall be the basis of the
fee for the next succeeding year.

provided, means the total amount of revenue received as the sale prices of all
sales and the total amount charged or received for the performance of any
action, service or employment of whatever nature it may be, for which a charge
is made or credit allowed, when such service, act or employment is done as a
part of or in connection with the sale of materials, goods, wares and
merchandise, or the performance of services; GROSS RECEIPTS includes all
receipts, cash, credits and property of any kind or nature, and any amount for

materials used, labor or service costs, interest paid or payable or losses or
other expenses whatsoever; GROSS RECEIPTS further includes commissions received

commissions of every person, firm or corporation conducting, managing, carrying

   If a person owns, leases, occupies or otherwise maintains within the city a
place or premises from which he or she engages in business activities outside
the city, he or she shall include a portion of the gross receipts from work
performed outside the city in the measure of the fee. In the absence of
substantial information to the contrary, 20% of gross receipts from work
performed outside the city shall be deemed to be that portion subject to the
fee as attributable to business engaged in within the city:
   (A)   Require the use of a greater percentage of such gross receipts,
stating in writing to the certificate holder his or her reasons therefor; or
   (B)   Approve the use of a lesser percentage of such gross receipts, based
upon proof presented to him or her in writing by the taxpayer that the 20%
factor is inequitable. Any such variation from the 20% factor established in
this provision shall be approved in writing by the City Clerk, or his or her
authorized representative. Where there are no measurable gross receipts
directly attributable to operations carried on from a place of business within
the city, such operations shall be deemed to produce gross receipts in an
amount at least equal to the cost of maintaining such operations, such cost of
operations shall include, but not be limited to, rent and/or depreciation,
salaries and wages, fixed charges and other expenses.

immediately following such period of six months or less of such preceding year,
the City Clerk, subject to the filing of a written request during the first
quarter of the subsequent year, shall give a credit for or authorize a rebate
of the amount such fee exceeded the actual gross receipts of the business as
determined by the City Clerk. The privilege of a credit or a rebate shall not
apply to any subsequent year, and the decision of the City Clerk shall be final
and conclusive.

persons engaged in business are required to permit such an examination of their
financial books and records for the purposes and under conditions aforesaid.

to any other penalty or remedy provided for by law, whether criminal or civil
in nature.

City Clerk, fails to file a corrected statement, the City Clerk, or a
designated representative, may determine the amount of the fee due from such

renew a certificate and has been delinquent for 90 days, an assessment of 10%
of the amount of the fee and penalties per month not to exceed 100% shall be
added hereto in addition to the penalties stated in division (C) above. The
assessment stated in this division (D) shall be instituted to cover escalating
costs incurred to pursue delinquent accounts requiring extended enforcement
action.
   (E)   It shall be the responsibility of each business owner to obtain and

agricultural products, vehicles, furniture or any other item or to offer any
service, from a temporary stand, or other temporary location, upon any public
street, alley, sidewalk, right-of-way, easement or other public place, doorway

for any business purpose, including retail sales, offices and suites or other
business rentals including mini-storage; or freight forwarding storehouse(s)
and warehouse(s); or operating hotel(s), rooming house(s), lodging house(s),
boardinghouse(s), apartment house(s), court motel(s), mobile home park(s); or
leasing or renting any residential dwelling unit(s), including single-family
home(s), shall obtain a business registration certificate and pay a fee
established by resolution of the Mayor and City Council.
      (2)   (a)   All businesses which conduct, manage or carry on the business
of leasing or renting of commercial or industrial building(s), land or space
(s), which are to be utilized for any business purpose, are required to furnish
a list of tenants or lessees for all such buildings to the City Clerk.
         (b)   The list of tenants shall be included with the business
registration certificate application or renewal application of the management
company.
      (3)   The intent of this section is to require a business registration
certificate for the business of leasing or renting commercial or industrial
building(s); for leasing or renting land; for leasing or renting office(s),
suite(s) or other business rental(s); and for leasing or renting dwelling unit
(s).
      (4)   (a)   For the leasing or renting of dwelling unit(s), a separate
business registration certificate shall be required for each legal parcel upon
which the rental unit(s) are located, unless the ownership of a building is
divided as provided in Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 66426 and 66427 as a condominium,
community apartment project or stock cooperative project, and then a separate
business registration certificate shall be required for each such division
where the owner owns less than four units in one complex. Where the owner owns
four or more such units located in the same complex, only one business
registration certificate shall be required. For the purposes of this section,
COMPLEX shall mean the land divided into condominiums, a community apartment
project or a stock cooperative project with any attendant common area and which
is treated together as unified whole.
         (b)   It shall be presumptive evidence that a single-family dwelling
is considered rented if the owner fails to claim the home owner’s property tax
exemption annually applicable according to County Tax Assessor’s records.
Whenever an owner fails to claim such exemption for any calendar year, it shall
be presumed that the properties were rented and therefore, subject to the
business registration, unless the owner establishes to the satisfaction of the
City Clerk that the premises were not rented; provided, however, that the owner
had not advertised or otherwise held out property as being available for lease
or rent during that calendar year.
      (5)   For the leasing or renting of commercial or industrial building(s),
for the leasing or renting of land and for the leasing or renting of office(s),
suite(s) or other business rental(s), a separate business registration
certificate shall be required for each legal parcel upon which the rental unit
(s) are located, or for each building if such building is located on more than
one legal parcel. However, where the ownership of a building is divided as
provided in Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 66426 and 66427 as a condominium or stock
cooperative project then a separate business registration certificate shall be
required for each such division where the owner owns less than four units in
one complex. Where the owner owns four or more such units located in the same
complex, only one business registration certificate shall be required. COMPLEX
shall have the same definition as that in division (G)(4) above.
      (6)   It shall be unlawful for any property owner, landlord, manager or
agent to demand, accept, receive or retain any payment of rent if the unit for
which the rent is paid has not applied for and received a business registration
certificate under this section. Any person violating any of the provisions or
failing to comply with any of the requirements of this section shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor
   (G)   Barbershops, manicurist, shampooing or hairdressing parlors. Every
person, firm or corporation conducting, carrying on or managing a business
consisting principally of a barbershop, manicurist, shampooing or hairdressing

   (H)   Motor vehicle sales - new and used. Every person, firm or corporation
conducting, carrying on or managing a business consisting principally of
selling new and/or used motor vehicles, whether at retail or wholesale,

City Council.

§ 5.04.526 INCREASED COST OF MUNICIPAL SERVICES.
   (A)   The Mayor and City Council do find and determine that in the area
described in division (E) below, there is a concentration of multi-family
residential housing with an excessively high crime rate, including robberies,
shootings, murders, attempted murders, gang activity and drug dealings,
resulting in higher than usual demand for police services and a high
concentration of blight, resulting in a higher than usual need for code
enforcement, parking control and other city services related to blight
reduction.
   (B)   In the area described in division (E) below, it is determined that the
excessive demand of city service is a cost that should not be borne by the
general tax payers of the city, but should be the responsibility of those most
directly involved who are responsible for the conditions which allow such
circumstances to exist and who have the best opportunity to alleviate the
problem.
   (C)   The Mayor and City Council do further find and determine that the
existence of an effective home owner’s association tends to mitigate and reduce
the existence of the types of crime and blight described in division (A) above
due to being closer to the situation and directly involved with the people who
are affected by the adverse effects of crime and blight, and are the recipients
of improvements in such situations, and due to the fact that those who own or
reside in residential property have a greater incentive to care for that
property and to make it a safe environment in which to live.
   (D)   Therefore, in the area described in division (E) below, the business
registration certificate fee imposed on the operation of rental properties,
pursuant to §
5.04.525(F), shall be increased by the amount of $1,000 annually. Provided,
however, if the owner of such rental property joins an areawide homeowners
association approved by the Mayor and City Council, and records conditions,
covenants and restrictions against the property as approved by the City
Attorney, the amount as added by this section shall no longer, such conditions,
covenants and restrictions shall relate to maintenance and landscaping
standards, parking restrictions, security measures and the right of the
homeowners association, or if such association fails to do so, of the city, to
enforce such conditions by means of entry, summary abatement, lien and legal
action.
   (E)   The property to which this section shall apply is described as
follows: those portions of Tract No. 7106 as per plat thereof recorded in Book
90 of Maps, pages 61 and 62, Tract No. 6890 as per plat thereof recorded in
Book 88 of Maps, pages 34 and 35, Shays Subdivision as per plat thereof

§ 5.10.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to implement the provisions of
the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”) to
accommodate the needs of medically-ill persons and provide access to cannabis
for medicinal purposes as recommended by their health care provider(s) and to
provide access to adult use for persons over the age of 21 as authorized by the
Control, Tax and Regulate the Adult Use Cannabis Act (“AUMA” or “Proposition
64” passed by California voters in 2016), while imposing sensible regulations
on the use of land to protect the city’s residents, neighborhoods and
businesses from disproportionate and potentially deleterious negative impacts.
As such, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate the
cultivation, processing, manufacturing, testing, sale, delivery, distribution
and transportation of medicinal and adult use cannabis and cannabis products in
a responsible manner to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents
of the city and to enforce rules and regulations consistent with state law. It
is the further purpose and intent of this chapter to require all commercial
cannabis operators to obtain and renew, annually, a permit to operate within
the city. Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize the possession, use
or provision of cannabis for purposes, or in any manner, that violates state or
federal law. The provisions of this chapter are in addition to any other
permits, licenses and approvals which may be required to conduct business in
the city, and are in addition to any permits, licenses and approval required
under state, city or other law.

§ 5.10.080 MAXIMUM NUMBER AND TYPE OF AUTHORIZED COMMERCIAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES
PERMITTED.
   The number of each type of commercial cannabis business that shall be
permitted to operate in the city shall be established by resolution of the
Mayor and City Council but at no time shall the total number of permits for all
license types exceed one permit per 12,500 residents of the city as determined
by the most recent “Population Estimates for Cities, Counties and the State
Report” generated by the State Department of Finance and Management Services
for the most recent year, unless the Mayor and City Council adopt an ordinance
allowing for a greater number of total permits.
   (A)   This chapter is only intended to create a maximum number of commercial
cannabis businesses that may be issued permits to operate in the city. Nothing
in this chapter creates a mandate that the Mayor and City Council must issue
any or all of the commercial cannabis business permits if it is determined that
the applicants do not meet the standards which are established in the
application requirements or further amendments to the application process or
that the Mayor and City Council, upon further deliberation, determines that the
issuance of any or all commercial cannabis business permits will impact the
public safety, welfare or other policy concerns which may be detrimental in the
issuance of these permits.
   (B)   Each year following the Mayor and City Council’s initial award of
permits, if any, or at any time in the Mayor and City Council’s discretion, the
Mayor and City Council may reassess the number of commercial cannabis business
permits which are authorized for issuance to each business type. The Mayor and
City Council, in its discretion, may determine by resolution that the number of
each type of commercial cannabis permits should be reduced, stay the same or be
expanded.
   (C)   In accordance with the first paragraph of this section, the City
Council has elected to increase the maximum number of cannabis permits that can
be lawfully awarded in accordance with the population formula set forth in this
section as follows: the city may award up to 17 retail business permits. This
maximum number of retail business permits shall include all awarded
microbusiness permits so that there are no more than a total of 17 retail and
microbusiness permits, which include a retail component. The city may award an
unlimited number of cannabis business permits for other types of cannabis
businesses in accordance with the restrictions set forth in this chapter,
applicable guidelines adopted in accordance with this chapter and any zoning
regulations adopted by the City Council.

equivalent quantitative evaluation scale tied to each set of review criteria
(“review criteria”), which shall require any applicable environmental review
pursuant to the Cal. Public Resources Code, Division 13 (commencing with §
21000), as contemplated by Cal. Business and Professions Code, § 26055(h). The
resolution shall authorize the City Manager, or his or her designee(s), to

regulations and processes; solicit applications; conduct initial evaluations of
the applicants; and to ultimately provide a final recommendation to the Mayor
and City Council.

incurred by the city in the application process.

criteria, the City Manager, or his or her designee(s), will make a
recommendation to the Mayor and City Council, and the Mayor and City Council
shall make a final determination in accordance with §
5.10.180.
   (D)   The city’s reservation of rights.
      (1)   The city reserves the right to reject any or all initial
applications. Prior to permit issuance, the city may also modify, postpone or
cancel any request for applications, or the entire program under this chapter,
at any time without liability, obligation or commitment to any party, firm or
organization, to the extent permitted by law. Persons submitting applications
assume the risk that all or any part of the program, or any particular category
of permit potentially authorized under this chapter, may be cancelled at any
time prior to permit issuance. The city further reserves the right to request
and obtain additional information from any candidate submitting an application.
      (2)   In addition to any other justification provided, including a

         (b)   The application did not contain the required elements, exhibits
nor organized in the required format; or

§ 5.10.180 COMMERCIAL CANNABIS BUSINESS PERMITTEE SELECTION PROCESS.
   (A)   The Mayor and City Council shall adopt, by resolution, a procedure
guideline and review criteria by which the top applicants in each category of
each commercial cannabis business will be presented to the Mayor and City
Council for a final determination at a public hearing.
   (B)   The top final applicants for each category may be invited to attend
the Mayor and City Council meeting, only if requested by the City Manager, or
his or her designee, where they may be expected to make a public presentation
introducing their team and providing an overview of their proposal. In order to
provide adequate time, presentations may be divided over more than one meeting
over multiple days as determined to be necessary.
   (C)   At least ten calendar days prior to the hearing, notice of the hearing
shall be sent to all property owners located within 600 feet of the proposed
business locations of each of the finalists to be considered by the Mayor and
City Council.
   (D)   The Mayor and City Council shall either deny or approve the final
candidates and shall select the top candidates in each category of the
commercial cannabis businesses. The Mayor and City Council’s decision as to the
selection of the prevailing candidates shall be final.
   (E)   Official issuance of the commercial cannabis business permit(s),
however, is conditioned upon the prevailing applicant(s) obtaining all required
land use approvals. Following the Mayor and City Council’s selection, the
prevailing applicant(s) shall apply to the City Department of Community
Development and Housing to obtain any required land use approvals or
entitlements for the permittee’s location, if any. Land use approvals shall
include compliance with all applicable provisions of CEQA. The City Manager, or
his or her designee(s), shall formally issue the commercial cannabis business
permit(s) once the Director of Community Development and Housing, or his or her
designee(s), affirms that all of the required land use approvals have been
obtained.
   (F)   Issuance of a commercial cannabis business permit does not create a
land use entitlement or serve as a building permit. The commercial cannabis
business permit shall only be for a term of three years, and shall expire at
the end of the three-year period, unless it is renewed as provided herein.
Furthermore, no permittee may begin operations, notwithstanding the issuance of
a permit, unless all of the state and local laws and regulations, including,
but not limited to, the requirements of this chapter, applicable building
permits and conditions of the commercial cannabis business permit, have been
complied with. Until a state license is available and obtained by the
permittee, this means compliance with all provisions of the Medical Cannabis
Collective Laws as set forth in §
5.10.060.
   (G)   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the Mayor
and City Council reserves the right to reject any or all applications if it
determines it would be in the best interest of the city, taking into account
any health, safety and welfare impacts on the community. Applicants shall have
no right to a commercial cannabis business permit until a permit is actually
issued, and then only for the duration of the permit term. Each applicant
assumes the risk that, at any time prior to the issuance of a permit, the Mayor
and City Council may terminate or delay the program created under this chapter
or otherwise revise, amend or repeal this chapter.
   (H)   If an application is denied, a new application may not be filed for
one year from the date of the denial.
   (I)   Each person granted a commercial cannabis business permit shall be
required to pay the permit fee established by resolution of the Mayor and City
Council to cover the costs of administering the commercial cannabis business
permit program created in this chapter.

location or ownership or management members, the applicant shall file an

transfer ownership or control of the permit to another person unless and until
the transferee obtains an amendment to the permit from the City Manager, or his
or her designee, stating that the transferee is now the permittee. Such an
amendment may be obtained only if the transferee files an application with the
City Manager, or his or her designee, in accordance with all provisions of this
chapter (as though the transferee were applying for an original commercial
cannabis business permit) accompanied by a transfer fee in an amount set by
resolution of the Mayor and City Council (or if not set, shall be the same
amount as the application fee), and the City Manager, or his or her designee,
determines, after hearing, in accordance with this chapter that the transferee
passed the background check required for permittees and meets all other

entity.
      (2)   Although a transfer is not required in these two circumstances, the
permit holder is required to notify the City Manager, in writing, of the change
within ten calendar days of the change. Failure to comply with this provision
is grounds for permit revocation.

permit has been or may be suspended or revoked.

or consent to such illegal operations.
   (B)   The initial rate of the cannabis business tax shall be as follows:
      (1)   (a)   For every person who is engaged in commercial cannabis
cultivation in the city:
            1.   Seven dollars annually per square foot of canopy space in a
facility that uses exclusively artificial lighting;
            2.   Four dollars annually per square foot of canopy space in a
facility that uses a combination of natural and supplemental artificial
lighting;
            3.   Two dollars annually per square foot of canopy space in a
facility that uses no artificial lighting; and
            4.   One dollar annually per square foot of canopy space for any
nursery.
         (b)   For purposes of this division (B), the square feet of canopy
space for a business shall be rebuttably presumed to be the maximum square
footage of canopy allowed by the business’s city permit for commercial cannabis
cultivation, or, in the absence of a city permit, the square footage shall be
the maximum square footage of canopy for commercial cannabis cultivation
allowed by the state license type. Should a city permit be issued to a business
which cultivates only for certain months of the year, the city shall prorate
the tax as to sufficiently reflect the period in which cultivation is occurring
at the business. In no case shall canopy square footage which is authorized by
the city commercial cannabis permit but not utilized for cultivation be
deducted for the purpose of determining the tax for cultivation, unless the Tax
Administrator is informed in writing and authorizes such reduction for the
purpose of relief from the tax prior to the period for which the space will not
be used, that such space will not be used.
      (2)   For every person who engages in the operation of a testing
laboratory: 1% of gross receipts;
      (3)   For every person who engages in the retail sales of cannabis as a
retailer (dispensary) or non-store front retailer (delivery) or microbusiness
(retail sales): 4% of gross receipts;
      (4)   For every person who engages in a cannabis distribution business:
2% of gross receipts; and
      (5)   For every person who engages in a cannabis manufacturing,
processing or microbusiness (non-retail), or any other type of cannabis
business not described in divisions (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3) or (B)(4) above:
2.5% of gross receipts. However, cultivation for a microbusiness shall be taxed
at the rate established in division (B)(1)(a)1. above.
   (C)   The City Council may, by resolution or ordinance, adjust the rate of
the cannabis business tax. However, in no event may the City Council set any
adjusted rate that exceeds the maximum rate calculated pursuant to division (D)
below for the date on which the adjusted rate will commence.
   (D)   The maximum rate shall be calculated as follows.
      (1)   For every person who is engaged in commercial cannabis cultivation
in the city:
         (a)   Through January 1, 2021, the maximum rate shall be:
            1.   Ten dollars annually per square foot of canopy space in a
facility that uses exclusively artificial lighting;
            2.   Seven dollars annually per square foot of canopy space in a
facility that uses a combination of natural and supplemental artificial
lighting;
            3.   Four dollars annually per square foot of canopy space in a
facility that uses no artificial lighting; and
            4.   Two dollars annually per square foot of canopy space for any
nursery.
         (b)   On January 1, 2022 and on each January 1 thereafter, the maximum
annual tax rate per square foot of each type of canopy space shall increase by
the percentage change between January of the calendar year prior to such
increase and January of the calendar year of the increase in the Consumer Price
Index (“CPI”) for all urban consumers in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario
area, as published by the United States Government Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, no CPI adjustment resulting in a decrease of any tax imposed by this
division (D)(1)(b) shall be made.
      (2)   For every person who engages in the operation of a testing
laboratory, the maximum tax rate shall not exceed 2.5% of gross receipts.
      (3)   For every person who engages in the retail sales of cannabis as a
retailer (dispensary) or non-store front retailer (delivery business) or
microbusiness (retail sales activity), the maximum tax rate shall not exceed 6%
of gross receipts.
      (4)   For every person who engages in a cannabis distribution business,
the maximum tax rate shall not exceed 3% of gross receipts.
      (5)   For every person who engages in a cannabis manufacturing,
processing or microbusiness (non-retail activity) or any other type of cannabis
business not described in divisions (D)(1), (D)(2), (D)(3) or (D)(4) above, the
maximum tax rate shall not exceed 4% of gross receipts. However, the maximum
tax rate for cultivation for a microbusiness shall be the rate established in
division (D)(1)(a)1. above, as may be increased, from time to time, by the
provisions of division (D)(1)(b) above.

§ 5.18.060 REPORTING AND REMITTANCE OF TAX.
   (A)   The cannabis business tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid, in
arrears, on a quarterly basis. For commercial cannabis cultivation, the tax due
for each calendar quarter shall be based on the square footage of the
business’s canopy space during the quarter and the rate shall be 25% of the
applicable annual rate. For all other cannabis businesses activities, the tax
due for each calendar quarter shall be based on the gross receipts for the
quarter.
   (B)   Each person owing cannabis business tax for a calendar quarter shall,
no later than the last day of the month following the close of the calendar
quarter, file with the Tax Administrator a statement of the tax owed for that
calendar quarter and the basis for calculating that tax. The Tax Administrator
may require that the statement be submitted on a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator. The tax for each calendar quarter shall be due and payable on
that same date that the statement for the calendar quarter is due.
   (C)   Upon cessation of a cannabis business, tax statements and payments
shall be immediately due for all calendar quarters up to the calendar quarter
during which cessation occurred.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may, at his or her discretion, establish shorter
report and payment periods for any taxpayer as the Tax Administrator deems
necessary to ensure collection of the tax. The Tax Administrator may also
require that a deposit, to be applied against the taxes for a calendar quarter,
be made by a taxpayer at the beginning of that calendar quarter. In no event
shall the deposit required by the Tax Administrator exceed the tax amount he or
she projects will be owed by the taxpayer for the calendar quarter. The Tax
Administrator may require that a taxpayer make payments via a cashier’s check,
money order, wire transfer or similar instrument.
   (E)   For purposes of this section, the square feet of canopy space for a
business shall be rebuttably presumed to be no less than the maximum square
footage of canopy allowed by the business’s city permit for commercial cannabis
cultivation, or, in the absence of a city permit, the square footage shall be
the maximum square footage of canopy for commercial cannabis cultivation
allowed by the state license type. In no case shall canopy square footage which
is authorized by the permit or license but not utilized for cultivation be
excluded from taxation unless the Tax Administrator is informed in writing,
prior to the period for which the space will not be used, that such space will
not be used.

§ 5.18.070 PAYMENTS AND COMMUNICATIONS - TIMELY REMITTANCE.

date shall be the next regular business day on which the city is open to the
public.

§ 5.18.080 PAYMENT - WHEN TAXES DEEMED DELINQUENT.

(Ord. MC-1501, passed 11-6-2018)
§ 5.18.090 NOTICE NOT REQUIRED BY THE CITY.
   The city may, as a courtesy, send a tax notice to the business. However, the
Tax Administrator is not required to send a delinquency or other notice or bill
to any person subject to the provisions of this chapter. Failure to send such
notice or bill shall not affect the validity of any tax or penalty due under
the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. MC-1501, passed 11-6-2018)
§ 5.18.100 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (A)   Any person who fails or refuses to pay any cannabis business tax

cannabis business tax and the payment is subsequently returned unpaid by the
bank for any reason, the taxpayer will be liable for the tax amount due plus
any fees, penalties and interest as provided for in this section, and any other
amount allowed under state law.

the errors attributable to the city, the city shall refund the amount of tax
erroneously paid up to one year from the date that the tax was paid.

cultivation, as defined in the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and

this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed to the city. Any person owing money to
the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action
brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such debt. The provisions
of this section shall not be deemed a limitation upon the right of the city to
bring any other action including criminal, civil and equitable actions, based
upon the failure to pay the tax, penalties and/or fees imposed by this chapter
or the failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. MC-1501, passed 11-6-2018)
§ 5.18.170 APPORTIONMENT.
   If a business subject to the tax is operating both within and outside the
city, it is the intent of the city to apply the cannabis business tax so that
the measure of the tax fairly reflects the proportion of the taxed activity
actually carried on in the city. To the extent federal or state law requires
that any tax due from any taxpayer be apportioned, the taxpayer may indicate
said apportionment on his or her tax return. The Tax Administrator may
promulgate administrative procedures for apportionment as he or she finds
useful or necessary.
(Ord. MC-1501, passed 11-6-2018)
§ 5.18.180 CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY.
   This tax is intended to be applied in a manner consistent with the U.S. and
California Constitutions and state law. None of the tax provided for by this
chapter shall be applied in a manner that causes an undue burden upon
interstate commerce, a violation of the equal protection or due process clauses
of the U.S. or California Constitutions or a violation of any other provision
of the California Constitution or state law. If a person believes that the tax,
as applied to him or her, is impermissible under applicable law, he or she may
request that the Tax Administrator release him or her from the obligation to
pay the impermissible portion of the tax.

power to inspect any location where commercial cannabis cultivation occurs and
to audit and examine all books and records (including, but not limited to,
bookkeeping records, state and federal income tax returns and other records
relating to the gross receipts of the business) of persons engaged in cannabis
businesses. In conducting such investigation, the Tax Administrator shall have
the power to inspect any equipment, such as computers or point of sale
machines, that may contain such records.
   (B)   It shall be the duty of every person liable for the collection and
payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
for a period of at least three years, all records as may be necessary to
determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the
collection of and payment to the city, which records the Tax Administrator, or
his or her designee, shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

business tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may revoke or refuse to renew the license
required by
Chapter 5.04 for any business that is delinquent in the payment of any tax due
pursuant to this chapter or that fails to make a deposit required by the Tax
Administrator pursuant to §
5.18.060.

§ 5.18.210 PAYMENT OF TAX DOES NOT AUTHORIZE UNLAWFUL BUSINESS.
   (A)   The payment of a cannabis business tax required by this chapter, and
its acceptance by the city, shall not entitle any person to carry on any
cannabis business unless the person has complied with all of the requirements
of this code and all other applicable state laws.

authorizing the conduct or continuance of any illegal or unlawful business or
any business in violation of any local or state law.

paid and make a deficiency determination upon the basis of the facts contained
in the statement or upon the basis of any information in his or her possession
or that may come into his or her possession within three years of the date the
tax was originally due and payable. One or more deficiency determinations of
the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made. When a person
discontinues engaging in a business, a deficiency determination may be made at
any time within three years thereafter as to any liability arising from
engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is issued
prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency
determination is made, a notice shall be given to the person concerned in the
same manner as notices of assessment are given under §
5.18.240.

hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing
before him or her no later than 30 calendar days after the receipt of the
application, unless a later date is agreed to by the Tax Administrator and the
person requesting the hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be given by the Tax
Administrator to the person requesting such hearing not later than five

   (A)   Any machine not having the tags required by §
5.44.080 or the information required by §§
5.44.085 and
5.44.025(B) is declared a nuisance, and shall be subject to disconnection by
the city. A representative of the city shall be authorized to disconnect and
render said machine inoperative, following which the machine shall not be
reconnected or returned to operation within the city until the game machine
operator has paid to the Department of Finance and Management Services a
reconnect fee of $25, or such amount as subsequently set by resolution of the
Mayor and City Council, and has paid the business license fee applicable to
each machine under §
5.04.275. No person shall reconnect any machine which has been disconnected or
rendered inoperative by a representative of the city, without prior payment of
the reconnect fee to the city. No operator of the business upon whose premises
the machine is located shall permit such machine to be reconnected without
prior payment of the reconnect fee.
   (B)   The Department of Finance and Management Services shall assess the
person operating a business enterprise within the city upon whose premises one
or more untagged game machines are found for each such untagged game machine,
and for each game machine for which the information required under §§

5.44.025(B) has not been provided, an administrative fee in an amount computed
to cover the average cost of investigating, locating, disconnecting and
controlling untagged game machines and inadequately identified game machines.
This assessment shall be the average cost of such procedures, initially in an
amount of $50, or such amount as subsequently set by resolution of the Mayor
and City Council, for each such untagged game machine, and for each
inadequately identified machine, which administrative fee shall hereafter be
subject to periodic review and determination by the Mayor and City Council,
based upon the experienced costs of such control and regulation. Such
assessment shall be in addition to any reconnection fee imposed under §
5.44.086(A). No such fee shall be assessed as to any such untagged machine when
the business operator has notified the Department of Finance and Management
Services, under the provisions of §
5.44.025(B), in advance of the city’s representative appearing at the scene,
that such untagged machine was located upon the premises. Failure to pay any
assessment within ten days after notice of imposition thereof shall be an
omission justifying suspension of any business licensee’s business license
under the provisions of §
5.04.650. In the alternative, the Department of Finance and Management Services
may notify the person assessed that the business license for those premises
will not be renewed or reissued until all outstanding assessment fees have been
paid.

5.44.086, or any conduct deleterious to the public health, welfare or morals,
and the existence of any of the reasons for a denial of a permit as set forth
in §

such suspension or revocation shall be subject to appeal to the City Manager.
The City Manager shall provide a hearing of such appeal, with notice and
opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and arguments. The formal rules of
evidence shall not apply. The City Manager shall issue a written decision
explaining the basis of his or her decision on the appeal and a copy of the

(Ord. 2100, passed 3-6-1956; Ord. MC-575, passed 1-8-1987)
§ 5.52.020 PERMIT - REQUIRED - APPLICATION.
   It is unlawful for any person to conduct, manage or carry on any escort

for, the operation and conduct of the business. The application shall be upon a
form furnished by the Police Department and shall set forth such information
concerning the applicant and the proposed business as the Chief of Police may
require, and must be accompanied by, a fee in the sum of $200, or such amount
as subsequently set by resolution of the Mayor and City Council. Each permit
issued shall expire on December 31 next following the date of issuance, and
each application for the annual renewal thereof shall be accompanied by a
renewal fee in the sum of $75, or such amount as subsequently set by resolution
of the Mayor and City Council. No permit under this section shall be issued to,
or in the name of, any organization, group, corporation, partnership or any
other entity than an individual person; but the business may be advertised and
carried on by the permittee under a fictitious name in the manner permitted by
law; provided such fictitious name is first approved by the Chief of Police.

   Each application must state the names and addresses of all escorts intended

must notify the Chief of Police in writing, within 24 hours, of any change in
personnel. All such escorts shall be registered by the Police Department and
shall be photographed and fingerprinted. No escort shall be registered unless
there is furnished to the Chief of Police satisfactory evidence of the good
moral character of such escort. The registration of any escort may be canceled
for cause by the Chief of Police and thereafter no escort bureau shall employ,
engage or deal with such escort.
(Ord. 2100, passed 3-6-1956)
§ 5.52.040 PERMIT - GRANTING.
   If the Chief of Police, after investigation, finds that the applicant for
the permit is of good moral character and reputation, and that the business is
to be conducted at a suitable and proper place, and is not calculated or
intended to be operated as a subterfuge for the conduct of any unlawful or
immoral business or practice, then a permit shall be granted. Otherwise, the
application shall be denied.

the new address shall be endorsed upon the permit.

customer; the date and approximate hour of the transaction; the name, address
and telephone number of the patron or customer; the name of each escort
involved; and such other information as the Chief of Police may reasonably
require by rule or regulation. Such record shall be kept available and open to
the inspection of any police officer at any time during business hours and
shall be presented before the Chief of Police at any time upon written request
therefor.
(Ord. 2100, passed 3-6-1956)
§ 5.52.070 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   The Mayor and City Council shall have the power to suspend or revoke any
permit, or to deny a renewal after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
been given to the permittee upon any of the following grounds:
   (A)   That the permittee has, in the course of the business, committed or
caused, permitted, encouraged or condoned the commission of any act in
violation of this section, or any lewd and immoral act, or any act of
prostitution; or
   (B)   That the business has been conducted, in whole or in part, as a
subterfuge to facilitate or to conceal the conduct of any unlawful business or
practice.

solicit, or carry additional passengers therein except with the express consent
of each of said persons; provided, however, that where the Department of
Finance and Management Services finds that public necessity requires the
grouping of passengers in such taxicabs, the Department of Finance and
Management Services may issue a special written permit, which permits shall
specifically set forth the rules and regulations under which such passenger
grouping is permitted. It is unlawful for any driver or carrier to operate or

Management Services. Such vehicles shall, at all times, be kept in a clean and
sanitary condition and in a good state of repair, and shall be subject to
inspection, at all times, by the Department of Finance and Management Services,
or its representative. Any vehicle which becomes unsafe, unclean or

§ 5.76.340 TAXIMETER REQUIRED - INSPECTION - OPERATION.
   (A)   It is unlawful for any carrier to operate, or cause to be operated,
any taxicab in the city unless and until such taxicab is equipped with a
taximeter of a type and design approved by the Department of Finance and
Management Services, and it shall be the duty of the carrier operating such
taxicab, and also the driver thereof, to keep such meter operating at all times
within such standard of accuracy as may be prescribed by the Department of
Finance and Management Services. No passenger shall be carried in any such cab
unless the taximeter is in operation. This provision shall apply regardless of
whether the taxicab is engaged for a trip entirely within the boundaries of the
city or partially outside thereof, and such meter shall be kept operating
continuously during the entire time that it is engaged in the transportation of
passengers for compensation; provided that when the point of destination is
outside the boundaries of the city from a point within the boundaries, the rate
charged for the trip outside of the boundaries may be a flat rate in accordance
with a schedule approved by the Mayor and City Council.
   (B)   The taximeter shall be placed in each taxicab so that the reading dial
showing the amount to be charged shall be well lighted and readily discernible
to a passenger riding in any such taxicab.
   (C)   Every taximeter used in the operation of taxicabs shall be subject to
inspection at any time by the Department of Finance and Management Services, or
any of its representatives. Upon discovery or notice from the Department of
Finance and Management Services of any inaccuracy of such taximeter, the
operator thereof shall remove, or cause to be removed, from service any vehicle
equipped with the taximeter until such taximeter has been repaired and
accurately adjusted or replaced with one approved by the Department of Finance
and Management Services.
   (D)   The carrier shall cause each taximeter to be inspected and tested for
accuracy at least once every six months. Upon the completion of such inspection
and of any adjustments necessary to cause such taximeter to operate within the
standards of accuracy approved by the County Department of Agriculture/Weights
and Measures, the carrier shall cause to be placed upon such meter a gummed
label having printed thereon the following: “This taximeter was inspected and
tested on (date) and found to comply with the standard of accuracy prescribed
by the San Bernardino County Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures.”
The date on which such inspection was made shall be stamped in the blank space
provided for that purpose. No such label shall be removed except at the time a
subsequent inspection is made. The standard of accuracy prescribed by the
Department of Finance and Management Services for each taximeter shall be the
same standard established by the County Department of Agriculture/Weights and
Measures.
   (E)   It is unlawful for any driver of any taxicab, while carrying
passengers, to display the flag attached to the taximeter in such a position as
to denote that such vehicle is not employed, or to fail to throw the flag of
the taximeter to a position indicating the vehicle is unemployed at the
termination of each and every service.
   (F)   All charges for taxicab service shall be calculated and indicated by a
taximeter and at all times while the taxicab is engaged, the flag of the
taximeter shall be thrown into a position to register charges for mileage, or
into a position to register charges for waiting time. No taximeter shall be
used whose mechanism will register a combined charge for mileage and waiting
time in any single position, and no taximeter shall be so operated as to cause
any charge to be registered thereon except during the time while the taxicab is
engaged by a passenger or passengers.
   (G)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to a dial-a-ride
taxicab.

passenger, and also the time consumed while waiting for a passenger after
having responded to a call; but no charge shall be made for the time consumed

timely arrival of any location in response to a call or for time lost through
traffic interruptions or for delays caused by the inefficiency of the taxicab
or its driver.

for a fare as indicated by the taximeter, or for services rendered, to refuse

§ 5.82.010 FINDINGS.
   The city is endeavoring to reduce acts of sexual misconduct, drug
trafficking and “fencing” activities occurring in the city, and to improve the
business environment in the city. In furtherance of these goals, and to promote
the health, safety and welfare of the public, this chapter requires regulatory
permits for the purpose of ensuring that preventive action is taken to curb
criminal activities from occurring on the business premises or from being
involved with the employees or business operations. The criminal activities
interfere with the safe operation of the businesses in the presence of patrons
and visitors, and the continuance of the premises will be detrimental to the
health, safety and welfare of the public. It is further found that such
criminal activities have occurred and are likely to continue to occur on many
business premises in the city.
(Ord. MC-502, passed 3-6-1986)

such business in compliance with all regulations of such business imposed under
or by this chapter, including all conditions imposed by the Chief of Police by
or under §
5.82.070.
   (B)   The commencement, management or conducting of any business regulated
by this chapter without an operator’s permit as required or in a manner that is
not in compliance with all regulations imposed under or by this chapter,
including all conditions imposed by the Chief of Police by or under §
5.82.070, shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter for each and
every day that such business is so commenced, managed or conducted.
   (C)   For the purposes of this chapter, PERSON shall include, but is not
limited to, any individual who commences, manages or conducts a business
regulated by this chapter, whether as principal or agent, clerk or employee,
acting personally or for any other person, or for any corporate entity, or as
an officer of any company, partnership or corporation, or otherwise.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to any person commencing, managing or
conducting any of the following businesses:
      (1)   Hotel; and

      (4)   The location for which the permit is sought is compatible with the
neighborhood and suitable for the type of operation proposed, and will not pose
a public nuisance, as defined in this code, in the neighborhood or disrupt the
peace and solitude of a residential area.

when needed to prevent suffering or impairment of health and, when necessary,
euthanasia, appropriate for the age, species, condition, size and type of the
animal.
   ADEQUATE EXERCISE or EXERCISE. The opportunity for the animal to
sufficiently move to maintain normal muscle tone and mass for the age, species,

quantity and nutritive value to maintain each animal in good health; is
accessible to each animal; is prepared so as to permit ease of consumption for
the age, species, condition, size and type of each animal; is provided in a
clean and sanitary manner; is placed so as to minimize contamination by
excrement and pests; and is provided at suitable intervals for the species, age

species; and for dogs and cats, provides a solid surface, resting platform,
pad, floor mat or similar device that is large enough for the animal to lie on
in a normal manner and can be maintained in a sanitary manner. Under this
title, kennels whose wire grid or slat floors do not protect the animal’s feet
or toes from injury are not ADEQUATE SHELTER.
   ADEQUATE SPACE.

animal is being walked on a leash or is attached by a tether to a lead line.

   ADEQUATE WATER. Provision of, and access to, clean, fresh, potable water of
a drinkable temperature which is provided in a suitable manner, in sufficient
volume and at suitable intervals, but at least once every 12 hours, to maintain

§ 6.02.010 FINDINGS.
   The Mayor and City Council do find, determine and declare that the city has
become so closely built up with buildings occupied by human beings for business
and dwelling purposes, and has become so thickly populated that the keeping
therein of noisy animals has become injurious to health, offensive to the
senses and an obstruction to the free use of property so as to interfere with
the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community and
neighborhood, and by a considerable number of persons therein.
§ 6.02.020 DECLARATION OF A NOISY ANIMAL AS A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   (A)   It is unlawful for any person owning, keeping, harboring or having in
his or her care or custody any dog or other animal to cause or permit to be
made or caused by such dog or other animal, barking or making of any noises or
other sounds, so as to annoy and become offensive to resident(s) in the
vicinity in which the dog or other animal is kept thereby disturbing the peace
of the neighborhood or causing excessive discomfort to any reasonable person(s)
of normal sensitivity residing in the area, unless such noise or sound is made
by an official police dog or fire dog while on duty.
   (B)   If, in violation of the provisions of division (A) above, any dog or
other animal persistently emits any noise or sound in such a manner as to annoy
and become offensive to resident(s) in the vicinity in which the dog or other

and an obstruction to the free use of property so as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community and
neighborhood, and by a considerable number of persons therein.

under the direction of any duly licensed veterinarian, with a rabies vaccine
approved by the State Department of Health Services for use in dogs. Such
vaccinations shall be repeated at intervals specified by the State Department
of Health Services in order to maintain adequate immunity. Compliance with the

of a dog license.
   (B)   Each duly licensed veterinarian who vaccinates or causes or directs to
be vaccinated any animal with a rabies vaccine shall complete and sign a rabies
certificate in triplicate. The veterinarian shall keep one copy and shall give

§ 6.08.120 EXEMPTION FROM RABIES VACCINATION DURING ILLNESS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, a dog need not be
vaccinated for rabies during an illness if a licensed veterinarian has examined
the dog and certified in writing that such vaccination should be postponed
because of a specified illness or condition. Old age, debility and pregnancy
are not considered contraindications to rabies vaccination. Exemption
certificates are subject to approval of the Animal Control Division and shall
be valid only for the duration of the illness. Exemption from vaccination does
not exempt the dog from the licensing requirement.

§ 6.08.130 RUNNING AT LARGE - IMPOUNDMENT.
   The animal control officer, or authorized city employee, shall impound, for

unrestrained in the city. If any person does not provide proof of the owner’s
identity or satisfactory proof of ownership and claim the dog and pay any sums
due, including outstanding fines or fees for violations of this title, license
fees or fees set by the Mayor and City Council, prior to the expiration of the
period prescribed by state law, the dog shall become the property of the city
and may be disposed of by authorized employees of the city.
(Ord. 821, passed 8-9-1921; Ord. 3452, passed 10-30-1974; Ord. MC-50, passed 5-

§ 6.08.140 RUNNING AT LARGE.
   (A)   Persons owning, having control or custody of any dog or other animal
shall, at all times, keep the animal on a leash (except in an authorized off-
leash dog park) or secured by the other suitable means of restraint or confined
by a fence on their property or the private property of another, with the
permission of the owner of that property, so as to prevent the animal from
being at large, biting or harassing any person engaged in a lawful act,
interfering with the use of public property or with the use of another person’s
private property or being in violation of any other section of this title.
   (B)   The provisions of division (A) above shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   Any dog used by a law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Any dog while participating in a formal dog obedience training
program or any dog participating in a dog show or other program expressly
permitted or sponsored by the city; and
      (3)   Any dog within a posted off-leash area in any city park, as
established by resolution of the Mayor and City Council; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall relieve the owner or person having charge, custody,
care and/or control of such dog from the responsibility to maintain proper
control over the dog nor shall this division (B)(3) be construed as relieving
such person from any liability for any damages arising out of his or her use of
an off-leash area.
   (C)   In order to be subject to the exemption set forth in division (B)(3)
above, all persons must comply with all requirements of law and the following
rules and regulations when utilizing any off-leash area.
      (1)   No dog is permitted in an off-leash area except when in the care,
custody and control of a person at least 13 years old. Any person under 13
years of age must be accompanied by, and be under the direct supervision of, an
adult. No person may have more than two dogs in an off-leash area at any one
time. No dogs are permitted in the off-leash area except during posted hours of
operation.
      (2)   All dogs must be at least four months of age, vaccinated for rabies
and currently licensed by the City Animal Control Division. No dog that is
sick, in heat, injured or less than four months of age, or which displays
aggressive behavior towards other dogs or humans is permitted in any off-leash
area.
      (3)   Any person having care, custody or control of a dog in an off-leash
area shall quiet or remove the dog if it barks and shall promptly remove and
properly dispose of any waste deposited by such dog.
      (4)   No animals other than dogs are permitted in any off-leash area.
      (5)   The designated hours of use for the off-leash area shall coincide
with the regular hours of the park as designated by §
12.68.020.
      (6)   As a condition of admission to an off-leash area, the owner or

the removal and disposal of dog feces.
      (7)   Any person having care, custody or control of a dog in the off-
leash area must have, in his or her possession, a leash for such dog which
shall be worn by the dog at all times the dog is not in the off-leash area.
      (8)   All persons will otherwise comply with all rules governing city
parks and all relevant parking regulations.
      (9)   The use of an off-leash area by any dog shall constitute consent of
the dog’s owner, or any person having the care, custody or control of the dog,
to strictly follow the rules in §
6.08.140 and shall constitute a waiver of liability to the city, its elected
officials, officers and employees; an assumption of all risks; and an agreement
and undertaking to protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, its
elected officials, officers and employees, for any injury or damage to persons
or property during any time that the dog is in the off-leash area.
   (D)   Any person violating any provisions of this section, including, but
not limited to, violation of any rules applicable to use of off-leash areas,
shall be guilty of an infraction, punishable as set forth in
Chapter 1.12.
   (E)   The violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall
constitute a nuisance and may be abated by the city through civil process by

manner provided by law for the abatement of such nuisances.
(Ord. MC-1214, passed 2-22-2006)
§ 6.08.145 METHODS OF RESTRAINT - IMPROPER RESTRAINT.
   (A)   Any person walking a dog on a leash on public property, including
sidewalks, and the private property of others, must keep the dog on a leash and
under physical control being able to restrain the movement of the dog with the
leash at all times. The leash must be kept in good condition, of sufficient
strength to prevent breaking under pressure and of material generally resistant
to chewing or gnawing by an animal. The leash must be of a length to control
the dog from harassing pedestrians or other animals at all times.
   (B)   (1)   Fencing must be adequate in terms of size to the number of dog
(s) contained in the fenced area to prevent the dog(s) from escaping, of
recognized construction methods and in compliance with all other sections of
the municipal code. Gates must be properly secured by a latching or locking
mechanism and the height and condition of the fence must be able to prevent the
dog(s) from escaping.
      (2)   A fence should be at least two and one-half times the height of the
dog’s shoulder when the dog is standing on four legs and be in compliance with
all other sections of the municipal code. However, should a dog be able to
escape from a fenced yard, either by climbing, jumping or digging, additional
fencing height, kennels or other restraint methods may be required in addition
to fencing. Fencing must be maintained in continued good condition. Existing
fencing regardless of height will be considered an acceptable means of
restraint unless and until a written complaint is filed with the Division of
Animal Control and evaluated, or if fencing allows dogs to reach over and
harass people on adjacent private property or people on the public right-of-
way.
   (C)   Invisible fencing may be used as an alternative to traditional fencing
as long as the system is installed by an authorized dealer of such products and
set up and maintained in the following manner:
      (1)   The owner and handler of the dog receive training regarding the use
and maintenance of said system;
      (2)   The owner or handler must post signs visible from the public
streets or driveways sufficient to alert the general public upon approaching
the property where the fencing is located; and
      (3)   Two signs are required stating that the “Dog is confined by
electronic device;” the name, address and telephone number of the company; any
trademark and/or logo of either the company that installed the system or the
company that maintains the system. Signs shall be at least six inches by eight
inches and be displayed in a prominent and visible location.
   (D)   Dog kennels must be tall enough to prevent the dog(s) from jumping
over, or have a secure top, and must be able to prevent dog(s) from digging
out. Kennels must have a minimum of 100 square feet for one dog, plus an
additional 25 square feet for each additional dog in the same enclosure.
   (E)   Cable runs are authorized as an alternative to fencing or kennel runs.
Cable runs must allow the animal freedom of motion to move about at will within
a protected area on the property without becoming tangled in obstacles. The
cable runs shall be located in the yard area so as to prevent the dog from
traversing upon another person’s property, public sidewalks or public property,
and from charging and harassing persons and pedestrians utilizing these
properties. Cables must be sized according to the manufacturer’s specifications
for the weight of the animal.
   (F)   Tie-outs must be of sufficient length to allow the animal freedom of
movement without becoming tangled, but never less than eight feet in length,
excluding the length of the collar. Tie-outs must be made of a non-rigid
material. Tie-outs shall not be the primary means of restraint and no animal
shall be kept in this manner for more than three hours a day.
   (G)   It is unlawful to use a weighted chain collar as a method of
restraint.
   (H)   No person shall use a dog as a weapon or to threaten or harass other
person(s) or animal(s), or keep a dog in such a manner wherein the dog charges
a fence, leaps up and reaches across the fence in an assaultive manner to a
pedestrian on public property or a neighbor legally on private property.
   (I)   If a dog is found running at large by the city animal control, the
incident shall constitute prima facie evidence that current restraint methods
are inadequate, and the owner shall be required to correct any conditions that
permitted the dog to run at large, and provide such additional restraints as
are necessary to secure and maintain the future restraint of the dog.

§ 6.08.150 VACCINATION OF OTHER ANIMALS.
   (A)   The same vaccination procedure and exemption shall apply to other
animals if the Director of Animal Control or designated officer shall deem this
prudent to ensure the safety of the public based on the recommendations of the
State Department of Health Services.
   (B)   Animals shall be vaccinated against rabies with a vaccine currently
licensed for use in such animal(s) in the United States and approved for use in
such animal by the State Department of Health Services.

report such bite to the Animal Control Division immediately.
   (B)   An owner or custodian of any dog or cat which is known to have been
bitten by or having contact with a rabid animal or by an animal suspected of
having rabies shall immediately notify the Animal Control Division.

§ 6.08.170 CONFINEMENT OR DESTRUCTION OF DOGS AND CATS SUSPECTED OF HAVING
RABIES.
   (A)   Any dog or cat found within the city reasonably suspected of having
rabies, having contact with a rabid or suspected rabid animal or exhibiting the
common symptoms of such disease shall be taken into custody immediately by the
animal control officer and confined in the city animal shelter or at a private
veterinarian establishment approved by the Director. The animal shall be kept
in solitary confinement for such time as recommended by the State Department of
Health Services to determine whether the animal is afflicted with rabies.
   (B)   At the time any such animal is impounded, an attempt shall be made to
discover whether the animal has been vaccinated previously against rabies. If
it is found that such animal has not been vaccinated effectively, then such
animal shall be vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian after the last day of the
observation period described in division (A) above, unless the animal is
humanely destroyed pursuant to division (C) below.
   (C)   The animal control officer may cause to be humanely destroyed any dog
or cat which, in the opinion of a veterinarian or animal health technician, has
rabies, or is in need of confinement pursuant to division (A) above, but such
confinement is impossible or impractical. In such circumstance, the animal
control officer shall arrange to have the head of such dog or cat examined for
the purpose of confirming rabies. If the opinion of a veterinarian or animal
health technician is not reasonably obtainable, the officer may act on his or
her own opinion.
   (D)   All expenses incurred with the enforcement of the provisions of this
section shall be borne by the owner or custodian of the dog or cat.
(Ord. MC-833, passed 5-19-1992)
§ 6.08.180 CONFINEMENT OR DESTRUCTION OF DOGS AND CATS WHICH HAVE BITTEN A
PERSON.
   (A)   Every dog or cat which has bitten a person, or is suspected of having
bitten a person, shall be quarantined away from other animals for a period of
ten days from the date of the bite, or other period of time as determined by
the State Department of Health Services. The animal control officer may order
the animal quarantined at the shelter, at a private veterinarian clinic or at
the home of the owner, depending on the conditions of the bite, the severity of
the bite, previous bite history, the owner’s ability to satisfy quarantine
orders and whether or not local ordinances were in observance at the time of
the bite.
   (B)   If the animal does not have a current rabies vaccination, it shall not
be vaccinated until the end of the quarantine period.
   (C)   The animal control officer may cause to be humanely destroyed any dog
or cat when, in the opinion of a veterinarian or animal health technician, such
confinement as described in division (A) above is impossible or impractical. In
such cases, the animal control officer shall arrange to have the head of such
dog or cat examined for rabies. If the opinion of a veterinarian or animal
health technician is not reasonably obtainable, the officer may act on his or
her own opinion.
   (D)   All expenses incurred with the enforcement of the provisions of this
section shall be borne by the owner or custodian of the dog or cat.
(Ord. MC-833, passed 5-19-1992)
§ 6.08.190 CONFINEMENT OR DESTRUCTION OF OTHER ANIMALS.
   Any animal, other than a dog or cat, which has bitten a person, has had
contact with a rabid or suspected rabid animal, is reasonably suspected of
having rabies or exhibiting the common symptoms of rabies shall be confined for
quarantine purposes or destroyed in accordance with the recommendations of the
State Department of Health Services or the local health officer.
(Ord. MC-833, passed 5-19-1992)
§ 6.08.200 CONCEALMENT OR WITHHOLDING OF ANIMALS.

animal or that has bitten a person to prevent it from being confined or
destroyed in accordance with this chapter.
(Ord. MC-833, passed 5-19-1992)
§ 6.08.210 ANIMALS AND VEHICLES.
   (A)   No person shall transport or carry, on any public highway or public
roadway, any dog(s) or other animal(s) in a motor vehicle, unless the animal is
safely enclosed within the vehicle or protected by a cap or container, cage or
other device that is adequately ventilated and that will prevent the dog(s) or
other animal(s) from falling from, being thrown from or jumping from the motor
vehicle.
   (B)   No person shall leave a dog or any other animal in an unattended
vehicle without adequate ventilation, or in such a manner as to subject the
animal to extreme temperatures which adversely affect the animal’s health or
welfare.
§ 6.08.220 ANIMAL BITE.

6.09.090 or
6.09.100.
(Ord. MC-1264, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 6.09.030 HEARING ON DECLARATION OF DOG AS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS OR VICIOUS.
   If an animal control officer or a law enforcement officer determines that
probable cause exists to believe a dog is potentially dangerous or vicious, the
officer or his or her immediate supervisor may file a petition with the hearing
officer for a hearing, as provided in §
6.14.080, to determine whether or not the dog in question should be declared
potentially dangerous or vicious. Whenever possible, any complaint received
from a member of the public shall be sworn to and verified by the complainant
and attached to the petition. The Animal Control Division shall notify the
owner or keeper of the dog that a hearing will be held and that the owner or
keeper may present evidence at the hearing. The Animal Control Division shall
serve upon the owner or keeper of the dog the notice of the hearing and a copy
of the petition either personally or by first class mail with return receipt
requested. The hearing shall be open to the public and held not less than five
working days, nor more than 14 working days, after service of the notice upon
the owner or keeper of the dog. The hearing officer may admit all relevant
evidence, including incident reports and affidavits of witnesses, limit the
scope of discovery and may shorten the time to produce records or witnesses.
The hearing officer may decide all issues even if the owner or keeper fails to
appear at the hearing. The hearing officer may find, upon a preponderance of
the evidence, that the dog is potentially dangerous or vicious and make other
orders authorized by this chapter.
§ 6.09.040 DETERMINATION AND ORDERS; NOTICE; COMPLIANCE.
   After the hearing conducted pursuant to §
6.09.030, the owner or keeper of the dog shall be notified, either personally

6.09.140 within ten days after the date of the order or as specified by the
hearing officer.
§ 6.09.050 HEARING OFFICER’S DECISION FINAL - NOTICE.
   The written decision of the hearing officer shall be final, subject to the
right to judicial review of any aggrieved party pursuant to Cal. Food and
Agriculture Code, § 31622. The city shall cause notice of the hearing officer’s
decision to be served upon the owner of the dog either personally or by first
class mail, postage prepaid, forthwith upon issuance.
(Ord. MC-1470, passed 3-7-2018)
§ 6.09.060 SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT PENDING HEARING.
   If the animal control officer or law enforcement officer determines that
probable cause exists to believe the dog in question poses an immediate threat
to public safety, or if the animal was previously declared potentially
dangerous or vicious and the owner is found to be in violation of the hearing
order or of any provisions of this chapter and probable cause exists to believe
the dog poses an immediate threat, he or she may seize and impound the dog
pending the hearings held pursuant to this chapter. If the dog is later
adjudicated potentially dangerous or vicious or if the owner is found to be in
violation of this chapter, the owner or keeper of the dog will be liable for
costs and expenses of impounding the dog. If the animal control officer
determines that the impoundment is not contrary to public safety, he or she
shall permit the animal to be confined in a city approved kennel or veterinary
facility at the owner’s expense.
(Ord. MC-1214, passed 2-22-2006)
§ 6.09.070 CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH DOGS MAY NOT BE DECLARED POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS OR VICIOUS.
   (A)   The hearing officer may not declare a dog potentially dangerous or
vicious if the dog inflicted injury or damage to a person committing a willful
trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the
dog, or was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog, or was
committing or attempting to commit a crime.
   (B)   The dog may not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if it was
protecting or defending a person within the dog’s immediate vicinity from an
unjustified attack or assault.
   (C)   A dog may not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if the
injury or damage was sustained by a domestic animal that was teasing,
tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog.
   (D)   A dog may not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if the
injury or damage to a domestic animal was sustained while the dog was working
as a hunting dog, herding dog or predator control dog on the property of or
under the control of its owner or keeper, and the damage or injury was to a
type of domestic animal appropriate to the dog’s work.
§ 6.09.080 POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DESIGNATION MAINTAINED IN REGISTRATION
RECORDS.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 6.08 regarding licensing and
vaccination, all potentially dangerous dogs shall be properly licensed and
vaccinated. A dog determined to be potentially dangerous will be so designated
in its registration records. The city may charge a potentially dangerous dog or
vicious dog fee in addition to the regular licensing fee to provide for the
increased costs of maintaining the records of the dog. Any fees regarding this
section shall be set by resolution of the Mayor and City Council.
(Ord. MC-1470, passed 3-7-2018)
§ 6.09.090 MUZZLING AND VACCINATION.
   The hearing officer may, by order, require the muzzling of any dog owned or
harbored within the city that is found to be potentially dangerous or vicious,
and may specify the period of time during which such dog shall be so muzzled.
Any dogs running at large which are not vaccinated, or which are not muzzled,
pursuant to such order, shall be forthwith put to death by authorized employees
of the city. Such muzzling must not cause injury to the dog or interfere with
the animal’s vision, respiration or its ability to drink.
§ 6.09.100 KEEPING AND CONTROLLING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DOGS.
   The owner or keeper of a potentially dangerous dog must keep the dog indoors
or in a securely fenced enclosure from which the dog cannot escape and into
which children cannot trespass. A potentially dangerous dog may be off the
owner or keeper’s premises only if it is restrained by a substantial leash, not
to exceed six feet in length, and if it is under the direct physical control of
a responsible adult.
§ 6.09.110 DEATH, SALE, TRANSFER OR PERMANENT REMOVAL; NOTICE.
   The owner or keeper of a potentially dangerous dog must notify the Animal
Control Division if the potentially dangerous dog dies, is sold, transferred or
permanently removed from the city.
§ 6.09.120 POSTING PROPERTY.
   The hearing officer may order that the owner of a potentially dangerous or
vicious dog conspicuously post the property with warning signs where the
potentially dangerous or vicious dog is housed.
§ 6.09.130 REMOVAL FROM LIST OF POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DOGS.
   Upon receipt of a petition from the dog owner, the hearing officer may
remove a dog from the list of potentially dangerous dogs if no additional
instances of behavior described in this chapter occur within a 36-month period
from the date of designation as a potentially dangerous dog.
§ 6.09.140 KEEPING AND CONTROLLING VICIOUS DOGS.
   The owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall maintain the dog pursuant to the
conditions imposed by §
6.01.060 and the provisions of this chapter.
§ 6.09.150 DESTRUCTION; NON-DESTRUCTION, CONDITIONS; ENCLOSURES.
   A vicious dog may be destroyed if the hearing officer determines that the
release of the dog would create a significant threat to the public health,
safety and welfare. If the hearing officer determines that the vicious dog
should not be destroyed, the hearing officer must impose conditions upon the
dog’s owner or keeper that will protect the public health, safety and welfare.
If one of the conditions is to require that the vicious dog be confined in an
enclosure, the enclosure must be designed in order to prevent the animal from

   (A)   The Mayor and City Council find that there is a need for an
alternative method of enforcement for certain violations of Title 6 and
applicable state codes. The Mayor and City Council further find that an
appropriate alternative method of enforcement for animal control violations is

criminal, civil or any other legal remedy established by law, which may be
pursued to address violations of Title 6 or applicable state codes.

with Title 6. Such compliance is a matter of local concern and serves an
important public purpose.

the city;

§ 8.02.010 ADOPTION OF THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY CODE.
   (A)   The city adopts by reference, and makes a part of this chapter, San
Bernardino County Code, Chapter 14 of Division 3 of Title 3, entitled
“Inspection Grading of Food Establishments” (attached and incorporated herein
as Exhibit A), with the following exceptions (shown with additions underlined
and deletions lined-out):
      (1)   Section 33.1403, “Grading,” division (c) is amended to read as
follows:
(c)   Any food establishment that fails to attain at least a “B” grade, as
defined herein, shall be issued written notice, through an OIR, by the health
official. The food establishment must correct the deficiencies listed in the
OIR and must file a written request for a re-score inspection with the health
official within 30 days of the OIR. A re-score inspection shall be conducted by
the health official and be subject to a re-score inspection fee as provided in
the Code, Schedule of Fees. The health official will complete the re-score
inspection within ten (10) County business days of food establishment’s filing
of a written request for a re-score inspection. A food establishment failing to
comply with the OIR, or failing to attain at least a “B” grade on the re-score
inspection, may be immediately closed by the health official pursuant to State
law and remain closed until at least a “B” grade is achieved on a re-score
inspection. Nothing in this provision shall prohibit the health official from
immediately closing any food establishment if, at his discretion, immediate
closure is necessary to protect the public health pursuant to State law.
      (2)   Section 33.1404, “Notice of Closure,” is amended to read as
follows:
“Notice of Closure” means a public notice that shall be posted by the health
official at a food establishment upon suspension or revocation of the food
establishment’s public health permit and that results in the closure of the
food establishment and the discontinuance of all operations of the food
establishment, by order of the health official, because of violations of
applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the
protection of public health. The Notice of Closure shall remain posted until
removed by the health official. Removal of the Notice of Closure by any person
other than the health official or the refusal of a food establishment to close
upon issuance of the written notice of suspension of the public health permit
is a violation of this Chapter and may result in the revocation of the food
establishment’s public health permit and shall be prosecuted by the City
Attorney and be punishable as a misdemeanor as specified in section 33.0112 of
this Code
Chapter 1.12 of the San Bernardino Municipal Code.
      (3)   Section 33.1406, “Posting Requirements - Penalty for Non-Compliance
- Documents Available for Public Review,” division (c) is amended to read as
follows:
(c)   The Letter Grade Card shall not be defaced, marred, camouflaged, hidden
or removed. It shall be unlawful to operate a food establishment unless the
Letter Grade Card is posted. Removal of the Letter Grade Card or any other
signs posted by the health official, is a violation of this Chapter and may
result in the suspension or revocation of the public health permit and shall be
prosecuted by the City Attorney and be punishable as an infraction or a
misdemeanor as specified in section 33.0112 of this Code
Chapter 1.12 of the San Bernardino Municipal Code.
   (B)   The aforementioned sections of the San Bernardino County Code, as
amended herein, are adopted as the inspection grading of food establishments
program for the city.

adopted herein, and as which may be modified in the future by the county, is
adopted as the fees in effect in the city, and shall be applicable within the

administer and collect these fees for deposit with the County Treasurer to
offset the costs assumed by the county in administering this program.

§ 8.18.065 COUNCIL ACTION.
   (A)   If the property owner does not pay the cost of abating the nuisance
within 30 calendar days after the cost becomes final or the hearing officer
confirms the costs of abatement, the cost shall become a special assessment
against the real property upon which the nuisance was abated. The assessment
shall continue until it is paid, together with interest at the legal maximum
rate computed from the date of confirmation of the statement until payment. The
assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary
municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and
the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary
municipal taxes.
   (B)   The Director shall notify the property owner in writing of the
property owner’s right to be publicly heard by City Council prior to City
Council adopting a resolution assessing such unpaid costs of abatement as liens
upon the respective parcels of land. The notice shall include the date, time
and location of the public hearing.
   (C)   The City Council shall adopt a resolution at a public hearing
assessing such unpaid costs of abatement as liens upon the respective parcels
of land as they are shown upon the last available assessment roll.

   (A)   The City Clerk shall prepare and file with the County Auditor a
certified copy of the resolution of the City Council assessing the costs of
abatement as a lien on the land, adopted pursuant to §
8.18.065.
   (B)   Notice of lien shall be mailed by certified mail to the property
owner, if the property owner’s identity can be determined from the County
Assessor’s or County Recorder’s records. The notice shall be given at the time
of imposing the assessment and shall specify that the property may be sold
after three years by the Tax Collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The
Tax Collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the
property owner to receive notice.
   (C)   The County Auditor shall enter each assessment on the county tax roll
upon the parcel of land. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and
in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be
subject to the same penalties and procedure and sale in case of delinquency as
is provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the
special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of
abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for
value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and
attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes
would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien
against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured
roll for collection. The tax collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by
the failure of the property owner to receive notice.
(Ord. MC-1449, passed 11-1-2017)
§ 8.18.067 RECORD OF NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN.
   As an additional remedy, the Director may cause a nuisance abatement lien

of Cal. Gov’t Code, § 38773.1.
(Ord. MC-1449, passed 11-1-2017)
§ 8.18.068 COLLECTION OF COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES PRIOR TO HEARING.

filing of a certified copy of the City Council resolution assessing the
abatement costs with the County Auditor.

§ 8.18.070 INVENTORY OF SALVAGEABLE MATTER.
   (A)   When any of the matter referred to in §
8.18.010 or other materials have been removed from the yard, lot or premises
pursuant to the abatement procedures set forth in §§
8.18.050 and
8.18.060 and have been determined by the Director to be salvageable, the matter
and materials shall be inventoried and held and retained by the Director for a
period of at least 30 days after written notice that the matter and materials
are being held at a specified place for delivery to the owner thereof and a
copy of the inventory has been served, by certified mail, to the last address
of record, postage prepaid, or by personal delivery, upon the owner.
   (B)   In the event the owner does not take possession of and remove at his
or her own expense the matter and materials from the place where stored by the
Director within 30 days after the service upon him or her, the city shall have
a lien against the matter and materials for storage charges for the 30-day
period, and the matter and materials shall thereafter be appropriated for the
use of the city or disposed of or sold at public auction as follows.
      (1)   Notice of such sale describing the matter and material in
sufficient detail for its identification shall be published once by the
Director at least five days before the time fixed for the sale in a regularly
published newspaper of general circulation in the city.
      (2)   The matter and materials offered for sale shall be sold to the
highest bidder for cash; provided that the Director may, at his or her
discretion, fix a minimum sale price and may refuse to sell unless the minimum
price is offered.
      (3)   Proceeds of the auction sale or sales shall be applied towards the
cost of abatement of the nuisance and the remainder, if any, shall be deposited
with the Department of Finance and Management Services, to be placed in the
General Fund thereof; provided that in the event the costs of conducting the
auction sale or sales and the storage charges, combined with the costs of
abatement, are less than the proceeds, then the balance or difference between
the costs and the total proceeds shall be refunded to the owner.

owner or occupant of the lot or premises to abate the same, and if the nuisance
is not abated within 48 hours after service or posting of notice and no appeal
to the Fire Chief or Director is pending, then the Fire Chief or Director shall

be abated, and the expense of such clearing shall be a lien on the lot.
   (B)   The notice given shall state that the finding of an urgent nuisance
may be appealed to the City Clerk within 48 hours of receipt. If abatement is
ordered upon appeal to the Fire Chief or Director, the abatement shall be

hours. The notice required under this section shall be in writing and shall be
delivered to the owner at the address appearing in records of a title company
or as may be known, except if the owner cannot be located after a reasonable,
good faith effort, then notice may be delivered to the occupant of the premises
or conspicuously posted on such lot or premises. If the owner does not reside
within the city, the notice of nuisance may be sent by special delivery mail,
and shall be effective 24 hours after mailing. Actual notice by telephone,
supplemented by mailing, shall be effective as of the time of the telephoned
notice.
   (D)   The procedures to be followed with respect to the assessment of the
expenses of abatement shall be the same as those set forth in §
8.18.060 and
Chapter 8.30.
   (E)   URGENT PUBLIC NUISANCE, as employed in this section, means a condition
of property which is a menace to public health or safety or constitutes a fire
hazard under conditions which would be judicially determined to be a nuisance
per se or a nuisance in fact, or where the destruction or removal of the

within the city and to users outside the city who are, by permit, contract or
agreement with the city, users of the city’s solid waste collection services or
are conducting business or activities within the city which fall under the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. MC-1431, passed 11-10-2016)
§ 8.24.040 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Provision of solid waste services.
      (1)   Solid waste related activities within the city shall be performed
under the direction of the City Manager, and for such purposes, the city may
use city personnel, enter into contract agreements with private hauling firms
or approve franchise agreements to perform such activities. Solid waste
enterprises operating pursuant to such a contract or franchise agreement shall
meet the terms, rates, standards and services specified in the contract or
franchise agreement. However, the City Manager may authorize any person to
collect, remove and disperse garbage, recyclable materials and organic waste
under such terms, conditions and limitations deemed necessary in the interests
of the public health, safety and welfare.
      (2)   No person, solid waste enterprise or the agents, servants or
employees thereof shall provide solid waste collection services within the city
without approval, which shall be issued only on a vote of the City Council. All
recycling, organic waste and garbage collections shall be made as quietly as
possible, and the City Manager may fix and determine the hours for collection.
      (3)   Except as expressly called out in the franchise agreement, the
franchised hauler is granted the exclusive franchise, duty, right and privilege
to collect, transfer, transport, recycle, process and dispose of garbage,
organic waste and recyclable materials generated within the boundaries of city
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the franchise agreement.
   (B)   Subscription required. The property owner or tenant of each occupied
premises shall have at least the minimum level of solid waste collection
service made available to that premises by the franchised hauler, as specified
in the franchise agreement between the city and the franchised hauler. At its
discretion, the city may require a higher level of solid waste collection
service if the current level of service is deemed insufficient. The charges for
solid waste collection service rendered or made available shall be paid for all
periods of time during which the premises are occupied, regardless of whether
or not the owner or tenant has any solid waste to be collected on any
particular collection date during such occupancy. Nothing in this chapter is
intended to prevent an arrangement, or the continuance of an arrangement, under
which payments for solid waste collection service are made by a tenant or
tenants, or any agent or other person, on behalf of the owner. However, any
such arrangement will not affect the property owner’s obligation to pay for
solid waste collection service as provided herein.
   (C)   Commencement of solid waste collection service. The property owner or
tenant shall commence solid waste collection service within seven days after
occupancy of a premises, or portion thereof. In the event service is not
initiated within such period of time, the City Manager may give written notice
to the owner or tenant that solid waste collection service is required. If
service is not initiated by the property owner or tenant within seven days
after the date of mailing the notice, the City Manager shall authorize the
franchised hauler to begin and continue providing the minimum level of solid
waste collection service to such premises and the service shall be deemed to
have been made available as of the date of such authorization.
   (D)   Charge for solid waste collection service. Any and all charges for
solid waste collection service shall be set forth in the franchise agreement,
contract or the collection service agreement between the city and its
franchised hauler.
   (E)   Special services. Customers requiring special services shall contact
the franchised hauler to arrange for such service. Charges for such special
services shall be set forth in the franchise agreement.
   (F)   Exemption from service. Any customer may make an application for
exemption from solid waste collection services on the basis that a developed
property is unoccupied, and that no garbage, organic waste or recyclable
materials shall be placed or offered for collection by the city or its
authorized franchised hauler from such property. The City Manager may
temporarily exempt such property from participation in the city’s solid waste
collection program for the limited period while the property is unoccupied;
provided that any such statement or representation shall be made in affidavit
form, fully sworn to by the person making such statement or representation and
filed with the City Manager. An exemption shall be valid only for the time that
the statements made in the affidavit continue to be true. Any violation of
provisions of the exemption shall result in termination of the exemption and
shall require the customer to subscribe to the solid waste collection services
in accordance with this chapter.
   (G)   City Manager may restrict self-haul. Nothing in this chapter is
intended to prevent residents, that subscribe and pay for solid waste
collection services with the franchised hauler, from self-hauling garbage,
recyclable materials or organic waste to permitted solid waste facilities, and
other solid wastes (excluding garbage, recyclable materials and organic waste)
in excess of their normal subscription level to facilities that accept and
responsibly process those materials, as may be necessary from time to time.
However, the City Manager may restrict or prohibit self-hauling by individual
generators if the City Manager determines, after providing notice and an
opportunity for a hearing, that the generator’s self-hauling activities violate
the provisions of this chapter or any other applicable law or regulation.
   (H)   Organics prohibited from use as alternative daily cover. Pursuant to
the provisions of 2014 Assembly Bill 1594 (AB 1594, which amended the Cal.
Public Resources Code, §§ 40507 and 41781.3), the franchised hauler, and any
generators who self-haul organic waste, may not direct their organic waste for
use as ADC. If the City Manager determines that the franchised hauler or any
other generator has directed any organic waste for use as ADC, the City Manager
will notify the franchised hauler or generator of the requirements of this
provision. Repeated instances of directing organic waste for use as ADC may
result in enforcement action as per §
8.24.130.
(Ord. MC-1431, passed 11-10-2016)
§ 8.24.050 FAILURE TO PAY.
   (A)   Failure to pay for solid waste collection service. The franchised
hauler shall be entitled to payment from the property owner, tenant or any
other subscribing person on behalf of the property owner for any services
rendered or to be rendered. Solid waste collection service shall not be
discontinued for residential customers by reason of any failure to pay the
charges for such service. The franchised hauler may temporarily suspend
services if a commercial customer has been delinquent in payment for a period
of at least 45 days in accordance with the terms of the franchise agreement.
   (B)   Notification of delinquency.
      (1)   Customers (owners or tenants) who have not remitted required
payment within 45 days after the date of billing shall be notified by the
franchised hauler on forms that contain a statement that if payment is not
received within 15 days from the date of the notice, the delinquent and unpaid
charges, including a 10% penalty and 1.5% monthly interest, may be placed on
the county annual secured property tax rolls and that any amount owing would

§ 8.24.110 CONTAINERS.
   (A)   Containers - franchise required. The franchised hauler is the
exclusive provider of containers for the collection of C&D, garbage, recyclable
materials, organic waste and large items. This includes any and all containers
placed in the public right-of-way, on city property, private property or
elsewhere in the service area, for collection of C&D, garbage, recyclable
materials, organic waste and large items and subsequent delivery to a permitted
solid waste facility. Collection utilizing containers may be on a temporary or
permanent basis, in accordance with the terms of the franchise agreement
between the city and the franchised hauler. Any containers left on the public
right-of-way, public property or private property by a company or person
without a contract or franchise agreement with the city to provide such
services shall be deemed illegal and subject to removal pursuant to these
provisions.
   (B)   Notice to remove.
      (1)   Upon determination that a container is illegal, the owner of the
container will be called and notified of such violation, if it is marked, and
the owner will be given 24 hours to remove the container. A “notice to remove
container” shall be posted on the container and mailed to the owner, if the
owner’s address is known or easily ascertainable. If the container is unmarked
and the owner is unknown, a 24-hour posting of the notice to remove the illegal
container shall be deemed sufficient notice.
      (2)   The notice shall be in substantially the following form:
“NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN pursuant to Chapter
8.24.110 of the San Bernardino Municipal Code that the City Manager, or his or
her designee, has determined that this container was placed in the City of San
Bernardino without the necessary contract or franchise agreement and is hereby
deemed illegal and that the removal of the container is required. This
container must be removed from the City of San Bernardino within twenty-four
(24) hours of the date and time of this Notice. Failure to remove this
container will result in the seizure of the bin by the City of San Bernardino
or the franchised hauler. A hearing may be requested within fifteen (15) days
of the seizure to reclaim the container. If no hearing is requested within
fifteen (15) days, the container will become the property of the City of San
Bernardino. The owner may waive a hearing by paying the costs for removal,
storage, and disposal, if any, of the container. The total amount of costs to
be paid may be obtained from the City.”
   (C)   Notice to remove - exemptions. The city may waive the 24-hour notice
to remove a container in the event that the owner of the illegally placed
containers can be identified and the city possesses documentation of at least
two prior instances of issuing notices to remove and subsequent removal of
containers owned by the same owner in the prior 12 months.
   (D)   Cost of removal of containers. The cost of removal of an illegally
placed container, including all costs for removal, storage and disposal of the
container and its contents, will be set by the city via resolution. Payment of
those costs will be the responsibility of the owner of the illegally placed
container.
   (E)   Removal hearing and appeal process.
      (1)   Any illegal container that has been removed by the city or
franchised hauler shall be stored pending a hearing before the City Manager.
Said hearing must be requested within 15 days and scheduled within 30 days
following the removal of the container.
      (2)   The owner of the container may waive the hearing and pay the city’s
costs for removal, storage and disposal of the container and claim the
container. The amount of costs will be determined by the City Manager.
      (3)   If the container is not claimed and no hearing is requested within
15 days of removal of the container, the container will become the property of
the city and the city may dispose of or use the container as the city may deem
appropriate.
      (4)   If a hearing is timely requested, the City Manager shall determine
whether the owner of the container had a contract or franchise agreement with
the city. If the City Manager determines that the owner of the container did
not have the requisite contract or franchise agreement with the city, the City
Manager may order the container returned to the owner after payment of the
costs for removal, storage and disposal of the container. If the City Manager
determines that the owner did have the requisite contract or franchise
agreement with the city, the container shall be returned to the owner at no
cost to the owner.
      (5)   The owner of a container that is the subject of a timely hearing
may appeal the City Manager’s decision to the hearing officer within ten days
of the City Manager’s decision. The hearing officer’s decision shall be final.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may obtain review
of such decision by filing an appeal with the Superior Court of the State of
California, County of San Bernardino, in accordance with the time lines and
provisions set forth in Cal. Gov’t Code, § 53069.4 and Cal. Code of Civil
Procedure, §§ 1094.5 and 1094.6.

solid waste to collect or accumulate for more than one week, or cause or permit

employee will post a notice of violation (“NOV”) requiring the property owner
or occupant to bring the property into compliance. If the occupant does not
respond to or comply with the notice of violation, the city will take the
necessary steps to bring the property into compliance, including, if necessary,
cleaning and sanitizing the container area. The occupant shall be held
responsible for all fees and costs incurred as a result of the city bringing
the property into compliance.

reasonably accumulate upon such property in the reasonable and lawful use
thereof.
   (D)   Contamination of recyclable materials and organic waste. No person
shall place in any container identified for recyclable materials or organic
waste any material that would inhibit its recyclability or compostability.
Containers set aside for recyclable materials or organic waste shall be used

rendering such organic waste unfit for the consumption of animals or production
of soil amendments or compost shall be mixed therewith.

administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. The City Manager, or
anyone designated by the City Manager to be an enforcement officer, may
exercise such enforcement powers. If the City Manager determines that a solid
waste generator is in violation of this chapter or of any rule or regulation
adopted pursuant to this chapter, the City Manager may begin enforcement
proceedings. Public nuisance proceedings and/or code enforcement proceedings

are incorporated in its entirety and shall govern the imposition, enforcement,
collection and review of administrative citations or orders issued to enforce
this chapter and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this chapter;
provided, however, that the City Manager may adopt regulations providing for
lesser penalty amounts. The City Manager has the authority to impose
administrative penalties for the notices of violations.

administrative account that is available to fund activities to implement the
applicable provisions of this chapter. Any remedy provided under this chapter
is cumulative to any other remedy provided in equity or at law. Nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to limit the right of the city or its authorized
collection agent(s) to bring a civil action; nor shall a conviction for such

§ 8.30.021 SUMMARY/EMERGENCY ABATEMENT.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter with reference to the
abatement of public nuisance, the Code Enforcement Director, Fire Chief, Chief
of Police, City Engineer, Director of Public Works, Building Official or their
designees shall have the authority to immediately cause the abatement of any
public nuisance if it is determined that the nuisance presents an immediate
threat to public health or safety, or an imminent hazard to real or personal
property, in their sole discretion. Any such abatement activity may be
conducted without observance of any notice requirements described in this
chapter. The city is entitled to recover all abatement costs incurred in the
abatement of an imminent threat or hazard as set forth in this chapter.

§ 8.30.022 SUMMARY/EMERGENCY ABATEMENT POST-ABATEMENT HEARING.
   (A)   Within ten business days, or as soon as reasonably possible under the
circumstances, following any summary abatement action by the city to abate an
immediate threat to public health or safety, or imminent hazard to real or
personal property, the city must provide the owner and any other responsible
person with a “notice of summary abatement.”
   (B)   The notice of summary abatement shall be served in accordance with §
8.30.023 and contain the following information:
      (1)   A brief description of the condition and reasons why it constituted
an imminent threat or hazard;
      (2)   A brief description of the law prohibiting or pertaining to the
imminent threat or hazard;
      (3)   A brief description of the actions the city took to abate the
imminent threat or hazard; and
      (4)   An itemized invoice identifying all nuisance abatement costs
related to the summary abatement. The invoice shall further indicate that any
unpaid amounts may become a lien and special assessment against the property.
   (C)   The city’s determination that a public nuisance constituted an
imminent threat or hazard may be appealed as set forth in §
8.30.030. The invoice of abatement costs may be appealed as set forth in §
8.30.045. Any party to whom an invoice has been issued shall have 45 calendar
days from the date of the invoice to remit full payment of the invoice to the
city. If the owner or other responsible person fails to make timely, full
payment of the abatement costs within 45 days of issuance of the notice of
summary abatement or as ordered by the hearing officer after any appeal, the
city may then proceed to collect its abatement costs in any manner allowed by
law, including as set forth in §
8.30.055.
   (D)   Omission of any of the foregoing provisions in a notice of summary
abatement, whether in whole or in part, or the failure of an owner or
responsible person to receive this document, does not render it defective or
render any proceeding or action pursuant to this chapter invalid.
   (E)   The decision of the hearing officer on the determination of nuisance
is final. Any appeal of the hearing officer’s decision shall be governed by
Cal. Code of Civil Procedure, § 1094.6 or such section as may be amended from
time to time.

Simultaneously, the same notice may be sent by regular mail addressed to the

regular mail is not returned;
      (3)   By posting in a conspicuous place on the premises or abutting
public right-of way; or
      (4)   In the alternative, insertion of a legal advertisement at least
once a week for the period of two weeks in a newspaper of general circulation

         (c)   The right to appeal.
      (2)   The notice shall direct the abatement of the nuisance and refer to

         (c)   The amount of nuisance abatement costs disputed; and
         (d)   The specific legal and factual grounds for all disputes of the
invoice and nuisance abatement costs.
   (B)   The failure of any party to properly and timely request a hearing is a
waiver of the right to contest the invoice, a waiver of the right to a hearing,
a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and a bar to any further challenge
to the city’s invoice and nuisance abatement costs.
   (C)   If a hearing is timely and properly requested, the City Clerk shall
cause a hearing to be set before the hearing officer. The city shall provide
notice of the date, time and location of the hearing to all parties at least
ten calendar days before the hearing. At the time fixed for the hearing, the
hearing officer shall hold an informal hearing to consider the invoice and
protests or objections raised by the requestor.

hearing officer shall issue a decision approving, denying or modifying the
amount of the nuisance abatement costs that the city is entitled to recover.

served by mail. The decision of the hearing officer on the abatement costs
shall be final. If any cost recovery is upheld, even in part, the city shall be
the prevailing party. If cost recovery is entirely denied, the requesting
parties shall be the prevailing parties.
   (F)   Any appeal of the hearing officer’s decision shall be governed by Cal.
Code of Civil Procedure, § 1094.6, or such section as may be amended from time
to time
(Ord. MC-1418, passed 10-5-2015; Ord. MC-1521, passed 9-18-2019)
§ 8.30.050 COUNCIL ACTION.
   (A)   If the property owner does not pay the cost of abating the nuisance
within 30 calendar days after the cost becomes final or the hearing officer
confirms the costs of abatement, the cost shall become a special assessment
against the real property upon which the nuisance was abated. The assessment
shall continue until it is paid, together with interest at the legal maximum
rate computed from the date of confirmation of the statement until payment. The
assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary
municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and
the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary
municipal taxes.
   (B)   The City Council shall adopt a resolution assessing such unpaid costs
of abatement as liens upon the respective parcels of land as they are shown
upon the last available assessment roll.
(Ord. MC-1418, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 8.30.055 IMPOSITION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT LIEN AND NOTICE.
   (A)   The City Clerk shall prepare and file with the County Auditor a
certified copy of the resolution of the City Council assessing the costs of
abatement as a lien on the land, adopted pursuant to the preceding section.
   (B)   Notice of lien shall be mailed by certified mail to the property
owner, if the property owner’s identity can be determined from the County
Assessor’s or County Recorder’s records. The notice shall be given at the time
of imposing the assessment and shall specify that the property may be sold
after three it years by the Tax Collector for unpaid delinquent assessments.
The Tax Collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the
property owner to receive notice.
   (C)   The County Auditor shall enter each assessment on the county tax roll
upon the parcel of land. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and
in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be
subject to the same penalties and procedure and sale in case of delinquency as
is provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the
special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of
abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for
value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and
attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes
would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien
against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured
roll for collection. The tax collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by
the failure of the property owner to receive notice.
(Ord. MC-1418, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 8.30.056 RECORDING OF NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN.
   As an additional remedy, the Code Enforcement Director may cause a nuisance
abatement lien for costs related to abatements, other than dangerous building
abatements, to be recorded with the County Recorder’s office, pursuant to the
provisions of Cal. Gov’t Code, § 38773.1.
(Ord. MC-1418, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 8.30.060 COLLECTION OF COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES PRIOR TO HEARING.

filing of a certified copy of the City Council resolution assessing the
abatements costs with the County Auditor.
(Ord. MC-1418, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 8.30.065 ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
   The procedures established in this chapter shall be in addition to criminal,
civil or other legal or equitable remedies established by law which may be
pursued to address violations of this code or applicable state codes and the
use of this chapter shall be at the sole discretion of the city.
(Ord. MC-1418, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 8.30.070 VIOLATION - PENALTY.
   (A)   The owner or other person having charge or control of any such
buildings or premises who maintains any public nuisance defined in this chapter
or who violates an order of abatement made pursuant to §
8.30.030 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (B)   Any occupant or lessee in possession of any building or structure
contrary to an order given as provided in this chapter is guilty of a

of the city or with any representative of a city department or with any person
who owns or holds any estate or interest in a building which has been ordered
to be vacated, repaired, rehabilitated or demolished and removed, or with any
person to whom any such building has been lawfully sold pursuant to the
provisions of this code whenever any such representative of the City Council,
representative of the city, purchaser or person having any interest or estate
in the building is engaged in vacating, repairing, rehabilitating or
demolishing and removing any such building pursuant to the provisions of this

§ 8.36.010 FINDINGS.
   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the
authority granted by the state under the Cal. Vehicle Code, §§ 22660 through
22664 to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts
thereof as public nuisances, the Mayor and City Council make the following
findings and declarations: the accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public
property, not including highways, is found to create a condition tending to
reduce the value of private property; to promote blight and deterioration; to
invite plundering; to create fire hazards; to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors; to create a harborage for
rodents and insects; and to be injurious to the health, safety and general
welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or part thereof on private or public property, not
including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is a public
nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2969, passed 1-21-1969; Ord. 3685, passed 11-9-1977)

action as the hearing officer deems appropriate under the circumstances to
carry out the purpose of this chapter. The hearing officer may delay the time

as hereinafter provided, and may determine the administrative costs and the
cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the parcel of land on which
the vehicle or part thereof is located. The order requiring removal shall

costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon
which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from
such landowner.
   (C)   The decision of the hearing officer in an appeal under
Chapter 9.94 is final.

§ 8.39.010 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Mayor and City Council has determined that persons who operate vehicles
and use them to illegally deposit, discard, dump and/or place garbage, rubbish,
recyclable discards and/or green waste; bring decay; and cause nuisances to
local neighborhoods where they so deposit, discard, dump and/or place such
matter. The Mayor and City Council has further determined that seizing the
vehicles of persons who so illegally deposit, discard, dump and/or place such
garbage, rubbish, recyclable discards and/or green waste in the city will deter
said nuisances from occurring if their vehicles are subject to seizure and
forfeiture. The Mayor and City Council finds that there is a need to provide
for the abatement of such nuisance vehicles.
§ 8.39.020 NUISANCE VEHICLES.
   (A)   Any vehicle used to illegally deposit, discard, dump and/or place
garbage, rubbish, recyclable discards or green waste in violation of §
8.24.070(C) is declared a nuisance vehicle, and the vehicle shall be subject to
seizure and forfeiture as provided in this chapter. GARBAGE, RUBBISH,
RECYCLABLE DISCARDS and GREEN WASTE shall be defined as set forth in §
8.24.060. Any person, whether as principal or agent, clerk or employee, either
for himself or herself or any other person, or for any body corporate, or as an
officer or agent for a corporation, or otherwise, who owns, leases, possesses,
conducts, uses or maintains any vehicle (hereinafter referred to as “vehicle”),
used for any of the purposes or acts set forth in this section, is guilty of a
nuisance.
   (B)   In the event that any provision of this chapter, or any part thereof,
or any application thereof to any person or circumstance, is, for any reason,
held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or ineffective by a court of
competent jurisdiction on its face or as applied, such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining provisions of this chapter, or any part thereof,
or any application thereof to any person or circumstance or of said provision
as applied to any other person or circumstance. It is declared to be the
legislative intent of the city that this chapter would have been adopted had
such unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective provision not been included
herein.
(Ord. MC-1235, passed 10-3-2006)
§ 8.39.030 RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST IN VEHICLE.
   All right, title and interest in any vehicle described in §
8.39.020 shall vest in the city upon commission of the act giving rise to the
nuisance under this chapter.
§ 8.39.040 PROCESS.
   (A)   Vehicles subject to forfeiture under this chapter may be seized by any
peace officer upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the
vehicle.
   (B)   (1)   Under this chapter, seizure without process may be made if any
of the following situations exist:
         (a)   The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search pursuant to a
search warrant; or
         (b)   There is probable cause to believe that the vehicle was used in
violation of this chapter.
      (2)   All seized vehicles shall be towed pursuant to this section.
§ 8.39.050 RECEIPTS.
   Receipts for vehicles seized pursuant to this chapter shall be delivered to
any person arrested out of whose possession such vehicle was seized, in
accordance with Cal. Penal Code, § 1412.
§ 8.39.060 EVIDENCE.
   Property seized pursuant to §
8.39.040, where appropriate, may be held for evidence. The City Attorney shall
institute and maintain the proceedings pursuant to §
8.39.070.
§ 8.39.070 FORFEITURE.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (H) below or §
8.39.100, if the City Attorney determines that the factual circumstances
warrant that the vehicle described in §
8.39.020 is subject for forfeiture, the City Attorney shall file a petition for
forfeiture with the Superior Court of the county.
   (B)   A petition for forfeiture under this section shall be filed as soon as
practicable, but in any case within six months of the seizure of the vehicle
which is subject to forfeiture.
   (C)   Within 30 days from the seizure, the City Attorney shall cause a
notice of the seizure and of the intended forfeiture proceedings, as well as
notice stating that any interested party may file a verified claim with the
Superior Court in the county, to be served by personal delivery or by
registered mail upon any person who has an interest in the vehicle. Whenever a
notice is delivered pursuant to this section, it shall be accompanied by a
claim form as described in §
8.39.090 and directions for the filing and service of a claim. Notice shall
also be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
      (2)   The City Attorney shall provide notice of the proceedings under
this section, including the following information:
         (a)   A description of the vehicle;
         (b)   The date and place of seizure;

property; and
         (d)   The instruction for filing and serving a claim with the City
Attorney pursuant to §
8.39.090 and time limits for filing a claim.
   (D)   An investigation shall be made by the City Police Department as to any
claimant to the vehicle whose right, title, interest or lien is of record in
the Department of Motor Vehicles or appropriate federal agency. If the City
Police Department finds that any person, other than the registered owner, is
the legal owner thereof, and such ownership did not arise subsequent to the
date and time of arrest or notification of the forfeiture proceedings or
seizure of the vehicle, it shall immediately send a notice to the legal owner
at his or her address appearing on the records of the Department of Motor
Vehicles or appropriate federal agency.
   (E)   All notices shall set forth the time within which a claim of interest
in the vehicle seized or subject to forfeiture is required to be filed pursuant
to §
8.39.090.
   (F)   With respect to a vehicle described in §
8.39.020 for which forfeiture is sought and as to which forfeiture is
contested, the city shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the vehicle was used as set forth in §
8.39.020. Trial shall be before the court or by jury. The presiding judge of
the Superior Court shall assign the action brought pursuant to this chapter for
trial.
   (G)   Upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was
used for any of the purposes set forth in §
8.39.020, the court shall declare the vehicle a nuisance and order that the
vehicle be seized, if not previously seized and held by the Police Department,
forfeited and sold and the proceeds distributed in accordance with this
chapter.
   (H)   If no claims are filed, the City Attorney shall prepare a written
declaration of forfeiture of the vehicle to the court and dispose of the
vehicle in accordance with this chapter. A written declaration of forfeiture
signed by the City Attorney under this section shall be deemed to provide good
and sufficient title to the forfeited vehicle. The City Attorney shall provide
a copy of the declaration of forfeiture to any person who received notice of
the forfeiture proceedings.
   (I)   If a claim is timely filed, then the City Attorney shall file a
petition for forfeiture pursuant to this section within 30 days of the receipt
of the claim.
§ 8.39.080 INNOCENT PARTIES; RETURN OF VEHICLE.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the City Police Department
shall return a seized vehicle upon the filing of a timely claim pursuant to §
8.39.090 and upon a showing by the claimant that:
   (A)   The vehicle is owned by two or more persons and there is a community
property interest in the vehicle by a person other than the person who used or
maintained the vehicle to illegally deposit, discard, dump and/or place
garbage, rubbish, recyclable discards and/or green waste, and the vehicle is
the sole vehicle available to the person’s immediate family;
   (B)   The vehicle is owned by the employer of the person who used or
maintained the vehicle for illegally depositing, discarding, dumping and/or
placing garbage, rubbish, recyclable discards and/or green waste, and the
employer files and serves on the City Attorney a declaration or affidavit under
penalty of perjury that he or she had no knowledge of said illegal activity; or
   (C)   The vehicle is owned by a rental car agency with a duly executed
contract with the person who used or maintained the vehicle for illegally
depositing, discarding, dumping and/or placing said garbage, rubbish,
recyclable discards and/or green waste.
§ 8.39.090 INTEREST CLAIM.
   Any person claiming an interest in a vehicle seized pursuant to §
8.39.020 must, at any time within ten days from the date of the notice of
seizure, file with the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San
Bernardino, San Bernardino District, a claim, verified in accordance with the

vehicle. An endorsed copy of the claim shall be served by the claimant on the

   (B)   The hearing shall be before the court or by jury.
   (C)   The provisions of the California Code of Civil Procedure shall apply
to proceedings under this chapter unless otherwise inconsistent with the
provisions or procedures set forth in this chapter. However, in proceedings
under this chapter, there shall be no joinder of actions; coordination of
actions, except for forfeiture proceedings; or cross-complaints, and the issues
shall be limited strictly to the questions related to this chapter.
§ 8.39.100 ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Any person, or his or her servant, agent or employee, who owns,
leases, conducts, uses or maintains any vehicle for illegally depositing,
discarding, dumping and/or placing garbage, rubbish, recyclable discards and/or
green waste, and whose vehicle has been seized in accordance with this chapter
may request to execute a voluntary settlement agreement with the city for the
return of the vehicle. However, nothing in this section shall require the city
to follow these alternative settlement procedures.
   (B)   Such request shall be made in writing to the City Attorney. The
minimum amount of the settlement agreement shall be sufficient to cover all of
the city’s reasonable administrative costs, including attorneys’ fees and
personnel time for the seizure and forfeiture action. The costs, salary and
expenses of the City Attorney and members of the City Attorney’s office in
enforcing this chapter on behalf of the city shall be considered as “attorneys’
fees” for the purposes of this section. The executed settlement agreement shall
be accompanied by the appropriate settlement fee amount in the form of a money
order, cash or cashier’s check. All settlement funds shall be distributed as
set forth in §
8.39.110(B) and (C).
§ 8.39.110 SALE OF VEHICLES.
   In all cases where a vehicle seized pursuant to this chapter is forfeited to
the city, the vehicle shall be sold by the Police Department, its agent or
designee, and the proceeds of the sale shall be distributed and appropriated as
follows:
   (A)   To the bona fide or innocent purchaser, conditional vendor, mortgagee
or lien holder of the vehicle, if any, up to the amount of his or her interest
in the vehicle, when the court or City Attorney declaring the forfeiture and
sale of the vehicle orders a distribution to that person;

with the publication of the notices set forth in this chapter, and sale of the

transportation of any vehicle seized under this chapter;
   (C)   The remaining funds shall be placed in the General Fund of the city,
subject to appropriate accounting controls and financial audits for all
deposits and expenditures; and
   (D)   All the funds placed in the General Fund, pursuant to this chapter,

made available to support the law enforcement and prosecutorial efforts of the
Police Department or the City Attorney’s office.
§ 8.39.120 NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.
   This chapter is not the exclusive regulation or penalty for the illegal
depositing, discarding, dumping and/or placing of garbage, rubbish, recyclable
discards and/or green waste. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent
the City Attorney from commencing a civil action to abate a nuisance in
addition to, alternatively to or in conjunction with the proceeding set forth
in this chapter, nor shall anything in this chapter be deemed to prevent the
city from commencing a criminal action with respect to the nuisance in addition
to, alternatively to or in conjunction with the proceedings set forth in this
chapter, or other ordinance, statute or state law.
§ 8.39.130 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter is determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction, or by any federal or state agency having jurisdiction over its
subject matter, to be invalid and in conflict with any paramount federal or
state law or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is determined by that
court or agency to require modification in order to conform to the requirements
of that paramount law or regulation, then that provision will be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent part of this chapter, and such determination
will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provisions. If
that paramount federal or state law or regulation is subsequently repealed or
amended so that the provision of this chapter determined to be invalid or
subject to modification is no longer in conflict with that law or regulation,
then that provision will again become effective and will thereafter be binding.

   (A)   In order to supplement state legislation and to control the spread of
infectious venereal disease in the city, pursuant to Cal. Health and Safety
Code, § 3194, certain arrested persons reasonably believed to be infected with
an infectious venereal disease and certain other persons not arrested but
reasonably believed to be so infected may be ordered to report to the County
Department of Public Health or to a physician and undergo examination and
testing for infectious venereal disease, and to provide evidence to the city of
having had such examination and testing.
   (B)   When, in the judgment of an authorized individual, it is necessary to
protect the public health, a person in either of the following categories may
be reasonably believed to have an infectious venereal disease:
      (1)   (a)   Any person who is arrested for an offense in the nature of
solicitation or prostitution of the type punishable under Cal. Penal Code, §
647:
            1.   For solicitation in prostitution related cases; or
            2.   For prostitution.
         (b)   Any person who is convicted of any such offense.
      (2)   Any person who, within the past 12 months, has had any such
infectious venereal disease, or has been convicted of any offense of the kind
herein specified within 12 months past and who fails to present satisfactory
evidence of examination and testing for infectious venereal disease, and who is
reasonably believed to be engaged in any activity in the nature of prostitution
or solicitation.
   (C)   A person in the foregoing categories who is reasonably believed to
have an infectious venereal disease may be ordered in writing by the County
Director of the Department of Public Health (hereinafter referred to as “health
officer”), his or her authorized deputy or any city employee designated by the
Mayor and approved by the health officer, to report to either his or her own
physician, the County Department of Public Health or an authorized physician
retained by the city, if any, at that person’s option, and to be examined and
tested for the purpose of determining whether such person is, in fact, infected
with an infectious venereal disease. Each such person shall submit to such
examination and testing as are necessary and are authorized by law and shall
permit specimens to be taken for laboratory analysis. The provisions hereof are
for health purposes and shall not be utilized as, or construed to be, a penalty
or punishment.
   (D)   If any such person is found to have an infectious venereal disease of
a type which is amenable to treatment, he or she shall be referred for such
treatment as is consented to or is otherwise authorized by law. If such disease
is not amenable to treatment, such person shall be referred for counseling
under rules of the health officer.
   (E)   Examination and testing shall occur not later than ten days after the
arrest, service of an order to be examined for infectious venereal disease or
release from custody, whichever last occurs. Within ten days after such
examination and testing, each person ordered to be examined for infectious
venereal disease shall obtain a medical report setting forth the results of
examination and testing for infectious venereal disease and shall deliver or
transmit the report to the health officer and, additionally, shall provide
evidence of having had such examination and testing to the city or county
issuing the order, which evidence shall not be publicly disclosed pursuant to

applicants shall be reviewed for compliance with this chapter. All qualified
applicants who held a license during 2002, whether as an individual or as part
of a joint venture, shall have priority for the available licenses in 2003.
Priority will also be given in 2003 to any joint venture which has at least one

qualified applicants which were part of such joint venture(s) shall lose their
priority and shall be placed in a lottery drawing for any remaining available
licenses after all other qualified applicants from the immediate previous year

licensees or co-licensees from the immediate previous year does not exceed 35
licenses, then any remaining licenses shall be determined by lottery and shall
be granted by a drawing supervised by the Director of Finance and Management

licenses, and to suspend the priority of the licensee, for any such violation
found to have occurred during or immediately preceding or immediately following
the authorized period of sale.
   (B)   The decision of the Fire Chief, or his or her designee, or the Police
Chief, or his or her designee, to suspend the license of any licensee shall be
subject to review by the City Manager. In view of the limited sales period each
year, for suspensions affecting the sale period, such hearing shall be held at
the earliest possible time that the licensee, the City Manager, or his or her
designee, and the representative of the Fire Chief or Police Chief can schedule
such hearing; provided that in every case, said hearing shall be held within 72
hours of the Fire Chief’s or Police Chief’s decision. For suspensions after the
sale period, the hearing shall be held within one month after the request for
hearing, which request must be made within 15 days after notice of the
suspension. The City Manager is authorized to set aside the suspension, or to
modify the suspension by limiting its effect to only one or more days, or by

§ 8.60.095 REGULATORY FEE FOR LICENSEE AND FIREWORKS SUPPLIER.
   (A)   The city shall assess a regulatory fee based on the gross sales of
fireworks on all fireworks sales that occur within the city. One-half of the
regulatory fee shall be paid by the licensee and the remaining one-half shall
be paid by the fireworks supplier. The purpose of the regulatory fee is to
raise sufficient funds for the city to pay for fireworks public education and
an awareness campaign about fireworks, and for enforcing the provisions of this
chapter, including extra personnel time for fire inspection and enforcement
duties.
   (B)   Prior to imposing the fee, the city shall prepare a study of the
anticipated cost for fireworks education, awareness and enforcement. After
preparing the study, the Mayor and City Council shall adopt a resolution
setting the regulatory fee rate no later than 7:00 p.m. on July 1 of each year.

8.60.070(P). After the Department of Finance and Management Services receives

total annual regulatory fee. Payment of the regulatory fee by each licensee and
each fireworks supplier shall be due to the city 30 days following the issuance
of the invoice.
   (D)   Failure by any licensee or fireworks supplier to pay the amount
invoiced by the City Department of Finance and Management Services shall be
cause to disqualify the licensee from obtaining a license to sell fireworks and
disqualify the fireworks supplier from providing its products for sale in the
city in the future. In the event that the regulatory fee is not paid by the due
date, it shall be subject to a 10% penalty for each month or portion of a month
that it is overdue. If not paid by the due date, the amount becomes a debt owed
to the city subject to collection by any legal means available.
   (E)   Any person who violates or causes violation of any provision of this
section shall be deemed guilty of an infraction or a misdemeanor, which, upon
conviction thereof, is punishable in accordance with the provisions of §

other than signs authorized under this code, on public or private property,
including on buildings, walls, fences, curbs and other structures, in a place
visible to the public, from a public street, alley or other place open to the

of the city.
   (B)   Whenever any of the public nuisances mentioned in division (A) above
exist in the city, the Director of Public Services, or his or her designee, may
find and declare the same to be a public nuisance under the provisions of this
chapter and may order the abatement of such public nuisance as hereinafter
provided. Special priority shall be given to the abatement of any writings or
symbols which are offensive to a substantial number or class of citizens, or

cause a breach of the peace.
   (C)   Any owner whose property is found to be or contain a public nuisance
by the Director of Public Services shall have the right to request a hearing to
determine whether in fact a public nuisance exists as hereinafter provided. The
owner may specifically consent to removal, in which event the Director of
Public Services is authorized to immediately abate the nuisance.
(Ord. MC-370, passed 5-22-1984)
§ 8.69.040 NOTICE TO REMOVE GRAFFITI; PROTESTS AND NOTICE OF HEARING THEREON.
   (A)   When the Director of Public Services finds a nuisance, as described in
§
8.69.030, to exist, he or she shall cause a “notice to remove graffiti” to be
given in regard to all property on which, or abutting that property on which,
the nuisance exists. A notice shall be mailed to each property owner as his,
her or its name and address appears in the current records of a title company
or the tax assessment rolls of the county, or as may be otherwise known. The
notice shall contain a date, a description of the property by street
designation and any other information deemed appropriate by the Director of
Public Services to designate the location from which graffiti, writings or
other inscriptions are to be removed. The notice shall be in substantially the
following form:
“NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN pursuant to Section
8.69.040 of the San Bernardino Municipal Code that the Director of Public
Services of the City of San Bernardino has determined that a nuisance exists on
or abutting the property described in this Notice, or on the parkway thereof.
The nuisance consists of graffiti, writings or other inscriptions, on
buildings, walls, fences, curbs or other structures on such property or
abutting such property. You must abate or remove this nuisance, by removal or
covering of such graffiti, writings or other inscriptions. If you do not remove
such nuisance, the nuisance may be removed and abated by the City of San
Bernardino, without further notice to you, and for that purpose officers,
agents, employees or contractors working under the direction of the Director of
Public Services may enter upon your property to abate such nuisance.
Any person objecting to this determination of a nuisance or the proposed
removal and abatement of said nuisance shall file a written protest with the
City Clerk not later than five days from the date of mailing of this Notice.
The City Clerk shall transmit such protest promptly to the Director of Public
Services, who shall promptly schedule a date, time and place for hearing, and
shall give notice thereof to the protesting property owner or other protester.
The Director of Public Services will personally, or by an official hearing
officer designated by him or her, hear any protests and consider any
information, evidence or argument concerning the existence of such alleged
nuisance, and after having given to the property owner, or his or her
representative, the reasonable opportunity to be heard, shall render a decision
as to whether a nuisance exists. If a timely protest has been filed, you or
your agent may appear at said hearing and be heard and may present and hear
evidence concerning the existence of the alleged nuisance and the proposed
abatement.
If you desire to have the City remove such nuisance, you may notify the
Director of Public Services that you consent to abatement of the nuisance by
the City.”
   (B)   In addition to mailing the notice in the manner and form required
herein, such notice may (permissive) be conspicuously posted on or adjacent to
the property from which the nuisance is to be abated.
(Ord. MC-370, passed 5-22-1984)
§ 8.69.050 HEARING BY DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SERVICES - APPEAL TO MAYOR AND CITY
COUNCIL.
   (A)   At the time set for hearing, the Director of Public Services, or his
or her designee, shall hear and consider all objections or protests to the
finding of nuisance and proposed abatement of the nuisance, and may continue
the hearing from time to time. The hearing officer shall consider, among other
things, whether the expense necessarily incurred in complying with the
ordinance and the sanctions imposed for non-compliance are reasonable in
relation to the health, safety and public welfare interest being protected;
whether the existence of graffiti, writings or other inscriptions in its
present location is in fact a public nuisance, and has the effect of
diminishing property values of the neighborhood and contributes to community
blight; and shall consider the effect of the existence of such graffiti,
writings or other inscriptions on a normal person of normal sensibility, and
the environment in which the graffiti, writings or other inscriptions exists
including, for instance, whether in an urban or rural setting.
   (B)   The Director of Public Services, or his or her designee, shall not
find a nuisance to exist unless such hearing officer finds the existence of an
injurious effect upon the public in general. The decision of the Director of
Public Services, or his or her designee, is final, subject to the right of the
property owner to appeal to the Mayor and City Council pursuant to
Chapter 2.64, except that the notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of
the hearing, or within ten days of the mailing of notice of the decision by the
Director of Public Services, whichever occurs last. If a decision is rendered
at the time of the hearing, and a representative of the property owner was
present at such hearing, no mailing of the decision shall be required. The
decision of the Mayor and City Council, upon any appeal, shall be final and
conclusive. Any person failing to protest, as authorized in §
8.69.030, or failing to appeal after the decision of the Director of Public
Services shall be deemed to have waived any and all objections, and the
Director of Public Services shall be deemed to have acquired jurisdiction to
abate the nuisance and have the work of removal performed.
(Ord. MC-370, passed 5-22-1984)
§ 8.69.060 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE.
   Upon acquiring jurisdiction, the Director of Public Services shall abate the
nuisance, and he or she and his or her assistants or deputies, or any person,
firm or corporation under contract to do the work, are expressly authorized to
enter upon private property for that purpose.
(Ord. MC-370, passed 5-22-1984)
§ 8.69.070 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE BY PROPERTY OWNER - TIME LIMIT.
   Any property owner shall have the right to have any such nuisance removed or
abated at his or her own expense provided the same is done within ten days
after the mailing of the “notice to remove graffiti,” as provided in §
8.69.080; provided such abatement is performed to the satisfaction of the
Director of Public Services. If additional time is desired in the order to
remove the graffiti writings or other inscriptions, a request therefor shall be
made to the Director of Public Services, who may grant additional time within
which the property owner shall have the right to have any such nuisance removed
at his or her own expense. Upon expiration of such additional time, however, if
the nuisance is not removed, the Director of Public Services shall be deemed to
have acquired jurisdiction to abate the nuisance without further notice or
hearing and shall have the authority to proceed to abate the nuisance.
(Ord. MC-370, passed 5-22-1984)
§ 8.69.080 ASSESSMENT FOR ABATEMENT BY CITY - FILING OF OBJECTION.
   The Director of Public Services shall, upon completion of the graffiti
abatement, itemize the costs thereof, including incidental expenses which, if
unpaid, shall be assessed against and become a lien upon the property on which
the nuisance was abated to be collected at the time and in the manner of the
real property taxes by the Tax Collector, pursuant to the procedure set forth
in Chapter 3.68. The Director of Public Services shall forthwith initiate
proceedings before the Board of Building Commissioners under Chapter 8.30 for
determination and collection of the assessment for costs of abatement.

(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.030 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter, in combination with the flood provisions of
the building codes, shall apply to all proposed development entirely or
partially in flood hazard areas established in §
8.79.110.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.040 PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES.
   The purposes and objectives of this chapter and the flood load and flood
resistant construction requirements of the building codes are to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific flood hazard areas through the
establishment of comprehensive regulations for management of flood hazard areas
designed to:
   (A)   Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service
during times of flooding;
   (B)   Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to
prevent or minimize future flood damage;
   (C)   Manage the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial
functions of the floodplain;
   (D)   Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation,
drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
divert floodwater or increase flood hazards;
   (F)   Contribute to improved construction techniques in the floodplain;
   (G)   Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;
   (H)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood hazard areas;
   (I)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding;
   (J)   Ensure that property owners, occupants and potential owners are aware
of property located in flood hazard areas;
   (K)   Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood
control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and
   (L)   Meet the requirements of the national flood insurance program for
community participation as set forth in 44 C.F.R. § 59.22.

§ 8.79.050 COORDINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS CODE.
   Pursuant to the requirement established in state statute that the city
administer and enforce the California Building Standards Code, the Mayor and
City Council acknowledges that the building codes contain certain provisions
that apply to the design and construction of buildings and structures in flood
hazard areas. Therefore, this chapter is intended to be administered and
enforced in conjunction with the building codes.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
Cross-reference:
   California Building Standards Code, see §
8.79.010
§ 8.79.060 WARNING.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the building
codes is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur.
Flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. Enforcement of
this chapter and the building codes does not imply that land outside the
special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard
areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and
base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood
insurance rate maps and the requirements of 44 C.F.R. pts. 59 and 60 may be
revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to
revise this chapter to remain eligible for participation in the national flood
insurance program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use or future use is
implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.070 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   These regulations shall not create liability on the part of Mayor and City
Council, any officer or employee thereof, the state or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
chapter, or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. The Floodplain
Administrator and any employee charged with the enforcement of this chapter,
while acting for the community in good faith and without malice in the
discharge of the duties required by this chapter or other pertinent law or
ordinance, shall not thereby be rendered liable personally and is relieved from
personal liability for any damage accruing to persons or property as a result
of any act or by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of official
duties. Any suit instituted against an officer or employee because of an act
performed by that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties and
under the provisions of this chapter shall be defended by a legal
representative of the community until the final termination of the proceedings.
The Floodplain Administrator and any subordinate shall not be liable for cost
in any action, suit or proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.080 OTHER LAWS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions
of local, state or federal law.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.090 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations supersede any ordinance in effect in flood hazard areas.
However, this chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing ordinances, including land development regulations, subdivision
regulations, zoning ordinances, storm water management regulations or building
codes, nor any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. In the event
of an overlap or conflict between this chapter and any other ordinance, code,

§ 8.79.280 ADDITIONAL ANALYSES AND CERTIFICATIONS.
   As applicable to the location and nature of the proposed development
activity, and in addition to the requirements of this chapter, the applicant
shall have the following analyses signed and sealed by a qualified state
licensed civil engineer for submission with the site plan and construction
documents.
   (A)   For development activities proposed to be located in a floodway, a
floodway encroachment analysis that demonstrates that the encroachment of the
proposed development will not cause any increase in base flood elevations;
where the applicant proposes to undertake development activities that do
increase base flood elevations, the applicant shall submit such analysis to
FEMA, as specified in §
8.79.290, and shall submit the conditional letter of map revision, when issued
by FEMA, with the site plan and construction documents.
   (B)   For development activities proposed to be located in a riverine flood
hazard area where base flood elevations are included in the flood insurance
study or on the FIRM but floodways have not been designated, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses that demonstrate that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated flood hazard
area encroachments, will not increase the base flood elevation more than one
foot at any point within the community. This requirement does not apply in
isolated flood hazard areas not connected to a riverine flood hazard area or in
flood hazard areas identified as Zone AO or Zone AH.
   (C)   For alteration of a watercourse, an engineering analysis prepared in
accordance with standard engineering practices that demonstrates the flood-
carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse will
not be decreased, and certification that the altered watercourse shall be
maintained in a manner which preserves the channel’s flood-carrying capacity.
The applicant shall submit the analysis to FEMA as specified in §
8.79.290. The applicant shall notify the chief executive officer of adjacent
communities and the State Department of Water Resources. The Floodplain
Administrator shall maintain a copy of the notification in the permit records
and shall submit a copy to FEMA.

additional analyses are submitted to support an application, the applicant has
the right to seek a letter of map change from FEMA to change the base flood
elevations, change floodway boundaries or change boundaries of flood hazard
areas shown on FIRMs, and to submit such data to FEMA for such purposes. The
analyses shall be prepared by a qualified state licensed civil engineer in a
format required by FEMA. Submittal requirements and processing fees shall be
the responsibility of the applicant. Provided FEMA issues a conditional letter
of map revision, construction of proposed flood control projects and land
preparation for development are permitted, including clearing, excavation,
grading and filling. Permits for construction of buildings shall not be issued
until the applicant satisfies the FEMA requirements for issuance of a letter of
map revision.

ARTICLE 106. INSPECTIONS
§ 8.79.300 INSPECTIONS, IN GENERAL.
   Development for which a permit for floodplain development is required shall
be subject to inspection. Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be
construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this chapter or
the Building Code. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel
the provisions of this chapter or the building code or other ordinances shall
not be valid.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.310 INSPECTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT OTHER THAN BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   The Floodplain Administrator shall make, or cause to be made, inspections of
all development other than buildings and structures that is authorized by
issuance of a permit for floodplain development under this chapter. The
Floodplain Administrator shall inspect flood hazard areas, from time to time,
to determine when development is undertaken without issuance of a permit.

ARTICLE 107. VARIANCES
§ 8.79.340 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The considerations and conditions for variances set forth in this
article are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain
to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be issued
for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that
complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional
hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The
characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the
structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. The issuance of a variance
is for floodplain management purposes only. Federal flood insurance premium
rates are determined by the national flood insurance program according to
actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
   (B)   It is the duty of the Mayor and City Council of the city to promote
public health, safety and welfare and minimize losses from flooding. This duty
is so compelling and the implications of property damage and the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from
the elevation or other requirements in the building codes should be quite rare.
The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage, and
minimizing recovery costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering, can only be met
when variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance requirements in
this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met
before a variance can be properly issued. The criteria are designed to screen
out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more
appropriate.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.350 VARIANCES; GENERAL.
   The Development Review Committee (“DRC”) shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the strict application of this chapter.

§ 8.79.360 LIMITATIONS ON AUTHORITY.
   The Development Review Committee (“DRC”) shall base its determination on
technical justifications submitted by applicants; the considerations and
conditions set forth in this article; the comments and recommendations of the
Floodplain Administrator and Building Official, as applicable; and has the
right to attach such conditions to variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes and objectives of this chapter and the Building Code.

   A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement or
rehabilitation of a historic structure upon a determination that the proposed
repair, improvement or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. When
the proposed work precludes the structure’s continued designation as a historic
building, a variance shall not be granted and the structure and any repair,
improvement and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the
Building Code.

the Residential Code (CCR Title 24 Part 2.5) are met, as applicable, and the
variance is the minimum necessary to allow the construction or substantial
improvement, and that all due consideration has been given to use of methods
and materials that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.410 CONSIDERATIONS FOR ISSUANCE OF VARIANCES.
   In reviewing applications for variances; all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors; all other requirements of this chapter and the Building Code,
as applicable; and the following shall be considered:
   (A)   The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands
resulting in further injury or damage;
   (B)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (C)   The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners;
   (D)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to
the community;
   (E)   The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development
that are not subject to flooding or erosion and the necessity of a waterfront
location, where applicable;
   (F)   The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and
anticipated development;
   (G)   The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
   (H)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
   (I)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and
sediment transport of the floodwater and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
   (J)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and
bridges.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.420 CONDITIONS FOR ISSUANCE OF VARIANCES.
   Variances shall only be issued upon:
   (A)   Submission by the applicant of a showing of good and sufficient cause
that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration or topography of the
site limit compliance with any provision of this chapter or renders the
elevation standards of the Building Code inappropriate;
   (B)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that
render the lot undevelopable;
   (C)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public or future property owners, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances;
   (D)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and
   (E)   When the request is to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new
building or substantial improvement of a building below the base flood
elevation, notification to the applicant in writing over the signature of the
Floodplain Administrator specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that issuance
of a variance to construct below the elevation required in the Building Code
will result in increased premium rates for federal flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and that such
construction below the required elevation increases risks to life and property.

ARTICLE 108. VIOLATIONS
§ 8.79.430 VIOLATIONS.
   Any development in any flood hazard area that is being performed without an
issued permit or that is in conflict with an issued permit shall be deemed a
violation. A building or structure without the documentation of the elevation
of the lowest floor, other required design certifications or other evidence of
compliance required by this chapter or the Building Code is presumed to be a
violation until such time as required documentation is submitted. Violation of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.440 AUTHORITY.
   The Floodplain Administrator is authorized to serve notices of violation or
stop work orders to owners of property involved, to the owner’s agent or to the
person or persons doing the work for development that is not within the scope
of the Building Codes, but is regulated by this chapter and that is determined
to be a violation.
(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.450 UNLAWFUL CONTINUANCE.
   Any person who shall continue any work after having been served with a
notice of violation or a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove or remedy a violation or unsafe condition, shall
be subject to penalties as prescribed by law. Penalties, fines and remediation
fees will be determined by Public Works Department on a case-by-case basis.

(Ord. MC-1622, passed 1-17-2024)
§ 8.79.470 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same parcel of property as a
principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the
principal structure. For floodplain management purposes, the term includes only
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES used for parking and storage.
   ALTERATION OF A WATERCOURSE. A dam, impoundment, channel relocation, change
in channel alignment, channelization or change in cross-sectional area of the
channel or the channel capacity, or any other form of modification which may

given year. (Also defined in CCR Title 24, Part 2.)
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION. The elevation of the base flood, including wave
height, relative to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (“NGVD”), North
American Vertical Datum (“NAVD”) or other datum specified on the flood
insurance rate map (“FIRM”). (Also defined in CCR Title 24, Part 2.)
   BASEMENT. For the purpose of floodplain management, the portion of a
building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. (Also
defined in CCR Title 24 Part 2.)

      (2)   Part 2.5, applicable to one- and two-family dwellings and
townhouses not more than three stories, and accessory structures;
      (3)   Part 10, applicable to existing buildings (as defined in that
code); and

areas: (Also defined in CCR Title 24, Part 2.)
      (1)   Area with a floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any year; and
      (2)   Area designated as a flood hazard area on a community’s flood
hazard map, or otherwise legally designated.
   DESIGN FLOOD ELEVATION. The elevation of the “design flood,” including wave
height, relative to the datum specified on the community’s legally designated
flood hazard map. In areas designated as Zone AO, the DESIGN FLOOD ELEVATION
shall be the elevation of the highest existing grade of the building’s
perimeter plus the depth number (in feet) specified on the flood hazard map. In
areas designated as Zone AO where a depth number is not specified on the map,
the depth number shall be taken as being equal to two feet (610 mm). (Also

   EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP. For the purpose of variances from this chapter or the
Building Code, the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to
grant a requested variance. Mere economic or financial hardship is not
EXCEPTIONAL. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors do not, as a rule,
qualify as EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIPS. All of these circumstances can be resolved
through other means without granting variances, even when the alternatives are
more expensive or require the property owner to build elsewhere or put the
parcel to a different use than originally intended.

or property, making a victim of the deprived person or the public. As it
pertains to buildings granted variances to be constructed below the elevation
required by the Building Code, future owners or tenants of such buildings and
the community as a whole may bear the burden of increased risk of damage from
floods, increased cost of flood insurance and increased recovery costs,
inconvenience, danger and suffering.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use that cannot perform its intended purpose,
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, including only
docking facilities, port facilities necessary for the loading or unloading of

form” be submitted to the Development Services Department for approval of these
discharges, five days prior to any planned discharges or, as soon as possible,
for any unplanned discharges. The notification form is available from the
Development Services Department counter. Monitoring may also be required for
these discharges.
   (B)   The Regional Board may issue waste discharge requirements for
discharges exempted from NPDES requirements, if identified to be a significant
source of pollutants. The Executive Officer of the Board may also add
categories of non-storm water discharges that are not significant sources of
pollutants or remove categories of non-storm water discharges listed above
based upon a finding that the discharges are a significant source of
pollutants. In this case, the list of exempted discharges above would be
adjusted accordingly.
§ 8.80.208 COMPLIANCE WITH BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (“BMPs”).
   Any person undertaking any activity or operation in the city that could
potentially cause or contribute to storm water pollution or a discharge of non-
storm water shall comply with all applicable best management practices (“BMPs”)
as listed in the “California Storm Water Best Management Practice Handbooks” or
the current county storm water program’s “Report of Waste Discharge” to reduce
pollutants in storm water runoff and reduce non-storm water discharges to the
city’s storm water drainage system to the maximum extent practicable or to the
extent required by law.
§ 8.80.209 TREATMENT OF STORM WATER RUNOFF.
   If a discharger has the potential to introduce pollutants into the city’s
storm water drainage system or is exceeding EPA parameter benchmark values, the
city may require the installation of appropriate storm water treatment
equipment or devices. These devices shall reduce pollutant constituents to the
degree of reduction attainable through the application of the best management
practices to the maximum extent practicable. Any required treatment equipment
or devices shall be provided, operated and maintained at the expense of the
discharger. Detailed plans showing the treatment device and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable
to the city before construction or installation of the equipment. The review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the
discharger from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
treat storm water runoff or prevent the introduction of storm water pollutants
to comply with this chapter.
§ 8.80.210 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   A discharger shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against
it alleging a violation of §
8.80.206 where the discharger can demonstrate it did not know or have reason to
know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges
from other sources, would cause violation of this chapter or the areawide urban
storm water runoff permit.
§ 8.80.211 SPILL CONTAINMENT.
   (A)   Persons storing chemicals or chemical waste outdoors shall be required
to install spill containment subject to requirements established by the City
Engineer and federal, state and county standards. Persons storing any other
materials or equipment that are potential sources of storm water pollution are
also required to install spill containment.
   (B)   No person shall operate a spill containment system that could allow
incompatible materials and/or wastes to mix, thereby creating hazardous or
toxic substances in the event of failure of one or more containers. Spill
containment systems shall consist of a system of dikes, walls, barriers, berms
and/or other devices designed to contain the spillage of the liquid contents of
the containers stored in them and to minimize the buildup of storm water from
precipitation, and run-on from roof drainage and outside areas. If the spill
containment system does not have a roof which covers the entire contained area,
the spill containment system shall have the capacity to contain precipitation
from at least a 24-hour, 25-year rainfall event, plus 10% of the total volume
of the material stored there or the volume of the largest container, whichever
is greater. Spill containment systems shall also be constructed of impermeable
and non-reactive materials to the materials and/or wastes being contained.
Spilled and/or leaked materials and/or wastes and any accumulated precipitation
shall be removed from the spill containment system in as timely a manner as is
necessary to prevent the overflow of the spill containment system.
   (C)   Unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer, all chemicals or
wastes discharged within the spill containment system shall be disposed of in
accordance with all applicable federal, state and local rules, regulations and
laws, and shall not be discharged into the city’s sanitary sewer system, storm
water drainage system or onto the ground.
§ 8.80.212 IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION OF ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (A)   Protection of the city’s storm water drainage system from the
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or wastes is the responsibility of
the person or persons in charge of such material. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the City Engineer for review, and shall be approved by the City
Engineer prior to any construction. All new and existing dischargers shall
complete such a plan. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify
his or her facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   A notice shall be permanently posted in a prominent place advising
employees whom to contact in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers
shall ensure that all employees are advised of the emergency notification
procedures. In the event of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility
of the discharger to immediately telephone and notify the proper authorities.
   (C)   All discharges released into the city’s storm water drainage system,
including a street or gutter, shall be immediately reported to the City
Development Services Department and Fire Department. All discharges that pose a
threat to human health or the environment shall be reported to the Executive
Officer of the State Regional Water Quality Control Board within 24 hours by
telephone or e-mail and followed with a written report of the spill event
within five days. At minimum, all sewage spills over 1,000 gallons and all
reportable quantities of hazardous materials or hazardous waste shall be
reported within 24 hours.
§ 8.80.213 WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OF ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   Within five working days following an accidental discharge into the city’s
storm water drainage system, the person or persons in charge of the material
and/or waste which was accidentally discharged shall submit a written report to
the City Engineer. The report shall describe in detail the type and volume of
the material and/or waste and the cause of the discharge. The report shall also
describe, in detail, all corrective actions taken and measures to be taken to
prevent future occurrences. Such notification of the accidental discharge shall
not relieve the user of any fines or civil penalties incurred as a result of
the event or any other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other
applicable laws.
§ 8.80.214 AUTHORITY TO INSPECT.
   (A)   The City Engineer, or his or her designated representative, shall be
authorized, at any reasonable time, to enter the premises of any discharger to
the city’s storm water drainage system to determine compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, and to:
      (1)   Conduct inspection, monitoring and/or other authorized duties to
enforce the provisions of this chapter;
      (2)   Review any records, reports, test results or other information
required to enforce the provisions of this chapter. Such review may include the
necessity to photograph, videotape or copy any applicable information; and
      (3)   Inspect any chemicals, materials, wastes, storage areas, storage
containers and waste generating processes, treatment facilities and discharge
locations. Such inspection may include the necessity to photograph or videotape
any applicable chemicals, materials, wastes, storage areas, storage containers,
waste generating processes, treatment facilities and discharge locations.
   (B)   The City Engineer, or his or her designated representative, shall
provide adequate identification when entering the premises of any discharger.
If such entry is refused or cannot be obtained, the City Engineer shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure lawful entry and inspection
of the premises.
   (C)   If the City Engineer has reasonable cause to believe that non-storm
water discharge conditions on or emanating from the premises are of a nature so
as to require immediate inspection to safeguard public health or safety, the
City Engineer shall have the right to immediately enter and inspect said
property and may use any reasonable means required to effect such entry and
make such inspection, regardless if said property is occupied or unoccupied and
regardless if formal permission to inspect said property has been obtained.
   (D)   Where a discharger has instituted security measures requiring proper
identification and clearance before entry onto the premises, the discharger
shall make all necessary arrangements with its security agents in order that,
upon presentation of such identification, the City Engineer, or his or her
designated representative(s), shall be permitted to enter the premises without
delay, for the purpose of performing his or her authorized duties. For
facilities which require special clearances to conduct inspections, it shall be
the responsibility of the discharger to obtain all necessary clearances on
behalf of the city so that the inspection is not impaired.

or by directly seeking court action. Administrative orders may include
compliance orders, stop work orders, cease and desist orders, termination of
service orders and immediate termination of service orders.
   (A)   Compliance order.
      (1)   (a)   The City Engineer, or his or her designee, may issue a
compliance order to any discharger who fails to correct a violation of this
chapter, any NPDES storm water permit or the basin plan. The order shall be in
writing, specify the violation(s) and require appropriate compliance measures
within a specified time period.
         (b)   The compliance order may include the following terms and
requirements:
            1.   Specific steps and time schedules for compliance as reasonably
necessary to eliminate an existing prohibited discharge or illegal connection
or to prevent the imminent threat of a prohibited discharge;
            2.   Specific requirements for containment, cleanup, removal,
storage, installation of overhead covering or proper disposal of any pollutant
having the potential to contact storm water runoff;
            3.   Installation of storm water treatment devices, containment
structures, wash racks and addition and removal of storm water drains; and
            4.   Any other terms or requirements reasonably calculated to
prevent imminent threat of or continuing violations of this chapter, including,
but not limited to, requirements for compliance with best management practices
guidance documents promulgated by any federal, state or regional agency.
      (2)   The City Engineer, or his or her designee, may adopt a proposed
compliance schedule submitted by the user or may adopt a revised compliance
schedule if, in his or her judgment, the proposed compliance schedule would
allow the user to cause harm to the receiving waters and/or the city’s storm
drainage system.
      (3)   A compliance order shall require the discharger to pay a $1,000
penalty fee to the city for the issuance thereof.
   (B)   Stop work order.
      (1)   The City Engineer or Building Official may serve a written stop
work order on any person engaged in doing, or causing to be done, new
construction, tenant improvements, alterations or additions, if:
         (a)   No construction permit has been granted by the city;
         (b)   Work has begun prior to the submittal of a written storm water
quality management plan (“SWQMP”) and subsequent approval by the City Engineer,
or his or her designee; or
         (c)   Violations of this article are found at the site of the new
construction, tenant improvements, alterations or additions.
      (2)   Any person served a stop work order shall stop such work forthwith
until written authorization to continue is received from the City Engineer or
Building Official. A stop work order shall require the discharger to pay a
$1,000 penalty fee to the city for the issuance thereof.
   (C)   Cease and desist order.
      (1)   When the City Engineer, or his or her designee, finds that any
industrial and/or commercial discharger has violated or threatens to violate
any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained in this chapter, any NPDES
storm water permit or the basin plan or NPDES storm water permit, the city may
issue a cease and desist order directing the discharger to:
         (a)   Immediately discontinue any illicit connection or prohibited
discharge to the city’s storm water drainage system;
         (b)   Immediately contain or divert any flow of water off the
property, where the flow is occurring in violation of any provision of this
chapter; and
         (c)   Immediately discontinue any other violation of this chapter.
      (2)   A cease and desist order shall require the discharger to pay a
$1,000 penalty fee to the city for the issuance thereof.
   (D)   Termination of service. When the City Engineer finds any industrial
and/or commercial discharger, who has a direct connection into the city’s storm
water drainage system or has violated an administrative order, the City
Engineer may terminate storm drain service to the discharger. The discharger
shall be liable for all costs for termination of storm drain service incurred
by the city. This provision is in addition to any other statues, rules or
regulations authorizing termination of service for delinquency payment or for
any other reasons. Storm drain service shall be re-instituted by the City
Engineer after the discharger has complied with all the provisions of the
administrative order. The discharger shall also be liable for all costs for re-
instituting storm drain service.
   (E)   Immediate termination of service.
      (1)   The City Engineer may immediately suspend storm drain service and
any non-storm water discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the
opinion of the City Engineer, to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons or the environment, or which significantly or could
significantly cause pollution to the receiving waters, ground and/or storm
drainage system of the city. Any industrial and/or commercial discharger
notified that their storm drain service has been suspended shall immediately
cease and eliminate the discharge into the city storm water drainage system.
      (2)   In the event of failure to comply voluntarily with the termination
of service order, the City Engineer shall take appropriate steps, including
immediate severance of all applicable storm drain connections. All persons
responsible for a discharge that may endanger the health or welfare of the
community or the environment shall be liable for all costs incurred by the city
in terminating storm drain service. Storm drain service shall be re-instituted
by the City Engineer after the actual or threatened discharge has been
eliminated. A detailed written statement, submitted by the industrial and/or
commercial discharger, describing the cause of the harmful contribution and the
measures to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City
Engineer within ten working days of the date of storm drain service
termination.
§ 8.80.604 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.

administrative hearing, at which time, a discharger who causes or allows or who
has caused or allowed an unauthorized discharge to enter into the city’s storm
water drainage system, or who continues to allow, a violation of this chapter
to exist may show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken
against him or her. The City Administrator, or the City Administrator’s
designee, shall preside over the administrative hearing, at which time each
party, including the discharger and the City Engineer, or his or her designee,
shall have the right to present evidence.
   (B)   A notice of hearing shall be served on the discharger specifying the
time and place of the hearing and referencing the specific violation and/or
violations of this chapter, the reasons why the action is to be taken and the
proposed enforcement action, directing the discharger to show cause before the
hearing officer why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, at least ten working days prior to the hearing.
Service of the notice of hearing may be made on any agent or officer of the
discharger.
§ 8.80.605 ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 54739 and 54740.5, the City Engineer
may issue an administrative complaint to any person who violates this chapter,
any prohibition or limitation thereof or any compliance order, cease and desist
order, stop work order or injunction. The administrative complaint shall allege
the act or failure to act that constitutes the violation, the proposed civil
penalty and the authority under which it is imposed. The administrative
complaint, served on the alleged violator by personal delivery or by certified
mail, shall inform the person served that a hearing before the City
Administrator, or the City Administrator’s designee, shall be conducted within
60 days of the service of the complaint. The right to a hearing may be waived
by the person who has been issued the administrative complaint, in which case
the city shall not conduct a hearing. A person dissatisfied with the decision
of the City Administrator may appeal to the Mayor and City Council of the city
within 30 days of notice of the City Administrator’s decision.
   (B)   If, after the hearing or appeal, if any, it is found that the person
has violated reporting or discharge requirements, the City Administrator or
Mayor and City Council may assess a civil penalty against that person. In
determining the amount of the civil penalty, the City Administrator or Mayor
and City Council may take into consideration all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
economic benefit derived through any non-compliance, the nature and persistence
of the violation, the length of time over which the violation occurs and
corrective action, if any, attempted or taken by the discharger.

in violation of any stop work order, cease and desist order or other orders, or
prohibition issued, reissued or adopted by the city; and
      (4)   The amount of any civil penalties imposed under this section which
have remained delinquent for a period of 60 days shall constitute a lien
against the real property of the discharger from which the discharge originated
resulting in the imposition of the civil penalty.
   (D)   The lien provided herein shall have no force and effect until recorded
with the County Recorder and when recorded shall have the force and effect and
priority of a judgment lien and continue for ten years from the time of
recording unless sooner released, and shall be renewable in accordance with the
provisions of the Cal. Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 683.110 to 683.220,

shall become effective and final upon issuance thereof, and payment shall
become due within 30 days of issuance of an invoice by the city. Copies of
these orders shall be served by personal service or by registered mail upon the
party served with the administrative complaint and upon other persons who
appeared at the hearing and requested a copy.
   (G)   The city may, at its option, elect to petition the Superior Court to
confirm any order establishing civil penalties and enter judgment in conformity
therewith in accordance with the provisions of the Cal. Code of Civil
Procedure, §§ 1285 to 1287.6, inclusive.
§ 8.80.606 COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES.
   Any person who damages monitoring equipment; has the potential to affect or

storm drainage system which causes, or has the potential to cause, increased
maintenance of the system, non-routine inspection or sampling of the system,
system blockages or other damage or interference in the city’s storm water
drainage system, or causes any other damages, including the imposition of fines
or penalties on the city by federal, state or local regulatory agencies, shall
be liable to the city for all damages and additional costs, including fines and

shall make a written decision regarding the appeal. The decision of the City
Administrator, or the City Administrator’s designee, shall be final. The
imposition of fines or penalties shall be stayed during the appeal period.
§ 8.80.608 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   In addition to the penalties established by this chapter, any threat to
public health, safety or welfare shall be declared and deemed a public
nuisance. Such public nuisance may be summarily abated and/or remedied by the
City Engineer, and/or civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken by the City Attorney. The cost of such
abatement, remediation and/or restoration shall be borne by the owner, lessee
or tenant of the property causing the violation. The cost thereof shall be a
lien upon and against the property and such lien shall continue in existence
until the same shall be paid.
ARTICLE 7. JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES

violation, any economic benefit gained through the discharger’s violation,
corrective actions by the discharger, the compliance history of the discharger
and any factor as justice requires.
   (C)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against a discharger. The city may

violator of this chapter fails or refuses to pay said penalty within 30 days
from the date that it has been assessed.

telephone lines, by direct connection or otherwise, a prerecorded message
indicating the existence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to which
police are expected to respond.
   COMMON CAUSE. A common technical difficulty or malfunction which causes an
alarm system to generate a series of false alarms, all of which occur within a
72-hour period. The series of false alarms shall be counted as one false alarm
only if the cause of the series of false alarms is repaired before it generates
additional false alarms beyond the 72-hour period, documentation of the repair
is provided to the Police Chief and during the 30-day period following the
repair, the alarm system generates no additional false alarms from the
documented cause.
   FALSE ALARM. An alarm system signal which necessitates or causes response by
police when an emergency does not exist. This does not include alarms caused by
acts of nature.
   INTRUSION ALARM. An alarm system signaling an entry or attempted entry into
the area protected by the systems.
   PANIC ALARM. An alarm system by which the signal transmission is initiated
by the direct action of a person.

altering, replacing, moving or installing of an alarm system in or on any
building, place or premises within the city without first having registered his
or her name and filed with the Police Chief a copy of the alarm agent
registration card issued by the state. Nothing in this section shall require a
person to so register in order to install, service, repair, alter, replace or
move an alarm system on the premises owned or occupied by that person. Nothing
in this section shall require a person to register who is merely a salesperson
for any business not required to obtain an alarm business permit under the
provisions of §
8.81.040, if the salesperson does not engage in any other activities related to

prescribed by the Chief of Police and shall include the address of the premises
wherein the system is to be located and the name, address and telephone number
of the applicant and the person or business who will render service or repair
during any hour of the day or night, and the type or types of systems to be

residence. The permit may authorize intrusion, panic and/or robbery coverage.
The permit may include the primary residence and any outbuildings (such as
garages, sheds or hobby shops) on the parcel that are not used for commercial
purposes. A separate permit must be issued for any buildings on the property
that are used for commercial purposes. If the residence and the outbuildings

   (A)   It is the intent of the City Council, by the adoption of this chapter,
to impose on and collect from the person(s) in charge of or responsible for an

having custody of a minor. The purpose of this chapter is to recover the actual
cost to the city incurred by providing these police services. The City Council
believes it is necessary that persons voluntarily incurring special and
extraordinary police services pay to the city the reasonable cost of providing
such services.
   (B)   This chapter is not intended to apply, and shall not apply, to events
of a political or religious nature, or any event involving speech protected by
the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or by the California Constitution.

filed with the Chief of Police.

imposed upon him or her by law, give written warning notice to the person in
charge of the premises that if a second response is necessary because of a
continuation of any objectionable activity that the person in charge will be
held liable to the city for the cost of all subsequent law enforcement services
necessary to abate the disturbance or other activity giving rise to law
enforcement services over and above the normal services expended in connection
with the first call.
   (B)   If an unscheduled event occurs and a law enforcement officer
investigating the matter determines that the same is a threat to the public
peace, health, safety or general welfare or constitutes a nuisance of an
immediate nature such that a written warning is not feasible, a written warning
shall not be required and the person in charge will be held liable to the city
for the cost of all law enforcement services necessary to abate the disturbance
or other activity giving rise to law enforcement services over and above the
normal services expended in connection with the call.
   (C)   (1)   The personnel and equipment of the law enforcement agency
utilized after the first warning, if provided, to control or abate the nuisance
or to protect the public peace, health, safety or general welfare shall be
deemed to be extraordinary law enforcement services over and above the normal
services provided citywide and the cost of said extraordinary law enforcement
services, including damage to city or law enforcement property, shall be billed
to and is the legal responsibility of the person in charge. In the event a
written warning is not feasible, then personnel and equipment of the law
enforcement agency called in, including, but not limited to, mutual aid
agencies, to control or abate the nuisance or to protect the public peace,
health, safety or general welfare shall be deemed to be extraordinary law
enforcement services over and above the normal services provided citywide and
the cost of said extraordinary law enforcement services, including damage to
city or law enforcement property, shall be billed to and is the legal
responsibility of the person in charge.
      (2)   In the event that any provision of this chapter, or any part
thereof, or any application thereof to any person or circumstances, is for any
reason held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or ineffective by a
court of competent jurisdiction on its face or as applied, such holding shall
not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this chapter, or any
part thereof, or any application thereof to any person or circumstance or of
said provision as applied to any other person or circumstance. It is declared
to be the legislative intent of the city that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective provision not been
included herein.

matter before the City Administrator who shall, along with a representative of
the law enforcement agency, review the necessity of the services and the cost

§ 8.90.010 TITLE.
   This chapter may be cited as the “Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization
Ordinance” of the city.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.020 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   Mobile home owners have a substantial investment in their
residences and appurtenances for which space is rented or leased. Alternate
sites for relocation of mobile homes are difficult to find due to the shortage
of vacant spaces; the restrictions of age, size or style of mobile homes
permitted in many parks; and related to the installation of mobile homes,
including permits, landscaping and site preparation. Additionally, the cost of
moving a mobile home is substantial, and the risk of damage in moving is
significant.
      (2)   The result of these conditions is the creation of a captive market
of mobile home owners and tenants. This immobility, in turn, contributes to the
creation of a great imbalance in the bargaining relationship between park
owners and mobile home park tenants in favor of the park owners.
   (B)   Because mobile homes are often occupied by senior citizens, persons on
fixed income and persons of low- or moderate-income, exorbitant rent
adjustments fall upon these individuals with particular harshness. The
continuing possibility of unreasonable space rental adjustments in mobile home
parks threatens to diminish the value of the investment of the mobile home
owners. Further, existing state law permits mobile home park owners to require
mobile home owners to make modifications to their homes for reasons of
aesthetics or conformity to park standards that amount to capital improvements
which would accrue to the benefit of the park owner by potentially increasing
the market value of the park itself.
   (C)   This Council finds and declares it necessary to facilitate and
encourage fair bargaining between mobile home owners and park owners in order
to achieve mutually satisfactory agreements regarding space rental rates in
mobile home parks. Absent such agreements, this Council further finds and
declares it necessary to protect the owners and residents of mobile homes from
unreasonable space rental adjustments while simultaneously recognizing and
providing for the need of park owners to receive a just and reasonable return
on their property.

   (A)   New space or first time space exemption. Space rent or space rent
adjustments for new mobile home spaces first rented after the effective date of

that those rents would have been controlled had the spaces been previously
occupied. There shall be no prospective exemption in such circumstances,
however, as to rents that may be adjusted annually under this chapter after a

permissible future rent adjustments shall be the date of first rental or
conveyance.
   (B)   Vacancies.

coercion by the landlord vacates the rental space or if the tenant dies and
there is no surviving cohabitant.
      (5)   Where the rent is increased pursuant to this division (B), the
landlord shall, at the time the rent increase is implemented, provide the new
tenant with written notice of the previous base rent for the space, the new
base rent for the space in both dollar and percentage terms and the anniversary
date for the space for purposes of the annual permissive inflationary
adjustment to rent allowed under §
8.90.100(A).

addition to any other rent increases authorized by this chapter, including, but
not limited to, the annual permissive inflationary adjustment to rent allowed
under §

chapter shall preclude any landlord from implementing any rent increases that

filed.
   (E)   The registration and re-registration requirement provided for in this
section, or which may be hereafter established by the City Manager, shall apply
to all mobile home parks including those exempt from the space rent ceiling
limitation by reason of the existence of a valid space rent agreement.

§ 8.90.080 SPACE RENT CEILING OR MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE SPACE.
   (A)   Beginning the first month which commences following the day after the
effective date of this chapter when originally adopted on March 24, 1993, no
mobile home park owner shall charge space rent for any mobile home space in an
amount greater than the space rent in effect on December 31, 1988. The space
rent in effect on that date shall be known as the “space rent ceiling.”
   (B)   If there was no space rent in effect on December 31, 1988, the space
rent ceiling shall be the space rent that was charged on the first date that
space rent was charged after December 31, 1988.
   (C)   If a mobile home park is exempted from the application of this chapter
by reason of the existence of a space rent agreement and this agreement
expires, the space rent ceiling for that park shall be the space rent in effect
on the date the agreement expires.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.090 SPACE RENT CEILING ADJUSTMENT - INITIAL ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   No adjustment in space rent ceilings shall be permitted except as
provided for herein.
   (B)   A park owner shall be entitled to an initial permissive adjustment
gross space rental income equal to 80% of the percentage increase in the
consumer price index (“CPI”) from the end of the base year (1988) to the date
of application for the adjustment. The percentage adjustment in the CPI shall
be calculated by subtracting the CPI reported for December 1989 from the most
recently reported monthly CPI preceding the application and then dividing this
remainder by the December 1989 CPI.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.100 SPACE RENT CEILING ADJUSTMENT - ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.
   Commencing in calendar year 1990, park owners shall be entitled to the
following annual adjustments.
   (A)   Permissive adjustment. A park owner shall be entitled to an annual
permissive adjustment of gross space rental income equal to 80% of the
percentage adjustment in the CPI from the date of the most recent initial or
annual adjustment to the date of application for the proposed adjustment.
   (B)   Net operating income adjustment.
      (1)   In the event a park owner believes he or she does not receive a
just and reasonable return on park property after receiving the maximum
permissive adjustment provided for above, said park owner may, upon payment of
a filing fee established by resolution of the Mayor and City Council, file an
application with the City Manager for an adjustment of the space rent ceiling,
providing adequate justification for the proposed increase.
      (2)   If the City Manager shall designate a form for the filing of such
petition, such petition shall be filed upon such form. If no such form shall be
designated, such petition shall be in writing, verified by the applicant and
shall contain the names, address and telephone number of the applicant; the
name and address of the tenant of each rental space which would be affected if
the petition were granted; and a statement of the facts giving rise to the
petition for a net operating income (“NOI”) adjustment in sufficient detail
that if established, such facts would demonstrate the existence of a decrease
in the NOI warranting such NOI adjustment. Within 30 working days after the
petition has been submitted to the City Manager for filing, the petitioner
shall be given notice of the time and place of the hearing, which notice,
together with a copy of the petition, shall be served upon or mailed to each
tenant of a rental space which would be affected by the NOI adjustment if
granted. When a declaration of service has been submitted to the City Manager,
the petition for an NOI adjustment shall be deemed filed.
      (3)   A park owner shall be entitled to an adjustment of the space rent
ceiling so as to enable the park owner’s net operating income (“NOI”) for the
subsequent year to be increased by a rate which, when added to the maximum
permissible adjustment provided for above, will give the park owner a just and
reasonable return on park property.
   (C)   Special assessment based on capital improvements.
      (1)   An application for a special assessment based on the cost of a
completed capital improvement may be filed with the City Manager pursuant to
this division (C). For the purposes of this division (C), CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT
is defined as the installation of new improvements and facilities and/or the
replacement or reconstruction of existing improvements and facilities which
consist of more than ordinary maintenance or repairs, with a useful life of at
least five years, and have been agreed upon between the park owner; the
resident committee, if any; and approved by more than 50% of the owners of all
mobile homes located within the park in an election called to consider the
matter with each space casting one vote.
      (2)   A special assessment may be granted at the discretion of the
hearing officer considering all circumstances without approval of the
homeowners if the capital improvement is necessary to protect the health and
safety of the residents of the park, or to comply with governmental laws or
regulations.
      (3)   Capital improvement assessments shall be amortized over the useful
life of the improvement as set forth in Internal Revenue Service “class life”
tables then in effect, unless the hearing officer, in his or her discretion,
determines that the use of such tables is unreasonable under the circumstances.
      (4)   In addition to the cost of the improvements(s), the assessment
shall include interest at 2% over the prime rate at Bank of America in effect
at the time the assessment is approved calculated annually on the unamortized
cost of improvement.
      (5)   Capital improvement assessments shall be apportioned equally among
all spaces in the mobile home park and shall be payable monthly, and shall be
set forth by the park owner as a separate item from the space rent. The
assessment shall remain in effect until the cost of the improvement, plus
interest as set forth herein, has been fully recovered.
   (D)   Effective. No annual adjustment shall become effective if the previous
annual adjustment became effective within the previous 12 months unless
approved by the hearing officer pursuant to division (B) above.

§ 8.90.120 PETITION BY TENANT.
   (A)   Any tenant of a mobile home rental space affected by this chapter,
upon payment of such filing fee as shall be duly established, may petition the
city for a determination whether a proposed or actual action by the landlord of
such tenant is legal, valid and within the terms of this chapter. If the City
Manager shall establish forms for such petitions, the petition shall be
prepared and submitted upon such form. In the absence of such designated form,
the petition shall contain the name, address and telephone number, if known, of
the landlord, owner, manager or other person authorized to represent the owner
of the mobile home park, a brief statement of the facts giving rise to the
request for interpretation or determination and a statement that a copy of the
petition has been personally served or mailed to the owner, manager or other
person authorized to accept and receive notices to the landlord.
   (B)   In the event that a petition by tenant(s) results in a downward
adjustment in the space rent, the park owner shall not be obligated to adjust
any rent except the rent of those tenant(s) who signed the petition and paid
the established filing fee.

a determination whether a particular course of action by said landlord is
allowable, valid and in conformity with this chapter. The City Manager may
designate forms for the filing of such petitions. In the event that no such
form has been designated, the petition shall be in writing, and shall contain
the name, address and telephone number, if any, of the person requesting the
interpretation or opinion; the name and address of each tenant of a rental unit
owned or managed by the person requesting the interpretation or opinion, if it

§ 8.90.140 CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   The Mayor and City Council shall appoint a hearing officer to hear
matters pertaining to this chapter.
   (B)   Each party to a hearing may have assistance in presenting evidence or
in setting forth by argument his or her position, from an attorney or such
other person as may be designated by said party.
   (C)   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply in proceedings; however, all
oral testimony offered as evidence shall be under oath.
   (D)   In the event that any party shall fail to appear at the time and place
set for hearing of a petition, the hearing officer may hear and review such
evidence as may be presented, and may make such findings and decisions as shall
be supported by the evidence presented.
   (E)   The hearing officer shall base his or her decision on evidence
presented at the hearing and may consider any evidence resulting from
independent investigations of the City Manager pursuant to §
8.90.110(B)(5), where such evidence has been disclosed to the parties.
   (F)   (1)   The hearing officer shall make findings based on the evidence as
to each fact relevant to the hearing officer’s decision on the petition.
      (2)   The decision of the hearing officer shall be based upon the
findings, and shall:
         (a)   Determine whether the action or proposed action of a landlord is
valid, permitted and in conformity with this chapter; and/or
         (b)   Determine whether an adjustment is necessary, and if so, the
nature and amount of relief to be granted or authorized to the landlord or
homeowner.
   (G)   The hearing officer shall consider the evidence and arguments of the
parties no later than 30 days after the matter has been submitted for decision
and the hearing officer shall make her or his final decision at the conclusion
of their deliberations. No rent adjustment will be authorized unless supported
by the evidence. A notice of the hearing officer’s decision shall be sent to
each party to a proceeding. Unless good cause to the contrary shall appear,
each decision of the hearing officer shall apply on a space by space basis,
taking into account the possibility of differences in base rent, services
provided and other facts differentiating rental spaces.
   (H)   Nothing in this chapter, or in any decision of the hearing officer,
shall require any landlord to raise rents or charges to tenants. If an
adjustment in the maximum permissible rent is authorized, a landlord may raise
rents or charges by a lesser amount, or for a lesser time than is authorized by
the decision of the hearing officer.
   (I)   The findings and decisions of the hearing officer shall be a final
administrative action. There shall be no right of appeal to the Mayor and City
Council. Such findings and decisions shall be public records, and may be
certified by the City Clerk. Each decision shall set forth a notice as required
by Cal. Code of Civil Procedure, § 1094.6. The decision shall become effective
upon mailing to the party unless otherwise indicated at the hearing. This
section supersedes Chapter 2.64.

§ 8.90.160 RENT ADJUSTMENT REGULATIONS.
   For purposes of determining allowable rent adjustments, the rules and
regulations set forth in this section shall be used. In authorizing individual
adjustments of the rent ceilings, the hearing officer shall consider the
purposes of this chapter and the requirements of law. The hearing officer may
consider all relevant factors including: increases or decreases in operating
and maintenance expenses; the extent and cost of utilities paid by the owner;
necessary and reasonable capital improvements of the park as distinguished from
normal repair, replacement and maintenance; increases or decreases in
amenities, equipment, insurance or services; substantial deterioration of the
park other than as a result of ordinary wear and tear; failure on the part of
the owner to provide adequate repair; housing services or failure on the part
of the owner to comply with applicable Housing, Health and Safety Codes;
federal and state income tax benefits; the speculative nature of the
investment; whether or not the property is acquired or is held as a long-term
or short-term investment; the owner’s rate of return on investment; the owner’s
current and base year net operating income; and any other factors deemed
relevant by the hearing officer in providing the owner a fair return. A sale of
a mobile home park by the owner, subsequent to June 3, 1991, which results in a
Proposition 13 tax increase, cannot be a factor to be considered in a request
for a rent adjustment by the new owners.

§ 8.90.170 NET OPERATING INCOME.
   Net operating income (“NOI”) shall be gross income less allowable operating
expenses.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.180 GROSS INCOME.
   Gross income equals:
   (A)   Gross rents, computed as gross rental income at 100% paid occupancy;
   (B)   Plus interest from rental deposits, unless directly paid by the
landlord to the tenants;
   (C)   Plus income from miscellaneous sources, including, but not limited to,
laundry facilities, vending machines, amusement devices, cleaning fees or
services, garage and parking fees;
   (D)   Plus all other income or consideration received or receivable for or
in connection with the use or occupancy of rental units; and
   (E)   Minus uncollected rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the extent
that the same are beyond the landlord’s control.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.190 ALLOWABLE OPERATING EXPENSES.
   Operating expenses shall include the following:
   (A)   Real property taxes;
   (B)   Utility costs;
   (C)   Management fees actually paid if management services are contracted
for. If all or a portion of management services are performed by the landlord,
management fees shall include the reasonable value for such landlord performed
services. Management fees greater than 5% of gross income are presumed to be
unreasonable. Such presumption may be rebutted;
   (D)   Other reasonable management expenses, including, but not limited to,
necessary and reasonable advertising, accounting and insurance;
   (E)   Normal repair and maintenance expenses, including, but not limited to,
painting, normal cleaning, fumigation, landscaping and repair of all standard
services, including electrical, plumbing, carpentry, furnished appliances,
drapes, carpets and furniture;
   (F)   Owner-performed labor, which shall be compensated at the following
hourly rates upon documentation of the date, time and nature of the work
performed:
      (1)   At the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for the San
Bernardino area, for the specific type of work performed, as determined and
published by the Director of the State Department of Industrial Relations
pursuant to the Cal. Labor Code, §§ 1770 et seq.; and
      (2)   If no such general prevailing rate has been determined and
published, then a cost per hour for general maintenance and a cost per hour for
skilled labor as established by resolution of the Mayor and City Council.
Notwithstanding the above, a landlord may receive greater or lesser
compensation for self-labor if the landlord proves by clear and convincing
evidence that the amounts set forth above are substantially unfair in a given
case. Owner performed labor in excess of 5% of gross income shall not be
allowed unless the landlord proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that such
excess labor expenses resulted in proportionately greater services for the
benefit of tenants.
   (G)   License and registration fees required by law to the extent same are
not otherwise paid by tenants;
   (H)   The yearly amortized portion of capital expenses, including financing
costs, computed in accordance with any useful life table utilized by the
Internal Revenue Service; and
   (I)   Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred as normal and reasonable
costs of doing business, including, but not limited to, good faith attempts to
recover rents owing and good faith unlawful detainer actions not in derogation
of applicable law, to the extent same are not recovered from tenants.

§ 8.90.200 OPERATING EXPENSES NOT ALLOWABLE.
   Operating expenses shall not include the following:
   (A)   Avoidable and unreasonable or unnecessary expenses;
   (B)   Mortgage principal and interest payments;
   (C)   Lease purchase payments and rent or lease payments to landlord’s
lessor;
   (D)   Penalties, fees or interest assessed or awarded for violation of this
or any other statute;
   (E)   Attorney’s fees and other costs incurred for proceedings before the
hearing officer or in preparation for such proceedings, or in connection with
any civil actions or proceedings against the city, or a decision, ruling or
order of the hearing officer;
   (F)   Depreciation of the real property; and
   (G)   Any expenses for which the landlord has been reimbursed by any
security deposit, insurance settlement, judgment for damages, settlement or any
other method.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.210 PRESUMPTION OF FAIR BASE YEAR NET OPERATING INCOME.
   Except as provided in §
8.90.220, it shall be presumed that the net operating income produced by a park
owner during the base year, provided a fair return on property. Owners shall be
entitled to maintain and increase their net operating income from year to year
in accordance with §§
8.90.080 and 8.90.100(B).
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.220 REBUTTING THE PRESUMPTION.
   (A)   It may be determined that the base year net operating income yielded
other than a fair return on property, in which case, the base year net
operating income may be adjusted accordingly.
   (B)   In order to make such a determination, the hearing officer must make
at least one of the following findings.
      (1)   (a)   The owner’s operating and maintenance expenses in the base
year were unusually
high or low in comparison to other years. In such instances, adjustments may be
made in calculating such expenses so the base year operating expenses reflect
average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time.
         (b)   The hearing officer shall consider the following factors:
            1.   The owners made substantial capital improvements during 1988
which were not reflected in the rent levels on the base date;
            2.   Substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by natural
disaster or vandalism which management has taken appropriate action to reduce;
            3.   Maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to
cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services; and
            4.   Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding
the following of prudent business measures.
      (2)   The rental rates on the base date were disproportionate due to
enumerated factors below. In such instances, adjustments may be made in
calculating gross rents consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
         (a)   The rental rates on the base date were substantially higher or
lower than in preceding months by reason of premiums being charged or rebates
being given for reasons unique to particular units or limited to the period
determining the base rent.
         (b)   The rent on the base date was substantially higher or lower than
at other times of the year by reason of seasonal demand or seasonal variations
in rent.
         (c)   The rental rates on the base date were exceptionally high or low
due to other factors which would cause the application of the base year net
operating income to result in gross inequity to either the owner or tenant.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.230 DETERMINATION OF BASE YEAR NET OPERATING INCOME.
   (A)   To determine the net operating income during the base year, there
shall be deducted from the annualized gross income being realized in 1988, a
sum equal to the actual operating expenses for calendar year 1988, unless the
owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the hearing officer that the use of
some other consecutive 12-month period is justified by reasons consistent with
the purposes of this section.
   (B)   In the event the owner did not own the subject property during the
base year, the operating expenses for 1988 shall be determined by one of the
following methods whichever the hearing officer determines to be more reliable
in the particular case:
      (1)   The previous owner’s actual operating expenses, as defined in §
8.90.190, if such figures were available; or
      (2)   Actual operating expenses for the first calendar year of ownership,
discounted to 1988 by the schedule.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.240 DETERMINATION OF CURRENT YEAR NET OPERATING INCOME.
   To determine the current year net operating income, there shall be deducted
from the annualized gross income, determined by analyzing the monthly rents in
effect at the time of filing of a petition, a sum equal to the actual operating
expenses for the last calendar year (unless the owner demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the hearing officer that the use of some other consecutive 12-
month period is justified by reasons consistent with the purposes of this
section).
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.250 SCHEDULE OF INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES.
   Where scheduling of rental increases, or other calculations, requires
projections of income and expenses, it shall be assumed that operating
expenses, exclusive of property taxes and management expenses, increases at 5%
per year, that property taxes increase at 2% per year and that management
expenses constitute 5% of gross income; provided, however, that if actual
increases are greater or less than those listed in this section, the actual
increases shown according to proof shall be the increases applicable.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
 
§ 8.90.260 ALLOWABLE RENT ADJUSTMENTS.
   The hearing officer may permit rent adjustments, unless otherwise prescribed
by law, such that the owner’s net operating income will be adjusted at the rate
as specified in §
8.90.100(B)(2).
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.270 DISCRETIONARY CONSIDERATIONS.
   While the net operating income formula should operate to guarantee a park
owner a fair return on investment, the hearing officer considering a request
for rent increases shall consider all relevant factors presented in making a
determination, as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.280 LIMIT ON INCREASES PENDING HEARING OR LITIGATION.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no adjustment in rents
in a mobile home park shall be valid during the time that any hearing or
proceeding is being conducted pursuant to this chapter, nor shall such increase
be valid during the period in which the hearing officer’s decision for that
park is being reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction, except those the
tenants shall be required to pay as the permissible adjustment as provided for
under §
8.90.090(B).
(Ord. MC-865, passed 3-24-1993; Ord. MC-1481, passed 4-14-2018)
§ 8.90.290 RENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR REDUCTION IN SERVICES.
   (A)   No owner shall reduce the level or kind of services provided to
tenants as of the date of adoption of this chapter or take any other punitive
action in retaliation for the exercise by tenants of any of the rights granted
by this chapter.
   (B)   If a mobile home park provides in the rent, without separate charge,
utilities or similar services (including, but not limited to, natural gas,
electricity, water, sewer, trash and cable television) and converts to separate
charge for such service by separate metering, separate charge or other lawful
means of transferring to the tenant the obligation for payment for such
services, the cost savings shall be passed through to tenants by a rent
adjustment equal to the actual cost to the park of such transferred utility or
similar service (less common area usage, based on costs for the 12-month period
prior to notice to the tenants of the change). Provided compliance with this
section occurs, provisions for mediation and/or hearing shall not apply. It is
the intent of this section for those rental agreements entered into on or after
January 1, 1991 to be consistent with the provisions of Cal. Civil Code, §
798.41, as adopted by Chapter 1013, § 2 of the Statutes of 1990.
   (C)   For purposes of division (A) above, in determining cost savings to be
passed on to tenants in the form of decreased rent, the cost of installation of
separate utility meters or similar costs incurred by the owner to shift the
obligation for payment of utility costs to the tenants shall not be considered.
However, this shall not be construed to prohibit or prevent the consideration
of inclusion of such costs as an increased operating expense at mediation or
arbitration.
   (D)   If a service other than a utility or similar service per division (A)
above is reduced or eliminated, or if a utility or similar service is reduced
or eliminated without a concomitant decrease in rent, the provisions of this
chapter regarding petition and/or hearing shall apply subject to the following
conditions. Any petition initiating mediation or hearing must be filed within
12 months of the date on which the service was reduced or eliminated, and the
reduction or elimination in services must continue to exist at the time of the
hearing. Rent adjustments shall only be granted prospectively.

in violation of any provision of this chapter shall be liable in a civil action
to the person from whom such payment is demanded, accepted or retained for
damages in the sum of three times the amount by which the payment or payments
demanded, accepted or retained exceed the maximum rent which could lawfully be
demanded, accepted or retained, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and
costs as determined by the court.
   (B)   Criminal remedies. It shall be unlawful for an owner to adjust any
rent in an amount in excess of that allowed under this chapter or by order of
the hearing officer. Any owner who willfully and knowingly violates any of the
provisions of this chapter or the orders of the hearing officer shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor.
   (C)   Injunctive and other civil relief. The City Manager, the city and the
tenants and owners may seek relief from the appropriate court in the
jurisdiction within which the rental unit is located to enforce any provision
of this chapter or its implementing regulations or to restrain or enjoin any
violation of this chapter and of the rules, regulations, orders and decisions
of the hearing officer.
   (D)   Non-waiver of rights. Any waiver or purported waiver by a tenant of
rights granted under this chapter prior to the time when such rights may be

   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the good health and well-being of
the residents of the city from the documented negative effects of secondhand
cannabis smoke. Smoke-free air is an important component of a healthy
community. The Mayor and City Council intend to protect the public health,
safety and welfare by providing a secondhand cannabis smoke-free environment in
public and private places where non-cannabis smokers may be exposed to
secondhand cannabis smoke. The Mayor and City Council further intend to promote
secondhand cannabis smoke-free air, recognizing the need to breathe smoke-free
air has a priority over the desire to smoke cannabis. This chapter is not
intended to interfere with a patient’s right to use medicinal cannabis pursuant
to state law, as may be amended, nor does it criminalize cannabis possession or
use otherwise authorized by state law.

constitutes:
         (a)   Intrusion into a private place, conversation or matter; and

§ 9.92.010 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The Mayor and City Council finds that there is a need for an alternate
method of enforcement for minor violations of the municipal code and applicable
state codes. An appropriate method of enforcement for minor violations is an
administrative citation program as authorized by Cal. Gov’t Code, § 53069.4.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.030 USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION.
   Whenever an enforcement officer determines that a violation subject to this
chapter has occurred, the officer may issue an administrative citation imposing
fines or penalties to any responsible person in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter. Use of an administrative citation is authorized
by this chapter for any violation of the municipal code.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.040 VIOLATION; AUTHORITY; FINES.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of the municipal code may be issued
an administrative citation by a code enforcement officer, or other authorized
officer, as provided in this title.
   (B)   Each and every day a violation of any provision of the municipal code
exists constitutes a separate and distinct offense. Each section of the
municipal code violated constitutes a separate and distinct violation.
   (C)   Any fine assessed by means of an administrative citation issued by the
enforcement officer shall be payable directly to the city or its authorized
vendor for receipt of payment.
   (D)   Any person who receives an administrative citation shall be required
to pay a fine in the following amounts unless otherwise established in the
municipal code or established by resolution of the Mayor and City Council:
      (1)   A fine not exceeding $100 for the first administrative citation;
      (2)   A fine not exceeding $200 for a second administrative citation for
violation of the same ordinance if issued within a 12-month period; and
      (3)   A fine not exceeding $500 for any subsequent administrative
citation issued for violation of the same ordinance within a 12-month period.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.050 SERVICE PROCEDURES.
   In any case where an administrative citation is issued, service of the
citation shall be made by complying with the following.
   (A)   Personal service. The code enforcement officer shall attempt to locate
and personally serve the responsible party and obtain the signature of the
responsible party on the administrative citation. If the responsible person
refuses or fails to sign the administrative citation, the refusal to sign shall
not affect the validity of the administrative citation or of subsequent
proceedings.
   (B)   Mail. If the enforcement officer is unable to locate the responsible
party, responsible party shall be served by United States mail, addressed to
the person to be notified. Service by mail shall be effective on the date of
deposit in the mail.
   (C)   Posting. The enforcement officer may post the notice conspicuously on
or in front of the property or the affected unit; provided, however, that a
citation issued to an owner of real property must also be mailed to the owner
of the property as shown on the last equalized county assessment roll.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.060 CONTENTS OF CITATION.
   (A)   Each administrative citation shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The name of the responsible party and known mailing address;
      (2)   Date, approximate time and address or definite description of the
location where the violation(s) was/were observed;
      (3)   The code section(s) violated and a description of the violation(s);
      (4)   The amount of fine for the violation(s);
      (5)   An explanation of how the fine shall be paid and the time period by
which it shall be paid;
      (6)   Identification of rights to a hearing, including the time within
which the hearing may be requested; and
      (7)   The name and signature of the code enforcement officer, or other
authorized officer, issuing the citation.
   (B)   If the violation is one which is continuing, an order to correct the
violation and an explanation of consequences for failing to correct the
violation shall be issued concurrently with the citation. Failure to issue the
order to correct or explanation of consequences for failure to correct
violations shall not affect the validity of the administrative citation or of
subsequent proceedings.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.070 SATISFACTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a citation, the responsible person must:
      (1)   Pay the fine to the city within 15 days from the issue date of the
administrative citation; or
      (2)   File a request for hearing pursuant to §
9.92.080.
   (B)   Payment of a fine shall not excuse or discharge the failure to correct
the violation(s) nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the city.
Payment of the fine waives the responsible party’s right to the administrative
citation hearing and appeal process.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.080 REQUEST FOR HEARING ON AN ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION.
   (A)   How to file a proper and timely request for hearing. Any recipient of
an administrative citation may contest the citation by completing a request for
hearing form and returning it to the City Clerk within 15 days from the date
the citation is served or deemed to have been served. A failure to file a
timely request for hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing
on the citation and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Proper filing
of a request for hearing must also include payment to the City Clerk of the
appeal fee as established or amended from time to time by resolution of the
Mayor and City Council.
   (B)   Selection of hearing officer. The City Manager shall select a
qualified person to serve as administrative hearing officer to preside over
hearings under this chapter. Hearing officers must be selected in a manner that
avoids the potential for pecuniary or other bias. For purposes of this section,
QUALIFIED PERSON includes an individual with a background in the practice of
law or with a background in local governance, that is particularly experienced
or knowledgeable about the subject matter at issue or that is otherwise deemed
qualified by the City Manager.
   (C)   Hearing procedure.
      (1)   No hearing to contest an administrative citation before the
administrative hearing officer shall be held unless and until a request for
hearing form has been completed and submitted to the City Clerk’s office.
      (2)   After receipt of the request for hearing form, a hearing before the
administrative hearing officer shall be set for a date that is not less than 15
days and not more than 60 days from the date that the request for hearing is
filed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, unless the parties
waive such time limits. The failure to hold the hearing within this time period
does not invalidate any action of the administrative hearing officer. The
appellant shall be notified of the time and place set for the hearing at least
ten calendar days prior to the date of hearing.
      (3)   At the hearing, the administrative hearing officer must hear and
consider the testimony of the appellant, respondent and their witnesses, as
well as any documentary evidence presented by these persons. The administrative
hearing officer must ensure that parties receive a fair hearing and are
afforded due process in accordance with the applicable state and federal law
governing such hearings.
      (4)   The responsible party may bring an interpreter to the hearing at
his or her sole expense. The city may, at its discretion, record the hearing by
stenographer, court reporter, audio recording or video recording.
      (5)   The appellant shall be given the opportunity to testify and present
evidence concerning the administrative citation. Each party shall have the
opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and present relevant evidence in support
of that party’s case.
      (6)   Administrative hearings are intended to be informal in nature. The
formal rules of evidence shall not apply. Other than copies of citations,
notices, orders and inspection reports served on the responsible parties as
part of the enforcement action giving rise to the hearing, no pre-hearing
discovery is required.
   (D)   Proof. The city bears the burden of proof at an administrative hearing
to establish the existence of a violation of the municipal code and the
responsible party’s responsibility for such violation. The administrative
citation and any additional documents submitted by the enforcement officer
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the respective facts contained in
those documents. The standard of proof to be used by the administrative hearing
officer in deciding the issues at an administrative hearing is by a
preponderance of the evidence.
   (E)   Continuance. The administrative hearing officer, before or during a
hearing, may grant a request for a continuance, in his or her discretion, for
good cause; however, in no event may the hearing be continued for more than 30
calendar days without stipulation by all parties.
   (F)   Failure to appear. Any person who has filed a “request for hearing”
form and has been notified of the time and date for a hearing pursuant to this
chapter who does not appear at said hearing shall be deemed to have waived the
right to be present at the hearing and the hearing shall proceed in his or her
absence.
   (G)   Administrative hearing officer’s decision. After considering all of
the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the administrative hearing
officer must issue a written decision within 30 business days of the hearing.
Failure of the administrative hearing officer to render a decision within this
time period does not invalidate any action of the administrative hearing
officer. The decision shall include the reasons for the decision, any
conditions pertaining to the correction of the violation(s) and any time limits
set for said corrections.
      (1)   The administrative hearing officer’s decision must contain the
following statement: “The decision of the hearing officer is final and binding.
Judicial review of this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits
set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6 et seq.”
      (2)   The administrative hearing order must be served on all parties by
mail. The effective date of the decision shall be the mailing date of the
written decision to the applicant.
      (3)   If the hearing officer determines the administrative citation
should be upheld, then any fine amount on deposit with the city shall be
retained by the city. If the hearing officer determines the administrative
citation should be canceled and the fine was deposited with the city, then the
city shall refund the amount of the deposited fine.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.090 FAILURE TO PAY FINES.
   (A)   Any person who fails to pay to the city any fine imposed pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter on or before the date that fine is due is liable
for the payment of any applicable interest charges.
   (B)   The delinquent obligation shall bear interest at a rate of 10% per
year. Interest shall be calculated on a prorated monthly basis from the date
such obligation becomes delinquent to the date it is paid.
   (C)   The city may collect any delinquent administrative citation fines or
interest charges by use of all available legal means, including personal
collection from the responsible parties.
   (D)   The city also may recover all administrative costs, expenses and fees,
including attorneys’ fees, associated with the assessment, enforcement,
processing and collection of the fines associated with the administrative
citation in accordance with the provisions of this code.

administrative hearing officer to conduct administrative hearings in accordance

code or ordinance violations through the use of any other administrative
procedure or court proceeding.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.170 APPLICABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of the ordinances of the city or

instituting an administrative adjudication hearing with the administrative
hearing officer as provided in this article.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provision of the ordinances of the city or
this code, any enforcement action, including, but not limited to, license or
permit suspension or revocation, which may be exercised by another department
of the city may also be exercised by the administrative hearing officer as
provided in this article.
(Ord. MC-1521, passed 9-18-2019; Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.92.180 RIGHT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   Any decision of the administrative hearing officer is final, subject to
judicial review. Within 20 days after service of the decision of the
administrative hearing officer upon the party to the administrative
adjudication hearing, that person may seek judicial review of the decision by
filing an appeal with the Superior Court of the State of California, in the
County of San Bernardino, in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code, § 53069.4. The
appealing party must serve upon the City Clerk, either in person or by first
class mail, a copy of the notice of appeal. If the appealing party fails to
timely file a notice of appeal, the hearing officer’s decision is deemed
confirmed.

§ 9.93.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Mayor and City Council have determined that the enforcement of the
municipal code throughout the city is an important public service and is vital
to the protection of the public’s health, safety and quality of life. The Mayor
and City Council have determined a need for alternative methods of code
enforcement and that a comprehensive code enforcement system uses a combination
of judicial and administrative remedies to gain compliance with code
regulations. The Mayor and City Council find a need to draft precise
regulations that can be effectively applied in judicial and administrative
proceedings and further finds that there is a need to establish uniform
procedures for the proper application of administrative code enforcement
remedies and administrative hearings to resolve administrative code enforcement
cases and appeals.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)

process and until compliance is achieved, including, but not limited to, staff
time in investigating the violation, inspecting the property where the
violation occurred, preparing investigation reports, sending notices, preparing
for and attending any appeal hearing, attorneys’ fees and fees paid to the
administrative hearing officer. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS shall not mean the
administrative civil penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter.
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS shall not mean late payment charges that accrue, or
collection costs incurred, as a result of unpaid administrative civil
penalties.
   ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICER. Any person assigned by the City Manager to
preside at administrative hearings.
   CITY MANAGER. The San Bernardino City Manager, or his or her designee
   ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. Any code enforcement officer or other city employee or

business entity.
   RESPONSIBLE PARTY. Includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:
      (1)   A person who causes a code violation to occur;
      (2)   A person who maintains or allows a code violation to continue, by
his or her action or failure to act;
      (3)   A person whose agent, employee or independent contractor causes a
code violation by his or her action or failure to act;

governing such hearings.
      (2)   The administrative hearing officer shall only consider evidence
that is relevant to the following issues:

part of the enforcement action giving rise to the hearing, no pre-hearing
discovery is required.
   (B)   The city bears the burden of proof at an administrative hearing to
establish the existence of a violation of the municipal code and the

citation and any additional documents submitted by the enforcement officer

those documents.
   (C)   The standard of proof to be used by the administrative hearing officer
in deciding the issues at an administrative hearing is by a preponderance of
the evidence.
   (D)   Each party shall have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and
present relevant evidence in support of that party’s case.

related to the hearing, and shall be deemed to have failed to exhaust his or
her administrative remedies; provided that proper notice of the hearing as
required by this chapter has been provided.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)

administrative hearing order which affirms or rejects the administrative civil
penalties notice and order or which modifies the daily rate or duration of the
administrative civil penalties depending upon the review of the evidence and
application of the criteria in §
9.93.040. Failure of the administrative hearing officer to render a decision
within this time period does not invalidate any action of the administrative
hearing officer. The administrative hearing officer’s decision must be in
writing and must set forth the administrative hearing officer’s findings of
fact and conclusions of law. The administrative hearing officer may increase or
decrease the total amount of civil penalties and costs that were assessed by
the administrative civil penalties notice and order upon a showing of good
cause and in consideration of the factors listed in §
9.93.040.
   (B)   The administrative hearing officer may issue an administrative hearing
order that requires the responsible party to cease from violating the municipal
code and to make necessary corrections.
   (C)   As part of the administrative hearing order, the administrative
hearing officer may establish specific deadlines for the payment of civil
penalties and costs and condition the total or partial assessment of
administrative civil penalties on the responsible party’s compliance by
specified deadlines.
   (D)   The administrative hearing officer may issue an administrative hearing
order which imposes additional administrative civil penalties that will
continue to be assessed until the responsible party complies with the
administrative hearing officer’s decision and corrects the violation.
   (E)   The administrative hearing officer may schedule subsequent review
hearings as may be necessary or as requested by a party to the hearing to
ensure compliance with the administrative hearing order.
   (F)   The administrative hearing order shall be served on all parties by any
one of the methods listed in §
9.93.035.
   (G)   The administrative hearing order must contain the following statement:
“The decision of the hearing officer is final and binding. Judicial review of
this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits set forth in
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6 et seq.” The administrative
hearing order shall become final on the date of service of the order, unless
any party files a written request for reconsideration or modification with the
City Manager within 15 days after the date of service of the order.
   (H)   A request for reconsideration or modification of an administrative
hearing order may only be based upon an error of law or new evidence not
available to the requesting party at the time of the administrative hearing.
The decision of the administrative hearing officer on the request for
reconsideration or modification shall become final on the date of service of
the decision by any one of the methods listed in §
9.93.035.

officer may use all appropriate legal means to recover the administrative civil
penalties and administrative costs and obtain compliance with the
administrative hearing order.
   (B)   After the administrative hearing officer issues an administrative
hearing order, the enforcement officer shall monitor the violations and
determine compliance.
   (C)   It is unlawful for a party to an administrative hearing, who has been
served with a copy of the final administration hearing order pursuant to this
chapter, to fail to comply with the order. Failure to comply with a final
administrative hearing order, except for non-payment of administrative civil
penalties, may be prosecuted as an infraction or misdemeanor at the discretion
of the City Attorney.
(Ord. MC-1553, passed 2-17-2021)
§ 9.93.160 JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   (A)   The decision of the administrative hearing officer shall be final and
conclusive and shall not be subject to appeal to the Mayor and City Council.

the time in which judicial review of the order must be sought shall be governed
by Cal. Code of Civil Procedure, § 1094.6 or other applicable state law.

Environmental Quality Act, pursuant to § 15061(b)(3) of the Guidelines for

of Regulations, commencing with § 15000), as it can be seen with certainty that
there is no possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
environment.
(Ord. MC-1268, passed 4-22-2008)
§ 9.93.200 ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION PROCEDURES NOT EXCLUSIVE.

(Ord. MC-1521, passed 9-18-2019)
§ 9.94.070 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS - NOTICE PROCEDURES.
   Except where this code prescribes another procedure, the following hearing
notice procedures apply to appeals under this chapter.
   (A)   No hearing before a hearing officer under this chapter may be

9.94.060.
   (B)   The City Clerk must schedule the hearing no sooner than 15 days and no
later than 60 days from receipt of the notice of appeal, unless the parties

does not invalidate any action of the hearing officer.
   (C)   The City Clerk must provide a copy of the appeal to the respondent
within five days after filing.
   (D)   The City Clerk must notify the appellant, respondent and City Attorney
in writing of the date, time and location of the hearing at least 15 days
before the date of the hearing.
   (E)   Failure to receive notice of the time and place of the hearing shall

officer, if the notice was given in the manner stated in division (D) above.
   (F)   The notice of hearing may be served by any of the methods of service
listed in §
9.94.100.
   (G)   Unless the notice of appeal names some other respondent, the
administrative officer or administrative agency that took the action or made
the decision being appealed is designated the “respondent.”
(Ord. MC-1521, passed 9-18-2019)
§ 9.94.080 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS - CONDUCT OF HEARING.
   (A)   Participation. The hearing officer must be present at all times to
preside over the hearing. All hearings are open to the public. The respondent,
or another city representative, is required to participate in the hearing. The
appellant is required to participate in the hearing.
   (B)   Evidence, witnesses and discovery. All parties have the right to
present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. The formal rules of evidence and
discovery do not apply. The rules of privilege are effective to the same extent
that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil actions. Irrelevant
and unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded. Oral evidence may be taken
only on oath or affirmation. The appellant and respondent may represent
themselves or be represented by anyone of their choice.
   (C)   Cross-examination. No party shall have the right to cross-examine any
other party or witness except for good cause shown to the satisfaction of the
hearing officer. Each party may cross-examine witnesses.
   (D)   Interpretation and recordation. The appellant may bring an interpreter
to the hearing at his or her sole expense. The city may, at its discretion,
record the hearing by stenographer, court reporter, audio recording or video
recording.
   (E)   Subpoenas. In any hearing conducted by the hearing officer, he or she
has the power to compel the attendance of witnesses for the production of
evidence by subpoenas issued under the authority of the City Council and
attested by the City Clerk. Subpoenas may also be issued at the request of the
parties prior to the commencement of such hearing. No subpoena may be issued
for any reason without the concurrence of the City Attorney that there is good
cause for such subpoena to be issued and such subpoena is approved by the City
Council. It is the duty of the Chief of Police to cause all such subpoenas to
be served, and the refusal of a person to attend or to testify in answer to
such a subpoena subjects the person to prosecution in the same manner set forth
by law for failure to appear before the City Council in response to a subpoena
issued by the City Council.
   (F)   Proof. The standard of proof applicable to the hearing and to be used
by the hearing officer in deciding the issue on appeal is proof by a
preponderance of the evidence. The respondent bears the burden of proof at the
hearing. The hearing officer determines relevancy, weight and credibility of
testimony and evidence.
   (G)   Continuances. The hearing officer, before or during a hearing, may
grant a request for a continuance, in his or her discretion, for good cause;
however, in no event may the hearing be continued for more than 30 calendar
days without stipulation by all parties.
   (H)   Failure of appellant to appear. If the appellant fails to appear at
the hearing, the hearing officer may cancel the hearing and send a notice
thereof to the appellant to the address stated on the appeal form. A
cancellation of a hearing due to non-appearance of the appellant waives the
right to appeal and is failure to exhaust all administrative remedies; provided
that proper notice of the hearing as required by this chapter has been
provided. In such instances, the action is final and binding.
(Ord. MC-1521, passed 9-18-2019)
§ 9.94.090 DECISION OF THE HEARING OFFICER.
   (A)   The hearing officer must render his or her decision in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter, applicable law and all ordinances of this city.
   (B)   The hearing officer’s decision must be in writing and must set forth
the hearing officer’s findings of fact and conclusions of law.
   (C)   The hearing officer must render a decision within 15 days following
the conclusion of the hearing. Failure of the hearing officer to render a
decision within this time period does not invalidate any action of the hearing
officer.
   (D)   The hearing officer’s decision must be served on all parties in
accordance with §
9.94.100. Failure of a person to receive a properly-served decision does not
affect the finality or effectiveness of the decision.
   (E)   The hearing officer’s decision is the final administrative decision of
the city regarding the action that is the subject of the appeal. The hearing
officer’s decision is effective on the date of service of the decision. The
decision must contain the following statement: “The decision of the hearing
officer is final and binding. Judicial review of this decision is subject to
the provisions and time limits set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure

premises. On the breach of any provision of this lease by lessee, lessor may,
at lessor’s option, terminate this lease immediately and reenter and repossess

the landlord may file a written appeal of the determination of violation with
the City Clerk who shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before the

landlord is required to serve and diligently prosecute either a three-day
notice to quit or a 30-day notice to vacate. The required notice shall also
state that within 15 days of the date of the notice, the tenant(s) may file a
written appeal of the determination of violation with the City Clerk who shall
cause the matter to be set for hearing before the hearing officer. Written
notice of the date and time of said hearing shall be served by first class
mail, addressed to the tenant(s) last known address. A decision affirming the
violation by the hearing officer shall not prevent such tenant(s) from
defending any subsequent unlawful detainer action.

be rendered or declared invalid by any final court action in a court of

remaining provisions, sections, paragraphs, sentences and words of this chapter
shall remain in full force and effect.

9.97.020   Definition
   
9.97.030   Prohibitions
Editor’s note:
   Ord. MC-1415, passed 7-20-2015 added “Chapter 9.97 Psychoactive Bath Salts,
Psychoactive Herbal Incense and Other Synthetic Drugs” in such a way that might
have supplanted “Chapter 9.97 Regulation of Registered Sex Offenders,” which
was not the intention of the Mayor and City Council. On advice from the City
Attorney, Chapter 9.97 remains “Regulation of Registered Sex Offenders” and
“Psychoactive Bath Salts, Psychoactive Herbal Incense and Other Synthetic
Drugs” has been moved to
Chapter 9.98. This non-substantive change of chapter number is the only change
from Ord. MC-1415.
§ 9.97.010 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Mayor and City Council desire to impose safety precautions in
furtherance of the compelling interest of protecting children from registered
sex offenders by restricting registered sex offenders’ access to locations
where children regularly gather. The Mayor and City Council find that
registered sex offenders pose a clear threat to the children residing in or
visiting the community. It is the intent of the restrictions in this chapter to
reduce the threat that registered sex offenders pose to these children by
limiting the ability of registered sex offenders to be in contact with these
children on Halloween, the evening of October 31.
   (B)   Currently, state law does not address the areas that registered sex
offenders can frequent, focusing only on where registered sex offenders can
reside. This chapter is not intended to conflict with, but to supplement, state
law by imposing additional restrictions on the locations where registered sex
offenders may reside, imposing restrictions on the locations where registered
sex offenders may frequent and imposing reasonable time, place and manner
restrictions on registered sex offenders’ contact with children.
(Ord. MC-1380, passed 10-17-2012)
§ 9.97.020 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. Any person who has been convicted of an offense
against a child and is required to register as a sex offender, pursuant to the
Cal. Penal Code, §§ 290 et seq.
(Ord. MC-1380, passed 10-17-2012)
§ 9.97.030 PROHIBITIONS.
   Any registered sex offender on October 31 of each year shall:
   (A)   Leave all exterior residential, decorative and ornamental lighting at
his or her residence off between 5:00 p.m. and 11:59 p.m.;
   (B)   Not decorate or maintain any Halloween decorations on the exterior or
any interior portion of his or her residence that is visible to the public; and
   (C)   Be prohibited from answering the door of his or her residence to
children who are engaging in the practice of asking for treats on Halloween,
commonly called “trick-or-treating.”

Editor’s note:
   Ord. MC-1415, passed 7-20-2015 added “Chapter 9.97 Psychoactive Bath Salts,
Psychoactive Herbal Incense and Other Synthetic Drugs” in such a way that might
have supplanted “Chapter 9.97 Regulation of Registered Sex Offenders,” which
was not the intention of the Mayor and City Council. On advice from the City
Attorney, Chapter 9.97 remains “Regulation of Registered Sex Offenders” and
“Psychoactive Bath Salts, Psychoactive Herbal Incense and Other Synthetic
Drugs” has been moved to
Chapter 9.98. This non-substantive change of chapter number is the only change
from Ord. MC-1415.
§ 9.98.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   Recreational use of psychoactive bath salts, psychoactive herbal incense and
similar products commonly known as “synthetic drugs” has been documented to
cause hallucinations, agitation, psychosis, aggression, suicidal and homicidal
ideation, cannibalism and death. While state and federal laws and regulations
prohibit some synthetic drugs, the makers of these drugs continually alter the
composition of the compounds in their products so as to escape the purview of
these laws and regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to
provide the city with reasonable measures to address the dangers to the
community posed by synthetic drugs that are not regulated by state or federal
law.

then known, determines that a violation of this chapter presents an imminent
danger or hazard or is imminently injurious to the public health or safety,
then that violation is punishable by the summary abatement.

Editor’s note:
   This chapter is added by Ord. MC-1407, passed 9-15-2014.
§ 10.25.010 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds as follows.
   (A)   Persons and businesses are using city streets as de facto used car
lots to sell used vehicles.
   (B)   The act of selling a car in public streets invites prospective buyers
into the roadway to examine the vehicle. It is well known that prospective
buyers examine the condition of vehicles for sale and look for evidence of
damage or repairs. When done in the public roadway, this poses an obvious risk
to public and traffic safety that the city wishes to avoid.
   (C)   The parking of vehicles for sale on city streets creates a distraction
for drivers and pedestrians, thereby creating a further public safety hazard.
Because drivers may attempt to not only read a for sale sign in or on a vehicle
but also commit to memory, write down or call a telephone number on such a
sign, these signs pose a greater risk of accidents than do other types of signs
that may be displayed in or on a parked vehicle.
   (D)   The significant increase in vehicles parked for the purpose of sale
has created a nuisance by decreasing the parking available for local residents
and businesses.
   (E)   The city has an important and substantial public interest in
protecting public safety; reducing accidents; removing impediments to the
orderly flow of traffic, such as illegal and hazardous parking; abating public
nuisances; eliminating visual blight; preventing unlawful trafficking in stolen
vehicles; and protecting licensed car dealers from unfair competition.
(Ord. MC-1407, passed 9-15-2014)

§ 12.03.010 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Increasing public demand for services has prompted the expansion and
installation of new above and below ground facilities offered throughout the
city street and public right-of-way system.
   (B)   Increased usage of the public right-of-way has created congestion both
above and below ground and created competition for the available space.
   (C)   Congestion in the underground portions of the street right-of-way has
created conflicts between the various users in that the first users take the
available space leaving little or no room for other users. In some cases, the
city is prevented from installing needed expansions to water lines, sewers or
storm drains due to other users taking planned space for their own facilities.
   (D)   Continued use of public right-of-way has caused the degradation of
existing pavements and in some cases has been the cause of damage or
degradation to recently constructed or rehabilitated pavements, traffic signal
loops and pavement markings.
   (E)   It is the intent of the city to preserve its right to install
expansions to its own systems, protect investments in capital street
improvements and prevent overuse of the public right-of-way that would hamper
proper maintenance and operations of facilities.
   (F)   Continued excavations and encroachments into the public right-of-way
disrupt the traveling public as well as the business operators and pose
potential safety hazards unless controlled by permit and properly inspected.
   (G)   A public utility franchise, granted by the state or the city is a
contract granting special privileges to use public rights-of-way. It is not
intended that this chapter impose additional rules and regulations upon the
public utilities or confer authority to the city that conflicts with rights
granted by existing franchise agreements, the California Public Utilities Code
or jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission.

Engineer.
(Ord. MC-1004, passed 10-21-1997; Ord. MC-1027, passed 9-9-1998)
§ 12.03.040 POWER TO REGULATE.
   (A)   The city shall adopt such regulations for the location, size, depth,
number of facilities to be accommodated, installation and repair methods and
surcharges for new or recently rehabilitated public streets that may require
excavations as it may deem necessary for public welfare. The regulations are
intended to protect the public right-of-way and equitably allocate available
space. In the event a utility cannot locate as directed by the city without
violation of PUC installation guidelines, then alternate alignments shall be
selected.
   (B)   Whenever an excavation is made by tunneling under the surface of the
street, the city shall adopt such regulations and require such inspections, as
it may deem necessary to ensure full compliance with the other sections of this
chapter.
   (C)   Whenever conduits are placed under city streets or in public rights-
of-way, the city will require the owner/user to ensure the conduits can be
located, with accuracy, by a reliable method. This shall mean a horizontal
location within four inches and depth within 18 inches.
   (D)   Plans shall be prepared and submitted that show the location, depth
and type of proposed facilities, as well as other existing underground
utilities. Such plans shall be to scale and no less than one inch equals 60
feet and shall show the right-of-way line, curb lines and all known underground
utilities, conduits or buried wires.
   (E)   City direction to relocate or locate in other positions to clear
existing or future facilities will be considered mandatory and not merely
recommendations. Failure to follow approved plans will result in the facility
being relocated as directed at the cost of the owner.
§ 12.03.050 NON-INTERFERENCE WITH FRANCHISE RIGHTS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as interfering with any rights
granted to any persons, firm or corporation under and by virtue of any
franchise of the state or of the city or to any rights granted in the future.
§ 12.03.055 MORATORIUM.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to excavate, cut or open the
pavement surface of any street within five years after acceptance of the street
construction work by the City Engineer, with the exception of seal coated or
micro-surfaced streets, which shall be for a period of three years after
acceptance of the work by the City Engineer. This moratorium on street
excavations shall not apply if the Director of Development Services grants a
street excavation permit for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Excavation work that is mandated by city, county, state or federal
legislation or that is required as a condition of approval to a city issued
development permit;
      (2)   Utility service for development where no other reasonable means of

inspections; or
      (6)   Other situations where the Director of Development Services finds
that the excavation is necessary for the public health, safety or welfare.
   (B)   In the event of an emergency which endangers life or property, or for
an emergency repair or modification which is necessary to prevent interruption
of life essential utility services, excavation work may occur without first
obtaining a permit; however, written application for a permit shall be provided
the following business day.
   (C)   If a permit is granted by the Director of Development Services or
emergency excavation work as hereinabove described is performed, the following
conditions shall apply:
      (1)   All restoration and repair work shall be performed in accordance
with the most current trench, backfill and pavement replacement detail
standards in effect and as approved by the City Engineer;
      (2)   Provide a written pavement life performance warranty in a form
acceptable to the city, unless one is already provided through a franchise
agreement with the city. The warranty shall provide that in the event that
subsurface material or pavement over or within the trench influence area
becomes depressed, broken or otherwise fails at any time after the excavation
(or joint operation excavation) has been completed, that person shall repair or
reconstruct the subsurface and pavement to a condition to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer; and
      (3)   The person requesting the excavation permit or responsible for
emergency excavation work shall submit an application for an excavation permit,
pay all required fees and comply with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   The moratorium on excavations shall not apply in any area where the
street pavement construction was completed five years prior to the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
(Ord. MC-1281, passed 8-19-2008)
§ 12.03.060 PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (A)   Every permit for any excavation or encroachment in or under the
surface of any street shall be granted subject to the rights of this city, or
any other person entitled thereto, to make reasonable use of that part of the
street for any purpose for which the street may be lawfully used, consistent
with the excavation and/or encroachment made pursuant to such permit.
   (B)   It is unlawful to remove material from or engage in construction,
repair or installation of conduits within any street in such a manner as to

provide 24-hour emergency telephone numbers should problems be discovered other
than during normal working hours and shall list the same on the application.
   (I)   The Director of Development Services may issue vehicle parking permits
that allow encroachment into time limited parking areas for extended work
periods. See §
12.03.090.
(Ord. MC-1004, passed 10-21-1997; Ord. MC-1027, passed 9-9-1998)
§ 12.03.070 FEES.
   (A)   Before a right-of-way excavation/ encroachment permit is issued, the
person making the application shall pay the city a non-refundable right-of-way
construction permit fee as established by resolution.
   (B)   (1)   Public utilities approved by the Director of Development
Services may obtain a right-of-way blanket permit for minor work and emergency

§ 12.03.080 RESERVED.
[Reserved]
§ 12.03.090 ENCROACHMENT FOR LANE CLOSURE.
   (A)   Closure of traffic lanes on arterial and collector streets as
designated in the city’s general plan circulation element shall be avoided
between the morning and evening peak hours to accommodate traffic operations.
Generally, the period from 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. constitutes the morning peak
and the period from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. constitutes the evening peak. Peak
flow need only be addressed weekdays (Monday through Friday).
   (B)   Permits shall be required for excavations/encroachments that will
occur at the places and times specified in division (A) above and shall be
assessed an additional fee, as determined by resolution, for each day of the
closure or operation.
   (C)   Emergency closures shall not require an encroachment permit. The
owner/contractor completing the work shall notify the Director of Development
Services immediately by telephone or telecopier or in person of such emergency
closures. As used in this section, EMERGENCY means an actual, threatened or
anticipated incident or situation which seriously threatens the public health
and safety. In the event such emergency closures present a hazard or serious
impact on the traveling public, the owner/contractor shall pay the city actual
costs for traffic control officers, personnel or equipment dispatched to
correct the traffic disruption. These actual costs shall be over and above any
blanket permit, lane closure or after the fact permit issued.
   (D)   All traffic lane closures shall follow the advance warning and safety
signing as required by the “WATCH Manual” or other approved traffic-control
manual. Failure to comply with this section shall constitute sufficient grounds
for the city to issue a stop work order.
   (E)   Projects involving the use of “Rule 20” funds or being done at the
request of the city in relation to other ongoing city projects are exempt from
the provisions of this section.
§ 12.03.100 INSPECTION AND PLAN REVIEW - DEPOSIT.
   (A)   Before excavation/encroachment permits are issued, a deposit to cover
the estimated cost of the inspection, plan review and repair/replacement costs
shall be paid to the city. Franchise holders who have repair/replacement
language within the franchise agreement or who have previously undertaken all
repair/replacement obligations need only provide inspection and plan review
fees. Both inspection and plan review will be charged as a percentage of the
estimated construction cost with a minimum basic fee to cover administrative
costs associated with the permit and plan review/inspections. Public utilities
performing work under a blanket permit, in lieu of providing the inspection and
plan review deposit, shall be billed quarterly for costs based on construction
activities and plan reviews conducted for the public utilities, by the city, in
public rights-of-way and public places.
   (B)   Plan reviews shall be submitted to the Department of Development
Services for review and comment. Two plans shall be submitted and no permits
shall be issued or construction started, until the plan review has been
completed and plans approved.
   (C)   No portion of the deposit for repair/replacement costs shall be
returned until all work has been satisfactorily completed and all markings,
signs, conduits and systems are returned to working order or replaced in kind.
This shall also include the removal of pavement markings made to locate
underground utilities and facilities and used by the contractor for
construction purposes. The street shall be returned to a condition that
reflects no evidence of the construction activities. Depending on the location
of and direction of the excavation, the contractor may be required to pave to
limits of two feet each side of the trench, from the curb to the first lane
line, a full lane width, a full half street section or the entire street
section should the trench be skewed or impact both sides of the street. Surface
treatments, such as chip seal and slurry seal, may be considered based on the
condition of the street and area of the patch.

§ 12.03.110 BONDS, INSURANCE, DEPOSITS.
   (A)   (1)   Except as provided in the Cal. Streets and Highways Code, §
1468, before an excavation/encroachment permit is issued, a deposit in an
amount of the estimated construction cost, as determined by the Director of
Development Services, shall be paid to the city for damages and as indemnity
for any damages, which may be caused by the permitted excavation or
obstruction; or in lieu of such deposit, post security in a form approved by
the City Attorney.
      (2)   Security shall indemnify the city for any damages and shall be
further conditioned upon the compliance by the applicant with all provisions of
this chapter. Such deposit or security shall be for 100% of the estimated
construction cost, as determined by the Director of Development Services, to
guarantee faithful performance of all work, in a manner satisfactory to the
city, and that all materials and workmanship will be free from original or
developed defects. The deposit or security will remain in effect until the end
of all warranty periods set forth in this chapter. Changes in the work or
extensions of time shall in no way release the applicant or surety from its
obligations.
   (B)   (1)   Applicant shall furnish to the city a policy or certificate of
liability insurance in which the city is the named insured or is named as an
additional insured with the applicant. Franchised utilities doing work with
their own forces shall not be required to submit insurance certifications or
policies. Notwithstanding any inconsistent statement in the policy or any
subsequent endorsement, the city shall be the insured or as an additional
insured covering the work whether liability is attributable to the applicant or
the city.
      (2)   The policy shall ensure the city, its officers, employees and
agents, while acting within the scope of their duties on the permit, against
all claims arising out of or in connection with the work. Coverage shall be in
accordance with the current edition of the “Standard Specifications for Public
Works Construction” (Green Book), § 7-3. The applicant shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the city, its officers and agents from all damages, costs or
expenses in law or equity that may, at any time, arise or be set up because of
damages to property, or of personal injury received by reason or in the course
of performing work, which may be caused by any willful or negligent act or
omission by the applicant, or any of the applicant’s employees or contractors.
The city will not be liable for any accident, loss or damage to the work prior
to its completion and acceptance.
      (3)   All liability insurance policies shall bear an endorsement or shall
have attached a rider whereby it is provided that, in the event of expiration
or proposed cancellation of such policies for any reason whatsoever, the city
shall be notified by registered mail, return receipt requested, giving a
sufficient time before the date thereof to comply with any applicable law or
statute, but in no event less than 30 days before expiration or cancellation is
effective.
      (4)   The applicant shall be required, on the permit, to affirm that they
have a certificate of consent to self-insure, or a certificate of workers’
compensation insurance, or a certified copy thereof (Cal. Labor Code, § 3800)
or sign a certificate of exemption from workers’ compensation insurance (work
over $100 valuation). Said certification shall certify the applicant shall not
employ any person in any manner so as to become subject to the Workers’
Compensation Laws of California in the performance of the work. After making
such certification, should the applicant become subject to workers’
compensation provisions of the California Labor Code, applicant must forthwith
comply with the same or the permit shall be deemed revoked.
   (C)   Owner occupants or owner builders shall not be required to provide
said insurance certificates for work with a value under $5,000. Owner occupants
or owner builders shall however be bound by the provisions of division (B)
above as it relates to indemnification and defense of the city and liability
for accident, loss or damage to property or for personal injury. The owner
occupant’s or the owner builder’s signature on the application will attest to
their understanding and acceptance of the liability exposure for work done by
owner occupants or owner builders. Owners or builders shall declare that they
are exempt from the Contractor’s License Law and as the owner of the property
that they or their employees, with wages as their sole compensation, will do
the work and it is not intended or offered for sale. Contractor’s License Law
does not apply to an owner of property who builds or improves thereon and who
does such work themselves or through their own employees; provided that such
improvements are not intended or offered for sale. If, however, the improvement
is sold within one year of completion, the owner or builder will have the
burden of proving that they did not build or improve for the purpose of sale.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, a
contractor who has been awarded a competitive bid by the city for a public
project involving street excavation or cutting shall not be required to file a
bond or special deposit under this section to cover the cost of repairing or
replacement of street surface excavated or damaged; provided that the
contractor’s bid documents or contract require that they perform such street
repair or replacement as a part of the awarded project and that they so perform
in a manner satisfactory to the Director of Development Services and in
accordance with all provisions of this section.
   (E)   An agreement between the Redevelopment Agency and the city in a form
satisfactory to the City Attorney unconditionally providing and guaranteeing
that the agency provide and pay for those excavations/encroachments and other
costs required pursuant to the provisions of this section may be filed with the
Director of Development Services as security in lieu of the bond, cash or
certificate of deposit whenever the excavations/encroachments are located in a
redevelopment project area and the agreement recites that the excavations/
encroachments are in compliance with the redevelopment plan for the area and in
furtherance of the public interest in promoting public or private development.

   (A)   In general. There shall be a type of encroachment permit, entitled a
“wireless encroachment permit,” which shall be subject to all of the same
requirements as an encroachment permit would under Chapter 12.03 in addition to
all of the requirements of this chapter. Unless exempted, every person who
desires to place a wireless facility in the public rights-of-way or modify an
existing wireless facility in the public rights-of-way must obtain a wireless
encroachment permit authorizing the placement or modification in accordance
with this chapter. Except for small cell facilities, facilities qualifying as
eligible facilities requests or any other type of facility expressly allowed in
the public right-of-way by state or federal law, no other wireless facilities
shall be permitted pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Exemptions. This chapter does not apply to:
      (1)   The placement or modification of facilities by the city or by any
other agency of the state solely for public safety purposes; and
      (2)   Installation of a “cell on wheels,” “cell on truck” or a similar
structure for a temporary period in connection with an emergency or event, but
no longer than required for the emergency or event; provided that installation
does not involve excavation, movement or removal of existing facilities.
   (C)   Other applicable requirements. In addition to the wireless
encroachment permit required herein, the placement of a wireless facility in
the ROW requires the persons who will own or control those facilities to obtain
all permits required by applicable law, and to comply with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, applicable law governing radio frequency (“RF”)
emissions.
   (D)   Pre-existing facilities in the ROW. Any wireless facility already
existing in the ROW as of the date of this chapter’s adoption shall remain
subject to the standards and conditions of this code in effect prior to this
chapter, unless and until a renewal of such facility’s then existing permit is
granted, at which time the provisions of this chapter shall apply in full force
going forward as to such facility. The review of any request for a renewal of a
permit for such pre-existing facilities shall be conducted pursuant to this
chapter, rather than the portion(s) of this code that it was previously
reviewed under.
   (E)   Public use. Except as otherwise provided by state law, any use of the
public right-of-way authorized pursuant to this chapter will be subordinate to
the city’s use and use by the public.
(Ord. MC-1560, passed 6-16-2021)
§ 12.05.040 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Reviewing authority. The Director of Public Works (“the Director”), or
his or her designee, is responsible for administering this chapter. As part of
the administration of this chapter, the Director may:
      (1)   Interpret the provisions of this chapter;
      (2)   Develop and implement standards governing the placement and
modification of wireless facilities consistent with the requirements of this
chapter, including regulations governing collocation and resolution of
conflicting applications for placement of wireless facilities;
      (3)   Develop and implement acceptable designs and development standards
for wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way, taking into account the
zoning districts bounding the public rights-of-way;
      (4)   Develop forms and procedures for submission of applications for
placement or modification of wireless facilities, and proposed changes to any
support structure consistent with this chapter;
      (5)   Determine the amount of and collect, as a condition of the
completeness of any application, any fee established by this chapter;
      (6)   Establish deadlines for submission of information related to an
application, and extend or shorten deadlines where appropriate and consistent
with state and federal laws and regulations;
      (7)   Issue any notices of incompleteness, requests for information or
conduct or commission such studies as may be required to determine whether a
permit should be issued;
      (8)   Require, as part of, and as a condition of, completeness of any
application, notice to members of the public that may be affected by the
placement or modification of the wireless facility and proposed changes to any
support structure;
      (9)   Subject to appeal as provided herein, determine whether to approve,
approve subject to conditions or deny an application; and
      (10)   Take such other steps as may be required to timely act upon
applications for placement of wireless facilities, including issuing written
decisions and entering into agreements to mutually extend the time for action
on an application.
   (B)   Appeal.
      (1)   Any person adversely affected by the decision of the Director,
pursuant to this chapter, may appeal the Director’s decision to the hearing
officer, as the term is defined in §
9.94.010, which may decide the issues de novo, and whose written decision will
be the final decision of the city. An appeal by a wireless infrastructure
provider must be taken jointly with the wireless service provider that intends
to use the personal wireless services facility.
      (2)   Where the Director grants an application based on a finding that
denial would result in a prohibition or effective prohibition under applicable
federal law, the decision shall be automatically appealed to the hearing
officer, consistent with provisions as provided in
Chapter 9.94. All appeals must be filed within two business days of the written
decision of the Director, unless the Director extends the time therefor. An
extension may not be granted where extension would result in approval of the
application by operation of law.

may be waived, but only to the minimum extent required to avoid the prohibition
or violation.
   (C)   Minimum standards. Wireless facilities shall be installed and modified
in a manner that minimizes risks to public safety, avoids placement of
aboveground facilities in underground areas, avoids installation of new support
structures in the public rights-of-way and otherwise maintains the integrity
and character of the neighborhoods and corridors in which the facilities are
located; ensures that installations are subject to periodic review to minimize
the intrusion on the rights-of-way; and ensures that the city bears no risk or
liability as a result of the installations, and that such use does not
inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of the rights-of-way
or hinder the ability of the city or other government agencies to improve,
modify, relocate, abandon or vacate the public rights-of-way or any portion
thereof or to cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation or
abandonment of facilities in the rights-of-way.
   (D)   Design and location standards. All applicants shall design and locate
the wireless facilities in accordance with the Design and Development Standards
for wireless facilities in the public right-of-way set forth and adopted by

right to enter, or direct its designee to enter, the facility and support,
repair, disable or remove any elements of the facility in emergencies or when
the facility threatens imminent harm to persons or property. The city shall
make an effort to contact the permittee prior to disabling or removing any
facility elements, but in any case shall notify permittee within 24 hours of
doing so.
      (7)   Contact. The permittee shall, at all times, maintain accurate
contact information for all parties responsible for the facility, which shall

      (9)   Indemnities.
         (a)   The permittee and, if applicable, the owner of the property upon
which the wireless facility is installed shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the city, its agents, officers, officials and employees:
            1.   From any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs
and expenses, and from any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, writs of mandamus
and other actions or proceedings brought against the city or its agents,
officers, officials or employees to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set
aside, void or annul the city’s approval of the permit; and
            2.   From any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs
and expenses, and any and all claims, demands, lawsuits or causes of action and
other actions or proceedings of any kind or form, whether for personal injury,
death or property damage, arising out of or in connection with the activities
or performance of the permittee or, if applicable, the property owner or any of
each one’s agents, employees, licensees, contractors, subcontractors or
independent contractors.
         (b)   In the event the city becomes aware of any such actions or
claims, the city shall promptly notify the permittee and, if applicable, the
property owner and shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The city shall
have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,

relocate, change or interfere with any existing structure, improvement or
property without the prior consent of the owner of that structure, city
improvement or property. No structure, improvement or property owned by the

the city determines that such movement will not adversely affect the city or
any surrounding businesses or residents, and the permittee pays all costs and
expenses related to the relocation of the city’s structure, improvement or
property. Prior to commencement of any work pursuant to a wireless encroachment
permit, the permittee shall provide the city with documentation establishing to
the city’s satisfaction that the permittee has the legal right to use or
interfere with any other structure, improvement or property within the public
right-of-way or city utility easement to be affected by permittee’s facilities.
      (12)   No right, title or interest. The permission granted by a wireless
encroachment permit shall not in any event constitute an easement on or an
encumbrance against the public right-of-way. No right, title or interest
(including franchise interest) in the public right-of-way, or any part thereof,
shall vest or accrue in permittee by reason of a wireless encroachment permit
or the issuance of any other permit or exercise of any privilege given thereby.
      (13)   No possessory interest. No possessory interest is created by a
wireless encroachment permit. However, to the extent that a possessory interest
is deemed created by a governmental entity with taxation authority, the
permittee acknowledges that the city has given, to the permittee, notice,
pursuant to Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, § 107.6, that the use or occupancy
of any public property, pursuant to a wireless encroachment permit, may create
a possessory interest which may be subject to the payment of property taxes
levied upon such interest. Permittee shall be solely liable for, and shall pay
and discharge prior to delinquency, any and all possessory interact taxes or
other taxes, fees and assessments levied against permittee’s right to
possession, occupancy or use of any public property pursuant to any right of
possession, occupancy or use created by this permit.
      (14)   General maintenance. The site and the facility, including, but not
limited to, all landscaping, fencing and related transmission equipment, must
be maintained in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved
plans. All graffiti on facilities must be removed at the sole expense of the
permittee within 48 hours after notification from the city.
      (15)   RF exposure compliance. All facilities must comply with all
standards and regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal government
agency with the authority to regulate RF exposure standards. After transmitter
and antenna system optimization, but prior to unattended operations of the
facility, permittee or its representative must conduct on-site post
installation RF emissions testing to demonstrate actual compliance with the FCC
OET Bulletin 65 RF emissions safety rules for general population/uncontrolled
RF exposure in all sectors. For this testing, the transmitter shall be
operating at maximum operating power, and the testing shall occur outwards to a
distance where the RF emissions no longer exceed the uncontrolled/general
population limit.
      (16)   Testing. Testing of any equipment shall take place on weekdays
only, and only between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., except that
testing is prohibited on holidays that fall on a weekday. In addition, testing
is prohibited on weekend days.
      (17)   Modifications. No changes shall be made to the approved plans
without review and approval in accordance with this chapter.
      (18)   Agreement with city. If not already completed, permittee shall
enter into the appropriate agreement with the city, as determined by the city,
prior to constructing, attaching or operating a facility on municipal
infrastructure. This permit is not a substitute for such agreement.
      (19)   Conflicts with improvements. For all facilities located within the
ROW, the permittee shall remove or relocate, at its expense and without expense
to the city, any or all of its facilities when such removal or relocation is
deemed necessary by the city by reason of any change of grade, alignment or
width of any right-of-way, for installation of services, water pipes, drains,
storm drains, power or signal lines, traffic-control devices, right-of-way
improvements or for any other construction, repair or improvement to the right-
of-way.
      (20)   Abandonment.
         (a)   If a facility is not operated for a continuous period of six
months, the wireless encroachment permit and any other permit or approval
therefor shall be deemed abandoned and terminated automatically, unless before
the end of the six-month period:
            1.   The Director has determined that the facility has resumed
operations; or
            2.   The city has received an application to transfer the permit to
another service provider.
         (b)   No later than 90 days from the date the facility is determined
to have ceased operation or the permittee has notified the Director of its
intent to vacate the site, the permittee shall remove all equipment and
improvements associated with the use and shall restore the site to its original
condition to the satisfaction of the Director. The permittee shall provide
written verification of the removal of the facilities within 30 days of the
date the removal is completed. If the facility is not removed within 30 days
after the permit has been discontinued pursuant to this division (A)(20), the
site shall be deemed to be a nuisance, and the city may cause the facility to
be removed at permittee’s expense or by calling any bond or other financial
assurance to pay for removal. If there are two or more users of a single
facility or support structure, then this provision shall apply to the specific
elements or parts thereof that were abandoned, but will not be effective for
the entirety thereof until all users cease use thereof.
      (21)   Encourage co-location. Where the facility site is capable of
accommodating a co-located facility upon the same site in a manner consistent
with the permit conditions for the existing facility, the owner and operator of
the existing facility shall allow co-location of third party facilities;
provided the parties can mutually agree upon reasonable terms and conditions.
      (22)   Records. The permittee must maintain complete and accurate copies
of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the
facility, which includes, without limitation, this approval, the approved plans
and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all conditions
associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or approvals issued
in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not
maintain such records as required in this condition or fails to produce true
and complete copies of such records within a reasonable time after a written
request from the city, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved
through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the
permittee.
      (23)   Attorneys’ fees. In the event the city determines that it is
necessary to take legal action to enforce any of these conditions, or to revoke
a permit, and such legal action is taken, the permittee shall be required to
pay any and all costs of such legal action, including reasonable attorneys’
fees, incurred by the city, even if the matter is not prosecuted to a final
judgment or is amicably resolved, unless the city should otherwise agree with
permittee to waive said fees or any part thereof. The foregoing shall not apply
if the permittee prevails in the enforcement proceeding.
   (B)   Eligible facilities requests. In addition to the conditions provided
in Section 9(a) of this Chapter and any supplemental conditions imposed by the
Director or hearing officer, as the case may be, all permits for an eligible
facility requests granted pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to the
following additional conditions, unless modified by the approving authority.
      (1)   Permit subject to conditions of underlying permit. Any permit
granted in response to an application qualifying as an eligible facilities
request shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying permit.
      (2)   No permit term extension. The city’s grant or grant by operation of
law of an eligible facilities request permit constitutes a federally-mandated
modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject tower or base
station. Notwithstanding any permit duration established in another permit
condition, the city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a eligible
facilities request permit will not extend the permit term for the underlying
permit or any other underlying regulatory approval, and its term shall be
coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the
subject tower, utility pole or base station.
      (3)   No waiver of standing. The city’s grant or grant by operation of
law of an eligible facilities request does not waive, and shall not be
construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge § 6409(a) of the
Spectrum Act, any FCC rules that interpret § 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act or any
modification to § 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act.
   (C)   Small cell facilities requests. In addition to the conditions provided
in Section 9(a) of this Chapter and any supplemental conditions imposed by the
Director or hearing officer, as the case may be, all permits for a small cell
facility granted pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to the following
condition, unless modified by the approving authority: the city’s grant of a
permit for a small cell facility request does not waive, and shall not be
construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge any FCC orders or
rules related to small cell facilities, or any modification to those FCC orders
or rules.

include, but need not be limited to, the size, type and desired design
character of the public works project; performance specifications covering the
quality of materials, equipment, workmanship, preliminary plans or building
layouts; or any other information deemed necessary to describe adequately the
city’s needs. The performance specifications and any plans shall be prepared by
a design professional who is duly licensed and registered in the state.
   (B)   (1)   The procurement agent shall prepare and issue a request for
qualifications in order to pre-qualify or short-list the design-build entities
whose proposals shall be evaluated for final selection.

         (a)   Identification of the basic scope and needs of the public works
project or contract, the expected cost range, the methodology that will be used
by the city to evaluate proposals, the procedure for final selection of the
design-build entity and any other information deemed necessary by the city to
inform interested parties of the contracting opportunity;
         (b)   Significant factors that the city reasonably expects to consider
in evaluating qualifications, including technical design and construction
expertise, acceptable safety record and all other non-price-related factors;
         (c)   1.   A standard template request for statements of
qualifications prepared by the city. In preparing the standard template, the
city may consult with the construction industry, the building trades and surety
industry and other cities using design-build procurement.
            2.   The template shall require the following information:
               a.   If the design-build entity is a privately held corporation,
limited liability company, partnership or joint venture, a listing of all of
the shareholders, partners or members known at the time of statement of
qualification submission who will perform work on the public works project;
               b.   Evidence that the members of the design-build team have
completed, or demonstrated the experience, competency, capability and capacity
to complete projects of similar size, scope or complexity, and that proposed
key personnel have sufficient experience and training to competently manage and
complete the design and construction of the public works project, and a
financial statement that ensures that the design-build entity has the capacity
to complete the public works project;
               c.   The licenses, registration and credentials required to
design and construct the public works project, including, but not limited to,
information on the revocation or suspension of any license, credential or
registration;
               d.   Evidence that establishes that the design-build entity has
the capacity to obtain all required payment and performance bonding, liability
insurance and errors and omissions insurance;
               e.   Information concerning workers’ compensation experience
history and a worker safety program;
               f.   If the proposed design-build entity is a corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture or other legal entity, a
copy of the organizational documents or agreement committing to form the
organization; and
               g.   An acceptable safety record. A proposer’s safety record
shall be deemed acceptable if its experience modification rate for the most
recent three-year period is an average of 1.00 or less, and its average total
recordable injury or illness rate and average lost work rate for the most
recent three-year period does not exceed the applicable statistical standards
for its business category or if the proposer is a party to an alternative
dispute resolution system as provided for in the Cal. Labor Code, § 3201.5.
         (d)   1.   The information required under this section shall be
certified under penalty of perjury by the design-build entity and its general
partners or joint venture members.

         (a)   Identification of the basic scope and needs of the public works
project or contract, the estimated cost of the public works project, the
methodology that will be used by the city to evaluate proposals, whether the
contract will be awarded on the basis of low bid or best value and any other
information deemed necessary by the city to inform interested parties of the
contracting opportunity;
         (b)   Significant factors that the city reasonably expects to consider
in evaluating proposals, including, but not limited to, cost or price and all
non-price-related factors;
         (c)   The relative importance or the weight assigned to each of the
factors identified in the request for proposals; and
         (d)   Where a best value selection method is used, the city may
reserve the right to request proposal revisions and hold discussions and
negotiations with responsive proposers, in which case the city shall so specify
in the request for proposals and shall publish separately or incorporate into
the request for proposals applicable procedures to be observed by the city to
ensure that any discussions or negotiations are conducted in good faith.
   (D)   For those public works projects utilizing low bid as the final
selection method, the competitive bidding process shall result in lump-sum bids
by the pre-qualified or short-listed design-build entities, and awards shall be
made by the Mayor and City Council or, for public works projects undertaken by
the City Municipal Water Department, the Board of Water Commissioners, to the
design-build entity that is the lowest responsible bidder.
   (E)   For those public works projects utilizing best value as a selection
method, the design-build competition shall progress as follows.
      (1)   Competitive proposals shall be evaluated by using only the criteria
and selection procedures specifically identified in the request for proposals.
The following minimum factors, however, shall be weighted as deemed appropriate
by the procurement agent:
         (a)   Price, unless a stipulated sum is specified;
         (b)   Technical design and construction expertise; and
         (c)   Life-cycle costs over 15 or more years.
      (2)   Pursuant to division (C) above, the city may hold discussions or
negotiations with responsive proposers using the process articulated in the
city’s request for proposals.
      (3)   When the evaluation is complete, the responsive proposers shall be
ranked based on a determination of value provided; provided that no more than
three proposers are required to be ranked.
      (4)   The award of the contract shall be made to the responsible design-
build entity whose proposal is determined by the Mayor and City Council, or for
public works projects undertaken by the City Municipal Water Department, the
Board of Water Commissioners, to have offered the best value to the public.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, upon issuance of
a contract award, the city shall publicly announce its award, identifying the
design-build entity to which the award is made, along with a statement
regarding the basis of the award.
      (6)   The statement regarding the city’s contract award, described in
division (E)(5) above, and the contract file shall provide sufficient
information to satisfy an external audit.

(sometimes referred to as “Off-Street Parking Ordinance”).
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.020 FINDINGS AND GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (A)   The Mayor and City Council find that, in order to provide an orderly
procedure for the acquisition, construction, improvement, completion, repair,
management, reconstruction, administration, maintenance, operation and disposal
of public off-street parking places, issuance and payment of bonds to pay the
cost thereof; the making of contributions therefor; and the making of covenants
and agreements with the bond holders for the security and payment of such
bonds, it is necessary for the city to exercise the powers it has by virtue of
being a home rule city and to provide such a procedure. As used in this
chapter, PARKING PLACES includes public parking lots, garages, buildings and
other improvements for the parking of motor vehicles. The procedure provided
for in this chapter is to be an alternative to any others provided by, under or
pursuant to the City Charter or the general laws of the state.
   (B)   In addition to matters specified elsewhere in this chapter, the city
is authorized to perform the acts authorized by the procedural alternatives,
including, without limitation, the following:
      (1)   Acquire, by condemnation, purchase, gift, lease or any other means,
property necessary or convenient for use as parking places, including any
property necessary or convenient for the opening, widening, straightening or
extending of streets or alleys necessary or convenient for ingress to or egress
from any parking place;
      (2)   Improve any property by the construction thereon of garages,
buildings or other improvements necessary or convenient for parking purposes;
      (3)   Improve parking places and any property necessary or convenient for
ingress to or egress from parking places;
      (4)   Administer, maintain, operate and repair parking places or provide
therefor;
      (5)   Collect fees or charges to pay all or any part of the cost of
improving, repairing, maintaining and operating parking places and of acquiring
and improving additional parking places;
      (6)   Levy taxes to pay all or any part of the cost of improving,
repairing, maintaining and operating parking places and of acquiring and
improving additional parking places;
      (7)   Employ engineers, attorneys and other persons necessary or
convenient for the doing of any act authorized by this chapter; and
      (8)   Do all acts and things necessary or convenient for the
accomplishment of the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.030 CHAPTER NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   This chapter is not exclusive. The Mayor and City Council shall have the
power to provide other procedures or to follow parking place or district
procedures now or hereafter provided by general law; provided, however, that
whenever the city is acting pursuant to this chapter, the provisions of this
chapter shall be controlling to the extent that they are in conflict with any
of the provisions of said laws.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.040 INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS.
   Whenever the Mayor and City Council deem it necessary to provide public off-
street parking places under and pursuant to this chapter, the Mayor and City
Council shall, by resolution, declare their intention to proceed and shall
describe, in general terms, the procedural alternative they intend to follow;
the proposed improvements or acquisitions involved; the estimated costs of the
improvements or acquisitions involved; and the maximum amount of bonds, if any,
to be issued to finance the improvements or acquisitions. The requirement of a
resolution as provided for in this section may be satisfied by the adoption of
the resolution provided for in §§
12.84.050 through
12.84.130.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.050 DETERMINATION THAT PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY REQUIRE
IMPROVEMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS.
   Before ordering any acquisitions or improvements or both, or the creation of
any district pursuant to this chapter, where the costs of the acquisitions or
improvements are to be paid in whole or in part by special assessment or other
special assessment taxes upon property, whether the special assessment will be
specific or a special assessment tax upon property wholly or partially
according to the assessed value of such property, the Mayor and City Council
shall find that the public convenience and necessity require such acquisitions
or improvements or both, in the manner provided in § 19, Article XVI of the
California Constitution.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.060 PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY.
   A resolution of preliminary determination shall be adopted, describing, in
general terms, the intention to proceed under this chapter, the procedural
alternative to be followed; the proposed improvements or acquisitions involved;
the estimated costs of such improvements or acquisitions; whether the
assessment is to be levied on all real property or on land only; the amount,
based upon the estimated costs, to be assessed against each particular parcel;
the maximum amount of bonds, if any, to be issued to finance the proposed
improvements or acquisitions. The resolution shall also state that any person
interested may file a protest in writing with the City Clerk containing therein
a description of the property in which the signer thereof is interested
sufficient to identify the same and, if the signers are not shown on the last
equalized assessment roll as the owners of such property, must contain or be
accompanied by written evidence that such signers are the owners of such
property. The resolution shall also set a time and place when and where any and
all persons interested may appear and show cause, if they have any, why the
Mayor and City Council should not find and determine that the public
convenience and necessity require the formation of the proposed improvement
district and the proposed acquisitions or improvements without compliance with
the Special Assessment Investigation, Limitation and Majority Protest Act of
1931, sometimes referred to in this chapter as “Investigation Act.”

§ 12.84.280 RENTAL OF FACILITIES.
   The city may acquire, construct, rent, lease, maintain, repair, manage and

(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.290 INCIDENTAL USE.
   (A)   As an incident to the operation of any parking facility, the city may
devote a portion of its property to uses such as retail stores, bus terminal,
gasoline service station, helicopter landing area or any other commercial use,
when, in its judgment, it is convenient or necessary to conduct or permit such
use in order to utilize the property as a parking facility. Any such incidental
use shall be secondary to the primary use as a parking facility, and the
portion of the land devoted to the incidental use shall not exceed 25% of the
surface area of the property. If a building is erected on the property for the
purpose of parking motor vehicles, the incidental use of the building shall not

space devoted to commercial purposes other than parking vehicles to any person,
firm, corporation or non-profit association or corporation as the Mayor and

other like structural forms may be constructed in any feasible manner, as an
integral part thereof or otherwise, for provision or utilization of air rights
sites for buildings to be used for, without limitation, residential, commercial
or other uses; provided that the cost of such structural forms shall be
recovered from the parties utilizing such air rights sites and used, as
determined by the Mayor and City Council, to pay the costs of acquisition,
construction, improvement, completion, repair, management, reconstruction,
administration, maintenance or operation of the parking places involved or
other parking places located within the city.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.300 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   The Mayor and City Council, subject to the provisions of the City Charter,
may determine that any parcel of property, or any improvements, extensions or
replacements thereof or additions thereto, either acquired from the proceeds of
the bonds or leased to the city with rents therefor derived from assessments
levied pursuant to this chapter are no longer needed for off-street parking
purposes or such facilities may be otherwise better provided. Subject to the
provisions of the City Charter, and any restriction in the resolution providing
for the issuance of any outstanding bonds relating to the facilities involved,
the property may thereafter be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of, either
during or after the term of the bonds and the proceeds placed in a fund as
designated by the Mayor and City Council and used for the purposes of this
chapter.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976; Ord. 3759, passed 9-13-1978)
§ 12.84.310 OTHER PROCEDURES.
   When proceedings are had under this chapter, its provisions may be
supplemented by other proceedings or as otherwise provided in the resolution of

places made available for public or private uses pursuant to agreement with the
city, credit for taxes or assessments paid to the city and used primarily for
parking purposes, and the replenishment for Reserve Funds.

§ 12.84.320 ASSESSMENT WITHOUT BONDS.
   In addition, or as an alternative to, the other provisions contained in
Procedural Alternatives II or III, the Mayor and City Council may provide in
the resolution of intention for the levy each year of an ad valorem assessment
on all taxable real property or all taxable land, as the case may be, within
the district to provide monies for all or any part of the costs and expenses of
providing parking places prior to the issuance of bonds or without issuing
bonds. The costs and expenses of providing parking places may include, but
shall not be limited to, lease payments, the costs and expenses of operating,
maintaining, repairing and improving the parking places, engineering fees,
appraisal fees, legal fees, financial consultant fees, cost of land and rights-
of-way acquisition, expenses of all proceedings for the formation of the
district and all other costs and expenses for carrying out the purposes of this
chapter. The rate of ad valorem assessment shall be fixed by the Mayor and City
Council each year so as to produce sums required to pay the estimated costs and
expenses mentioned above. The assessment shall be levied, collected and

   The bonds shall be special obligations of and be issued on behalf of the
improvement district, and shall be designated in accordance with the prior
proceedings. Each bond shall state, in substance, that the bond is not a
general obligation of the city, nor is the credit of the city or the property
or revenue of any public utility owned by the city pledged for its payment; and
that the bond is a special obligation of and is issued on behalf of the
improvement district; and that ad valorem assessments levied for the payment of
the interest thereon and principal thereof shall be levied upon the taxable
real property or land only, as the case may be, in the improvement district.

§ 12.84.700 PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS INTO CITY TREASURY - SPECIAL IMPROVEMENT FUNDS
- EXPENDITURE FOR PURPOSE OF DEBT - APPLICATION OF SURPLUS ON ACCOMPLISHMENT OF
PURPOSE.
   The proceeds from the sale of bonds, except for premium and accrued
interest, if any, shall be paid into the City Treasury, placed to the credit of
a Special Improvement Fund, Debt Service Fund and any Reserve Fund; all as
provided in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds and expended
only in connection with the purpose for which the indebtedness was created.
When such purpose has been accomplished, any monies remaining in the Special
Improvement Fund may be transferred to the Debt Service Fund to be used for the
payment of principal of and interest on the bonds or to any Reserve Fund
established therefor. Premium and accrued interest, if any, shall be paid into
the Treasury and placed to the credit of the fund to be used for the payment of
the principal of and interest on the bonds.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.710 INTEREST PAID FROM BOND PROCEEDS - MAXIMUM LIMITATION.
   Interest on the bonds coming due before the proceeds of a tax levied at the
next general tax levy after the sale of the bonds are available, and/or
interest on any bonds coming due before the expiration of one year following
completion of the acquisition and construction of the works and improvements
for which the bonds were issued, may be paid from the proceeds of the sale of
the bonds as may be provided in the resolution providing for the issuance of
the bonds.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.720 BONDS - PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.
   (A)   At the time of making the general tax levy after the issuance of the
bonds, as may be provided in the resolution providing for the issuance of the
bonds, and annually thereafter until the bonds are paid or until there is a sum
in the Treasury set apart for that purpose sufficient to meet all payments of
principal and interest on the bonds as they become due, the Mayor and City
Council shall cause an assessment to be levied upon all real property or land
only, as the case may be, in the improvement district sufficient to pay the
interest on the bonds and such part of the principal as will become due before
the proceeds of such an assessment levied at the next general tax levy will be
available and to provide a contingency reserve for delinquencies. Such
assessment shall be levied and collected at the same time as other city taxes,
and shall be used only for the payment of interest on and principal of the
bonds. Assessments for the payment of such bonds shall constitute a lien on all
of the taxable real property within the improvement district. Such liens shall
be of the same force and effect as other liens for city taxes and their
collection may be enforced by the same means as provided for the enforcement of
liens for city taxes.
   (B)   Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the Mayor and City
Council from using any lawfully available funds of the city, including, without
limitation, those which are attributable to the improvement district, for
payment of such principal and interest, and to the extent that such funds are
in the treasury set apart for that purpose, the assessment required by this
article need not be levied. For purposes of this article, the phrase “funds of
the City which are attributable to the district includes without limitation,
grants from other governmental agencies to the City on” behalf of the
improvement district or venues raised by operation of the facilities
constructed under this chapter within the improvement district.
(Ord. 3589, passed 7-6-1976)
§ 12.84.730 ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS.
   The annual assessment provided for in this article shall be computed on the
basis of the formula set forth in the resolution of intention to form the
district as originally adopted or as modified by subsequent change and
modification or other proceedings conducted pursuant to this chapter or any
other law, and shall be, without limitation, upon the rate or period thereof.
If the assessed value of any parcel of property does not appear on the tax
roll, an estimated assessed value of such parcel shall be made by the Director
of Development Services in consultation with the County Assessor, and such
estimate shall for purposes of such ad valorem assessment be considered the
assessed value of such parcel.
   (A)   Supplemental advances and levies. The provisions of the Cal. Streets
and Highways Code, §§ 8800 to 8809, inclusive, shall apply to assessments
levied hereunder.
   (B)   Additional collection provision. The provisions of the Cal. Streets
and Highways Code, §§ 8680 to 8688, inclusive, and §§ 8830 to 8837, inclusive,
of the state shall apply to assessments levied hereunder.
   (C)   Charges. Should the Mayor and City Council determine to prescribe,
revise and collect fees, tolls, rates, rentals and other charges (other than
special assessments), including, but not necessarily limited to, service
charges and standby or maximum charges for services or facilities furnished by
the district, charges for the availability of the facilities of the district
regardless of whether the facilities are used or not, the same shall be done by
resolution. Such charges shall be payable on a uniform and equitable basis by
the owner of the property to which the facilities of the district are
available, including the owners of publicly owned property. Any delinquent
charges and all penalties thereon when recorded as hereinafter provided shall
constitute a lien on the real property to which the facilities of the district
are available (except that no such lien shall be created against any publicly
owned property), and such lien shall continue until the charge and all
penalties thereon are fully paid or the property sold therefor. All remedies
provided for collection of due and unpaid charges which are provided in the
California Revenue Bond Law of 1941 (commencing with Cal. Gov’t Code, § 54300)
may be exercised to enforce payment of such charges shall not be adopted until
the Mayor and City Council have given notice of and held a hearing thereon
substantially as provided in the Cal. Gov’t Code, § 54354.5, being part of the
Revenue Bond Law of 1941.

§ 12.84.740 EXEMPTION OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Should there be included in the district property used for residential
purposes, including in said term single-family and multiple-unit residential
property, regardless of the zoning applicable thereto, the same shall be exempt
from the assessments levied hereunder, so long as such property is lawfully
used for residential purposes, upon a finding by the Mayor and City Council
that:
      (1)   Such property is lawfully used for residential purposes; and
      (2)   Such property has adequate off-street parking for the residential
uses involved.
   (B)   Each year, at the time of levying the assessment as provided in this
chapter, such findings shall be reviewed, to the end that such exempt property
will no longer be exempt and will be assessed:
      (1)   When the use is changed from its exempt residential use; and/or
      (2)   When the property although still devoted to the same use no longer
has adequate off-street parking.
   (C)   Should a particular parcel of real property have another use, in
addition to the residential use, only the proportionate value thereof
attributable to the residential use shall be exempt.

the costs of said acquisitions or improvements, construction, completion,
repair, management, reconstruction, administration, maintenance and/or

that the public convenience and necessity require such acquisitions,
improvements, construction, completion, repair, management, reconstruction,
administration, maintenance and/or operation in the manner provided in § 19,
Article XVI of the California Constitution.
   (B)   Preliminary determination of necessity and intention to proceed. A
resolution of preliminary determination of necessity and intention to proceed
(hereinafter referred to as resolution of intention) shall be adopted
describing in general terms, the following:
      (1)   The intention to proceed under this chapter;
      (2)   The proposed improvements, acquisition, construction, completion,
repair, management, reconstruction, administration, maintenance and/or
operation involved;
      (3)   The assessment financing alternative to be followed;

      (10)   That such resolution, together with a general description of the
proposed improvement and a map showing the exterior boundaries of the proposed
improvement district with relation to the territory immediately contiguous
thereto and to the proposed improvement, is on file with the City Clerk and is
available for inspection by any person or persons interested. This map shall
govern for all details as to the extent of the proposed improvement district;
      (11)   The resolution shall also state the time and place for a hearing
by the Mayor and City Council when and where any and all persons interested may
appear and show cause, if any, why the Mayor and City Council should not find
and determine that the public convenience and necessity require the formation
of the proposed improvement district and the proposed acquisitions or
improvements without compliance with the Special Assessment Investigation,
Limitation and Majority Protest Act of 1931 (hereinafter referred to as the
“Act”); on the question of the estimated cost; the amount of bonds to be
issued, if any; and the intention of the Mayor and City Council to proceed; and
      (12)   The resolution shall also state that at the time and place
specified in the resolution that any person interested will be heard; and, for
the purpose of determining a majority protest, any holder of title to taxable
real property within the proposed improvement district, acting individually or
as part of a group, may file a protest. Any such protest must be filed in
writing with the City Clerk, and shall include a description of the property in
which the signer thereof is interested sufficient to identify the same. If the
signers are not shown on the last equalized assessment roll as the owners of
such property, such protest must be accompanied by written evidence that such
signers are the owners of such property.
   (C)   Notice of hearing. Notice of hearing as set forth in the resolution
shall be given as follows:
      (1)   By publishing a copy of the resolution of intention once at least
15 days prior to the time fixed for the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the city;
      (2)   By posting a notice of the adoption of the resolution of intention
on all open streets within the district at not more than 300 foot intervals,
but not less than three in all, on each street so posted, at least 15 days
before the time fixed for the hearing. No proceeding shall be held invalid for
failure to post any street if this section has been substantially complied
with. If the boundaries of the proposed assessment district include more than
one-half square mile in area, posting requirements shall be satisfied by the
City Clerk posting such notice conspicuously on or near the main door of the
Council Chambers at least five days prior to the time fixed for the hearing.
For such districts, no street posting shall be required;
      (3)   By mailing a notice of the adoption of said resolution of intention
at least 15 days before the time fixed for the hearing to each holder of title
to taxable real property within the proposed improvement district as such
ownership is shown on the last equalized county assessment roll. The notices
posted and mailed shall conform to the Cal. Streets and Highways Code, §§ 5193
and 5195, respectively. The City Clerk shall cause all the above notices to be
given;
      (4)   At least 15 days before the time fixed for the hearing, the
engineer shall record an Assessment District Boundary Map with the County
Recorder, said map to conform to the requirements of Cal. Streets and Highways
Code, § 3110;
      (5)   The Mayor and City Council may proceed without notice and hearing
if, when considering passage of the resolution of intention, it is determined
by at least a four-fifths affirmative vote thereof (as determined in division
(D) below) that all of the owners of lots or land liable to be assessed or
their bona fide agents, have signed and filled a petition requesting the
formation of the district, indicate that they have no objections to the
proposed work or work and acquisition and agree as to the extent of the
district to be assessed and waive notice and hearing; and
      (6)   If the Mayor and City Council are proceeding pursuant to division
(C)(5) above, the map required to be recorded, pursuant to division (C)(4)
above, shall be recorded within five days after adoption of the resolution of
intention.
   (D)   Majority protest. The Mayor and City Council shall set forth, in the
resolution of intention, the basis by which a determination shall be made
whether a majority protest exists; possible bases may include, but shall not be
limited to, determination based on land area, assessed valuation of real
property, assessed valuation of land only or the number of property owners or
any other suitable determinant. At the time set for hearing protests, the Mayor
and City Council shall proceed to hear and pass upon all protests so made and
its decision shall be final and conclusive. The Mayor and City Council may
adjourn the hearing, from time to time. Any such protest may be withdrawn by
any owner making the same, either in writing at any time prior to the
conclusion of said protest hearing or any adjournment thereof, or orally on the
record during a hearing. If the Mayor and City Council find that the written
protests are made by persons who represent more than 50% of the property to be
assessed for the improvements, as determined on the basis of the determining
factor announced in advance, and protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the
same to less than a majority, no further proceedings shall be taken for a
period of one year from the date of the decision of the Mayor and City Council
on the hearing, unless the protests are overruled by action of the Mayor and
City Council. Action to overrule a majority protest shall require not less than
a four-fifths affirmative vote of the Council members present and voting; for
this purpose, five affirmative votes of six voting, or six affirmative votes of
seven voting shall be required.

either by separate boundaries, coloring or other convenient and graphic method,
so that all persons interested may with accuracy ascertain within which zone
any parcel of property is located.

   (A)   The Mayor and City Council shall determine which of various financing
alternatives shall be utilized.
   (B)   Alternatives available include the following.
      (1)   The improvement and/or acquisition may be pre-funded by the city

same time, and with the same penalties and interest, as in the case of taxes
levied for the city, to secure repayment to the city of said pre-funding.
      (2)   Bonds may be issued to finance the improvement and/or acquisition
and the assessment may be levied, collected and enforced in the same manner, at
the same time and with the same penalties and interest, as in the case of taxes

bonds. If this assessment financing alternative is used, the city may retain
bond counsel to provide the details of the issuance and repayment of said
bonds.

§ 12.90.090 ASSESSMENT ACCORDING TO BENEFIT.
   (A)   Assessment. After the adoption of the resolution ordering work, the
engineer shall proceed to estimate as to all lots and parcels of land within
the assessment district, as shown by the diagram map, the benefits arising from
such work, and to be received by each such lot or parcel of land. He or she
shall thereupon prepare an assessment roll for submission to the Mayor and City
Council for confirmation, by resolution, which assesses upon and against the
lands in the assessment district the total amount of the costs and expenses of
such work and/or the cost of management administration, maintenance or
operation of the improvement, if any, for the first year or for the term of the
assessment. Such roll shall assess the total sum upon the several lots or
parcels of land in the assessment district benefitted thereby, in proportion to
the estimated benefits to be received by each of the several lots or parcels of
land within the district or within each zone included in the district, if any.
   (B)   Method of determining the assessment benefit. The method of
determining the assessment benefit to be received by each of the said several
lots or parcels of land within the district and/or zone shall be set forth in
the resolution of intention, which may include, but shall not be limited to,
land area, assessed valuation of real property, assessed valuation of land only
or number of lots or parcels.
   (C)   Assessment computation. The annual assessment provided for in this
section shall be computed on the basis of the formula set forth in the
resolution of intention originally adopted or as modified by subsequent change
and modification or other proceedings conducted pursuant to this chapter or any
other law, and the limitations upon the rate or period thereof provided in the
Act (as defined in §
12.90.040(B)(11)) shall not apply. If the assessed value of any parcel of
property does not appear on the tax roll, an estimated assessed value of such
parcel shall be made by the Director of Development Services in consultation
with the County Assessor, and such estimate shall, for purposes of such ad
valorem assessment, be considered the assessed value of such parcel.
   (D)   Subsequent year assessments. Except as otherwise provided by the
issuance of bonds, the cost for the improvement and/or acquisition or
management, administration, maintenance or operation of the improvement, if
any, for any subsequent fiscal year during which an assessment is to be levied
and collected within the assessment district pursuant to this chapter, shall be
accomplished by preparing an assessment roll for submission to the Mayor and
City Council for confirmation by resolution for each fiscal year in which the
assessment is to be levied and collected, and shall constitute the levy of an
assessment for the fiscal year referred to in the assessment. When a bond issue
funds the costs involved, such assessments shall be levied and collected as
specified in the bond authorizing resolution or ordinance.

right-of-way, unless it is of the same width as a regular residential minimum-
width street, approved as part of a master plan of circulation or streets by
the city. In the case of an alley, BLOCK means property facing both sides of
any alley between the next intersecting streets or alleys, or between the
terminus of an alley and an intersecting street. In the case of street
lighting, BLOCK means property facing the side of any street on which the

the next intersecting streets on the side to be improved or between the
terminus of a dedicated right-of-way of a street and a street intersecting the
side to be improved and the property facing the opposite side of the street.
Where a BLOCK exceeds 1,000 feet in length, a length of frontage of 1,000 feet
constitutes a BLOCK as used in this chapter, if so designated by the Director
of Development Services. A determination by the Director of Development
Services of such a 1,000-foot BLOCK establishes a BLOCK and cannot later be
changed to include a portion of said 1,000-foot BLOCK in another BLOCK.
      COST, CONSTRUCTION COST or variants thereof. The actual cost of
construction of the work and any incidental or administrative expenses.

      FRONTING and FACING. Abutting in the case of property adjoining an alley
improvement. In the case of street lighting, in determining how much of the
front footage of a block has been improved, the front footage of property
benefitting from existing installations may be included regardless of the side
of the street on which the installation has been constructed.

line of the street, full pavement in alleys, storm and sanitary drainage
facilities, water mains, pipes, conduits, tunnels, hydrants and other necessary
works and appliances for providing water service, paving to provide a parking

   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to assure that activities occurring in
the management zone, including, but not limited to, development, digging,
drilling, boring or reconstruction of wells; extraction of ground water from
wells; and spreading of water do not interfere with or cause pass through of
contaminants from the Newmark and Muscoy Operable Units. Activities, such as
well construction or reconstruction or artificial recharge undertaken in the
management zone, shall not cause or contribute to the migration of ground water
contaminants from the Newmark and Muscoy Operable Units to uncontaminated
areas, nor shall such activities, even at their maximum operation, interfere
with or adversely affect the integrity of the Newmark or Muscoy extraction and
treatment systems, nor shall they otherwise interfere with the performance of
these interim remedial actions at the Newmark and Muscoy Operable Units.
   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to assure the protection of
human health and the environment, and compliance with relevant federal and
state requirements directly associated with the performance of the remedy. It
is the further purpose of this chapter to manage the spreading of water within
the management zone and manage the development, digging, drilling, boring,
reconstruction of wells and extraction of ground water from wells; to assure
compliance with the remedial program set forth in the RODs, consent decree and
statement of work, as defined below; and aid in the eventual restoration of the
aquifer to beneficial use.
   (C)   It is the further intent of this chapter to regulate activities within
the management zone only to the extent necessary to achieve the purposes set
forth and to minimize the regulatory impacts to those intending to spread water
or develop ground water resources in the management zone. In addition to any
other requirements of this chapter, the following requirements shall apply to
the management zone. Nothing contained herein shall exclude compliance with the
other provisions of this chapter. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this chapter and any other chapter, the terms and provisions of
this chapter shall apply.
§ 13.25.015 BACKGROUND PERTAINING TO NEWMARK GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
SUPERFUND SITE.
   Background:
   (A)   In 1980, the state performed sampling of certain wells belonging to
the City Municipal Water Department (“SBMWD”). These samples disclosed the
presence of various contaminants, including trichloroethylene (“TCE”) and
perchloroethylene (“PCE”).
   (B)   Pursuant to § 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. § 9605, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) placed the Newmark Ground Water
Contamination Superfund Site (“site”) on the National Priorities List (“NPL”),
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. pt. 300, Appendix B, by publication in the Federal
Register on March 31, 1989, 54 Fed. Reg. 13296, 13301.
   (C)   In late 1990, EPA commenced a remedial investigation (“RI”) focusing
on the Newmark Operable Unit (“OU”). In September 1992, EPA expanded the RI to
include the Muscoy OU.
   (D)   In March 1993, EPA published notice of the completion of the
feasibility study (“FS”) and the proposed plan for interim remedial action
pertaining to the Newmark OU. In December 1994, EPA published notice of the
completion of the FS and proposed plan for interim remedial action pertaining
to the Muscoy OU.
   (E)   EPA’s determinations concerning the interim remedial actions to be
implemented at the site are set forth in the Newmark OU record of decision
(“ROD”), signed August 4, 1993, and Muscoy ROD signed March 24, 1995 and the
explanation of significant differences (“ESD”) signed on August 18, 2004.
   (F)   On September 18, 1995, EPA, the state and SBMWD entered into a
cooperative agreement providing, in part, for SBMWD to perform the operation
and maintenance (“O&M”) of the remedial action set forth in the RODs, and for
EPA to fund the O&M.
   (G)   In September 1996, the SBMWD commenced an action against the United
States Army, pursuant to §§ 107 and 113 of CERCLA, seeking to obtain its costs
for response and the operation and maintenance of the Newmark and Muscoy OUs
(City of San Bernardino v. United States of America, Dept. of the Army, et al.
USDC Case No. CV 96-5205 MRP (JGx) consolidated with USDC Case No. CV 96-8867
MRP (JGx)).
   (H)   Commencing in June 2000, SBMWD, State Department of Toxic Substance
Control (“DTSC”) and EPA commenced negotiations to resolve various issues
relating to the site OU, Newmark OU and Muscoy OU. On March 23, 2005, the
consent decree memorializing the settlement was entered by the court.
   (I)   The consent decree requires, in part, for the city to implement an
ordinance providing for protection and management of the interim remedy set
forth in the RODs and ESD and specifically for the city to regulate the
spreading and extraction of water from the Bunker Hill Basin within the city in
order to prevent or correct spreading practices or extraction operations that
could interfere with or interrupt or degrade the performance of the interim
remedy.
   (J)   The protection of ground water resources within the city is of utmost
importance to the city and SBMWD. The public health, safety and general welfare
of the people of the state and of the more than 600,000 residents of the
Counties of San Bernardino and Riverside, who depend upon the continued
availability of potable ground water from the Bunker Hill Basin, is paramount.
The public health, safety and general welfare of the people of the state and
the residents of the city require assurance that spreading of water and
extraction of ground water do not interrupt or interfere with the construction,
operation and maintenance of the interim remedy or degrade the performance of
the interim remedy.
   (K)   The interim remedy requires, in part, the extraction of contaminated
ground water from the Bunker Hill Water Basin, and within the Newmark and
Muscoy OUs, and treatment of the ground water to meet all state and federal
permits and requirements for drinking water and delivery of treated water to
SBMWD for distribution to the public through its potable water system, or in
the alternative, for recharge to the aquifer.
   (L)   The inhibitor wells are located at the downgradient end of the
management zone. The inhibitor wells currently in place were designed to
function based upon hydrological factors relating to the flow of water through
the basin. The rate of flow through the basin may increase when additional
spreading occurs at spreading basins located upgradient from the inhibitor
wells. Another factor affecting flow rate is the amount of water flowing
through the basin and either extracted or flowing out of the basin. When
extraction of ground water occurs downgradient or to the side of management
zone, or the capacity of existing downgradient or adjacent wells are increased,
the rate of flow may increase. Should an increase in the flow of water occur
beyond the capacity of the inhibitor wells, the inhibitor wells may not be able
to contain and extract the additional contaminated water before it enters the
aquifer downgradient from the inhibitor wells.
   (M)   As required by the consent decree, the city must exercise its police
power to protect the public welfare of the city by adopting reasonable
regulatory measures.
§ 13.25.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADVERSE EFFECT and ADVERSELY EFFECT. Any proposed new or reconstructed well,
or any water spreading (artificial recharge) activity, forecast to reduce
particle capture (as measured using predictive particle tracking) below 95% at

§ 13.25.025 PERMITS.
   (A)   Spreading. Unless a permit issued by SBMWD pursuant to this chapter is
first obtained, it shall be unlawful for any person, as principal, agent or
employee, to spread water (artificial recharge) within the management zone.
   (B)   Ground water extraction. Unless a permit issued by SBMWD pursuant to
this chapter is first obtained, it shall be unlawful for any person to develop,
dig or drill a new well, or to reconstruct an existing well in a manner to
increase its maximum capacity over its maximum capacity on March 23, 2005, or
the most recent operation if the well was inoperable on March 23, 2005, or to
allow the development, digging, drilling or reconstruction of any well on land
located within the management zone.
   (C)   Application for permit. An application for a permit shall be filed by
the landowner or the applicant with the SBMWD on a form provided by SBMWD. The
applicant has an affirmative duty to provide accurate representations of all
material facts in the application.
   (D)   Contents of application for permit for extraction. The contents of the
application for permit for extraction shall include, as a minimum, all of the
items set forth in § 13.24.250 and the elevations of proposed screening
intervals, and such other information as SBMWD determines necessary and
appropriate to evaluate the application and assure that the proposed extraction
will not interfere with, compromise, endanger or detrimentally or adversely
affect the interim remedy or otherwise cause or contribute to the movement of
contaminants to areas downgradient of the inhibitor wells, or increase the
likelihood that contaminants will migrate past or around these wells, or
interfere with or adversely affect the interim remedy.
   (E)   Contents of application for permit for spreading. The contents of the
application for permit for spreading shall include, as a minimum, the name of
the person proposing to conduct the spreading; the time period over which the
spreading is proposed to occur; the volume, location and such other information
as SBMWD may determine necessary and appropriate to evaluate the application
and assure the proposed spreading will not interfere with, compromise, endanger
or detrimentally affect the interim remedy or otherwise cause or contribute to
the movement of contaminants to areas downgradient of the inhibitor wells.
   (F)   Fees. SBMWD may levy a fee for review of the application for permit
and monitoring of compliance with the permit. The fee shall be established by
resolution of the SBMWD Board of Water Commissioners.
   (G)   Exemption from permit and related requirements for institutional
controls ground water management program (“ICGMP”) members. By agreement
effective January 1, 2005, a number of local water agencies have entered into
the agreement entitled “Agreement to Develop and Adopt an Institutional
Controls Ground Water Management Program.” That program currently provides for
short-term restrictions on production and spreading to protect the interim
remedy while a long-term agreement is negotiated. The long-term agreement will
be as protective of the interim remedy as this chapter, and projects which are
subject to the ICGMP or successors to that agreement will be reviewed and
approved by the ICGMP parties pursuant to those agreements. As long as a party
proposing to construct or reconstruct a well or to spread water for artificial
recharge is a member in good standing of the ICGMP under the agreement
effective January 1, 2005, or successors to that agreement, that party’s
project(s) will be exempt from the provisions of this chapter and will be
reviewed and approved pursuant to the ICGMP or successors to that agreement
rather than this chapter. Compliance with ICGMP requirements shall be deemed to
be full compliance with this chapter. Non-compliance with ICGMP requirements
shall be addressed pursuant to remedies provided for in the ICGMP agreement or
successors to it. In the event the ICGMP expires or lapses while this chapter
is in force, or a party with an approved spreading or well project withdraws
from the ICGMP, any mitigation measures, project re-design measures, access and
monitoring requirements and parallel undertakings imposed or agreed to by the
party under the ICGMP shall become fully enforceable by the city under this
chapter.
   (H)   Review of application.
      (1)   The review process of the application will commence when SBMWD
determines it has received from the applicant all documents and necessary
information to commence its review.
      (2)   Subject to timely participation by EPA and DTSC, SBMWD shall
endeavor to complete the review within 120 days from notice by SBMWD to
applicant that the application is deemed complete.
      (3)   The completed application shall be subject to review and comment by
the EPA and DTSC. SBMWD shall provide to EPA and DTSC a copy of its proposed
decision, after which EPA and DTSC, pursuant to the consent decree, shall have
a minimum of 30 days to comment on the proposed decision. If either EPA or DTSC
object, in writing, to the permit application, proposed decision or modeling
work on which a proposed permit decision is based, the SBMWD, EPA and DTSC
shall consult for up to 60 days in order to resolve any material differences
among them over such matters. Consistent with the consent decree, the SBMWD
shall not issue a permit over the unresolved objections of either EPA or DTSC.
      (4)   Except as provided below, applications shall be evaluated using the
predictive particle tracking in order to determine if there is an adverse
effect. Once approved by EPA, the ground water model will be used for
predictive particle tracking, to forecast particle capture through a hydrologic
cycle reasonably representative of long-term hydrology lasting for at least the
proposed permit term, which hydrologic cycle shall include a wet cycle and a
dry cycle, based on historic hydrologic data for similar periods, and which
shall assume that the inhibitor wells are operated at design rates. Mitigation
measures and any project re-design are to be evaluated using the same method.
No proposed well construction or reconstruction, or future spreading operation,
shall be approved if the project is forecast to have an adverse effect unless
such adverse effect is eliminated through readily enforceable mitigation
measures or project re-design.
   (I)   Permit applications for extraction wells in plume areas and for
irrigation use on overlying land.
      (1)   Applications to drill in the areas shown on the attached map,
Exhibit C in Appendix A to this chapter, are strongly encouraged. The
boundaries of these areas correspond to the city’s estimates of areas within
the Newmark and Muscoy contaminant plumes where extraction and treatment of
water from these areas will slow the spread of contaminants.
      (2)   (a)   For wells proposed in the designated areas shown in the map,
the applicant and the city may use a streamlined modeling process, to be
developed by the city, to model the projected hydraulic impacts of the proposed
extraction well in the proposed location upon the operations of the inhibitor
wells.
         (b)   Such application shall clearly demonstrate that:
            1.   The well will conform to standards for structural integrity;
            2.   The water it produces will be properly treated; and
            3.   The well is screened at a depth and in such a manner that its
construction and operation will not cause the migration of contaminants between
different confined intervals of the aquifer.
      (3)   The city shall set the permit term for such wells in the designated
areas for not less than 15 years, with the option, in the city’s discretion, to
set the permit term for up to 30 years.
      (4)   Wells used by overlying landowners solely for non-potable
irrigation or solely for sand and gravel operations on such land may be
replaced on the same parcel without a permit under this chapter provided that
no such overlying landowner shall extract more than 250 acre feet per year from
the same or contiguous parcels without a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter.
      (5)   (a)   The city recognizes that the wells listed in Exhibit D in
Appendix A by assessor parcel number (“APN”) have been used by the overlying
landowners solely for non-potable irrigation on such land.
         (b)   These landowners may replace these wells on these properties
without making the modeling demonstration required by this chapter provided
that such applications clearly demonstrate that:
            1.   The water it produces will continue to be used only for non-
potable irrigation or sand and gravel operations on the land, or contiguous
parcels of the same landowner, where the well is located;
            2.   The well is constructed and screened in such a manner that it
will not cause migration of contaminants between different confined intervals
of the aquifer; provided, however, that if the replacement well is screened in
substantially the same interval as the well it replaces, the replacement well
shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of compliance with this
condition; and
            3.   That extractions shall not increase by more than 25% over the
maximum annual production and extraction rates for the last ten years, as shown
by contemporaneous documentary evidence or by an edison pump test and review of
electrical consumption.
§ 13.25.035 APPROVAL OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Standard of review. Except as provided above, a permit may be granted
for a period of up to 15 years with or without conditions under the provisions
of this chapter only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed extraction
or spreading and method of operation is not forecast to cause an adverse effect
when evaluated using the predictive particle tracking, and will not interfere
with, compromise, endanger or detrimentally affect the interim remedy, or cause
the city to be in potential violation or non-conformance with the SOW, consent
decree or RODs, or EPA or DTSC approved plans adopted thereunder.
      (1)   Prior to the completion of an updated ground water model, the
applicant shall bear the burden of demonstrating, through the use of
engineering and other satisfactory scientific data, that the proposed
extraction or spreading will not cause an adverse effect and will not interfere
with, compromise, endanger or detrimentally affect the interim remedy.
      (2)   After an updated model has been completed, the applicant shall bear
the burden of demonstrating through the use of the predictive particle tracking
and other satisfactory scientific evidence that the proposed extraction or
spreading is not forecast to cause an adverse effect, and will not interfere
with, compromise, endanger or detrimentally affect the interim remedy.
   (B)   Conditions of approval.
      (1)   In the event the application is approved, EPA, DTSC and SBMWD shall
have the right to condition approval upon mitigation measures, project re-
design or other remedial activities to be performed by applicant. EPA, DTSC or
SBMWD may require the applicant to prepare a mitigation or remedial plan,
subject to approval by EPA, DTSC and SBMWD, prior to issuance of the permit.
      (2)   If mitigation measures, project re-design or remedial activities
are required as a condition of the issuance of a permit, SBMWD may require
applicant to post a bond of sufficient value to assure compliance with the
mitigation or remedial activities.
      (3)   Upon approval of the application, with or without mitigation
measures, project re-design or remedial activities, and after the posting of a
bond, if required, SBMWD shall issue a permit.
      (4)   The approval and issuance of a permit shall be subject, at all
times, to the monitoring of applicant’s activities and suspension or revocation
of the permit if it is determined by SBMWD, EPA or DTSC that applicant’s
activities interfere with, compromise, endanger or detrimentally affect the
interim remedy.
      (5)   The issuance of a permit shall be conditioned on the grant to EPA,
DTSC and the city, including SBMWD, their contractors and representatives, of
access to the wells or spreading basins or related areas for the purpose of
verifying compliance with the permit, and upon reasonable notice to inspect and
copy documents and records of applicant’s operations of the permitted
facilities.
      (6)   Misrepresentation or failure to disclose material facts in the
application shall be grounds for denial of the application.
      (7)   The approval and issuance of a permit shall be conditioned upon
applicant indemnifying, defending and holding city and SBMWD harmless from any
and all claims, causes of action, injury to person or property and enforcement
proceedings arising from or related to the application for permit, property
subject to the permit, work to be undertaken relating to the permitted
property, including work not the subject of the permit or any other matter
related to the permit or granting of the permit, including, but not limited to,
any costs incurred by SBMWD or the city from any contest to the issuance of the
permit.
   (C)   Denial of application. SBMWD shall deny the application if it
determines that the standards of this chapter have not been attained or if
either SBMWD, EPA or DTSC determines that the proposed project is forecast to
cause an adverse effect which is not eliminated by mitigation measures or
project re-design or will interfere with or adversely affect the integrity of
the Newmark and Muscoy extraction and treatment systems, or will increase the
likelihood that contaminants will migrate past or around the barrier walls that
are part of those systems or will otherwise interfere with the performance of
the interim remedial actions, or cause the city to be in potential violation or
non-conformance with the SOW, consent decree or RODs, or any plan approved by
EPA or DTSC in order to implement those documents. SBMWD shall provide to
applicant a copy of the written objections made together with any additional
written statement of reasons by EPA, DTSC and/or SBMWD for disapproval of the
permit. An applicant denied a permit may appeal the decision pursuant to §
13.25.060.
§ 13.25.040 REPORTING.
   (A)   Reporting by applicants. A condition of each and every permit shall be
the requirement that the applicant provide, at least quarterly, regular written
reports to SBMWD of water levels, chemistry and other information affecting
water quality deemed appropriate by SBMWD. The SBMWD may specify forms for such
reports and such forms shall be used by applicant to comply with the provisions
of this section. Such reports shall require applicant to perform monitoring,
sampling and record-keeping of any wells that are the subject of the permit,
including the amount, rate and timing of extraction or spreading and the
quality of water being extracted or spread, including, but not limited to,
concentrations of perchloroethylene (“PCE”), trichloroethylene (“TCE”), freon
and other water quality related concentrations, specified by SBMWD. Upon
receipt of any report requested or required by this chapter, SBMWD may require
a follow-up report of additional data and/or information. Applicant shall keep
records of all activities relating to the operation of wells and/or spreading
activities, including all sampling results and flow data. Such records shall be
available for inspection and copying by SBMWD, EPA and DTSC upon 48 hours’
notice. These records shall be maintained for a period of not less than five
years. The period for retention of records shall automatically be extended for
any period of litigation between SBMWD, the city, EPA and/or DTSC and the
applicant.
   (B)   Reporting by non-applicants. Every person, except parties to the ICGMP
described in §
13.25.025(G), spreading or extracting more than 250 acre-feet in any month,
shall report the amount of such spreading or extraction to the city within 90
days of the close of the calendar year quarter in which such spreading or
extraction occurred. Said report shall be submitted under penalty of perjury.
The SBMWD may specify forms for such reports and such reports shall be used to
comply with the provisions of this section.
§ 13.25.045 REVOCATION AND EMERGENCY POWERS.
   (A)   If there is an immediate and serious threat to the interim remedy, and
its performance in accordance with the SOW, consent decree or RODs, and if
SBMWD believes it may be due in whole or in part to applicant’s operations,
SBMWD may order the applicant to cease or reduce its operations and show cause
why the permit should not be revoked, modified or restricted.
   (B)   In addition to the provisions set forth above, the permit may be
revoked upon the determination of the SBMWD General Manager of any of the
following:
      (1)   Misrepresentation or failure to disclose material facts in the
application;
      (2)   Falsifying or making misrepresentations on any reports submitted to
SBMWD, whether as part of the application, as a condition of the permit or as
submitted voluntarily by the applicant;
      (3)   Tampering with monitoring equipment subject to the permit;

their designees’, timely access to the permitted sites and operations, and
records of those operations;
      (5)   Failure to pay fines;
      (6)   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to comply with conditions of approval; and
      (8)   Failure to file timely reports or to respond to requests for
reports, sampling data, monitoring activities or cooperation with the interim
remedy for the Newmark Superfund Site.
   (C)   In the event the activities of the applicant, or applicant’s agents,
contractors, licensees, lessees or employees are deemed by SBMWD to interfere
with or adversely affect the integrity of the Newmark and Muscoy extraction and
treatment systems, or will increase the likelihood that contaminants will
migrate past or around the barrier wells that are part of those systems or will
otherwise interfere with the performance of the interim remedy, SBMWD may
revoke or suspend the permit and compel applicant to cease all activities
covered by the permit until either a hearing is held before the Board of Water
Commissioners, pursuant to §
13.25.060, for applicant to demonstrate why the permit should not be modified
or revoked, or the applicant and the General Manager reach a mutually
acceptable resolution. In all other circumstances, the applicant shall be
advised in writing of any non-compliance with the permit or other condition
that may warrant a modification of permit conditions or revocation of the
permit, and the applicant shall be afforded the opportunity for a hearing
before the Board of Water Commissioners, pursuant to the provisions of §
13.25.060, to present any evidence as to why the permit should not be modified
or revoked.
§ 13.25.047 INTERFERENCE BY EXISTING WELLS WITH CONSENT DECREE OR SOW.
   In the event an existing well, not subject to the permit requirements of
this chapter, is operated in a manner which materially interferes with the
city’s compliance with the provisions of the consent decree or SOW, or requires
an increase in operating rates above design rate in order to maintain
compliance with the requirements of the consent decree or SOW, the city may
halt, abate or reduce such activities by injunction from the County Superior
Court, or by the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, acting pursuant to the United States District Court’s retention of
jurisdiction over institutional controls in paragraph 1.b, page 11, lines 6
through 19 of the consent decree. This provision is in addition to, and not in
derogation of, the city’s other statutory, equitable and common law remedies.
§ 13.25.050 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The SBMWD may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance
or similar arrangements establishing an agreement with any person responsible
for non-compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Such arrangements will
include specific action to be taken by the person to correct any non-compliance
and shall be enforceable in a court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 13.25.055 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   If SBMWD finds that a person has violated any provision of this chapter, or
a permit, or the person’s activities pose an immediate and serious threat to
the interim remedy, and that it is likely the person will continue with such
violation or detrimental activities, SBMWD may issue an administrative order
directing such person immediately to cease and desist from such conduct and to
take all actions necessary to comply fully with the order. If the person fails
immediately to comply with such an administrative order, that person shall be
subject to criminal and civil liability in addition to whatever civil liability
the person may have been subject to as a result of the conduct that prompted
the issuance of the cease and desist order.
§ 13.25.060 HEARING PROCEDURES AND APPEALS.
   (A)   In the event SBMWD denies an application, imposes or materially
modifies a condition of approval that is/are unacceptable to the applicant or
suspends or revokes a permit, an appeal may be commenced by the applicant.
   (B)   All appeals must be filed in the office of the SBMWD General Manager
within 15 days of any denial, approval with conditions, suspension or
revocation. The appeal filed with SBMWD shall include the name of the
applicant; name, address and telephone number of the person representing
applicant; assessor’s parcel number (“APN”) or other description of property
involved; any identifying case number or application number issued by SBMWD;
the basis for the appeal; the date and signature of the applicant.
   (C)   All appeals shall be heard by the SBMWD Board of Water Commissioners
during its regular meetings. The burden of proof at such hearing shall be upon

size, to be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
   (C)   The notice given by the City Engineer to provide the required
underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is required to be
done, and shall state that, if the work is not completed within 30 days after
receipt of such notice, the City Engineer will provide such required
underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof will be
assessed against the property benefitted and become a lien upon such property.
   (D)   If upon the expiration of the 30-day period, the required underground
facilities have not been provided, the city, by order of the Mayor and upon
issuance of a work order, shall forthwith proceed to cause the work to be done;
provided, however, if such premises are unoccupied and no electric or
communications services are being furnished thereto, the city shall, in lieu of
providing the required underground facilities, have the authority to order the
disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated
facilities supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the
work, the City Engineer shall file a written report with the City Council
setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been
provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the
property against which such cost is to be assessed. The Council shall thereupon

Council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such
assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed

property against which the assessment is made by the City Engineer, and the
City Engineer is directed to turn over to the assessor and tax collector a
notice of lien on each of the properties on which the assessment has not been
paid, and the assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of the assessment
to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises upon which the
assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be due and payable at the same
time as the property taxes are due and payable, and if not paid when due and
payable, shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per year.

   It is unlawful for any person to construct, install, maintain or operate a
cable television system within any street or public way in the city without
first obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this article or, if
applicable, under the provisions of the Digital Infrastructure and Video
Competition Act of 2006; provided, however, that any cable operator authorized
to provide cable service under a franchise granted by the city prior to the
effective date of this chapter may continue to exercise that authority until
the expiration or termination of that franchise.
Statutory reference:
   Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006, see Cal. Stats

§§ 5800 et seq.
§ 14.08.05 CITY GRANTS OF CABLE FRANCHISES.
   Subject to applicable law, the city may, by ordinance or resolution, grant a
franchise to any person, whether or not operating under an existing franchise,
or who elects to provide cable service pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter. The franchise shall be subject to all ordinances and regulations of
general application now in effect or subsequently enacted, including, without
limitation, those related to encroachment permits, business licenses, zoning
and building.
§ 14.08.06 FRANCHISE DURATION AND RENEWAL.
   (A)   The term of the franchise or of any franchise renewal shall be
established in the franchise agreement.
   (B)   A franchise may be renewed by the city upon application of the grantee
pursuant to procedures established by the city, subject to applicable federal
and state law. In the event the city does not establish such renewal
procedures, the franchise renewal procedures set forth in federal law shall
apply.
§ 14.08.07 LIMITATIONS OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   A franchise granted under this chapter shall be non-exclusive.
   (B)   The grant of a franchise, right or license to use public rights-of-way
for purposes of providing cable service shall not be construed as a right or
license to use such public rights-of-way for any other purpose.
   (C)   Any right or privilege claimed by a grantee under a franchise in
public rights-of-way or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior
or subsequent lawful occupancy or use thereof, or easement therein, by the city
or other governmental entity.
   (D)   A franchise granted under this chapter shall not relieve a grantee of
any obligation to obtain pole space from any city department, utility company
or others maintaining poles in the public rights-of-way.
§ 14.08.08 RIGHTS RESERVED TO THE CITY.
   (A)   Subject to any restrictions that are mandated by state or federal law,
neither the granting of any franchise nor any provisions of this chapter shall
be construed to preclude the city from granting additional franchises.
   (B)   By its acceptance of a franchise, a grantee agrees to comply with all
lawful ordinances and regulations of general application now in effect or
subsequently enacted; provided, however, that such ordinances and regulations
shall not materially affect grantee’s rights or obligations under the
franchise.
   (C)   Neither the granting of a franchise, nor any provisions of this
chapter, shall constitute a waiver or bar to the city’s lawful exercise of any
governmental right or power.
   (D)   This chapter shall not be construed to impair or affect, in any way,
the right of the city to acquire the grantee’s property through the exercise of
the power of eminent domain, in accordance with applicable law.
   (E)   The Mayor and City Council may do all things necessary in the exercise
of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may determine any question of fact
that may arise during the term of any franchise granted under this chapter.
   (F)   Any right or power in, or duty imposed upon, any officer, employee,
department or board of the city shall be subject to transfer by the city to any
other officer, employee, department or board of the city.
(Ord. MC-1484, passed 4-18-2018)
§ 14.08.09 TRANSFERS AND ASSIGNMENTS.
   (A)   Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of,
in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale,
contract, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or
privileges therein granted, without the prior written consent of the Mayor and
City Council. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose
of the franchise without the written consent of the Mayor and City Council is
null and void. The granting of a security interest in any assets of the
grantee, or any mortgage or other hypothecation, will not be deemed a transfer
for the purposes of this section.
   (B)   The requirements of division (A) above apply to any change in control
of the grantee. The word “control,” as used herein, is not limited to the
ownership of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual
working control in whatever manner exercised. If the grantee is a partnership
or a corporation, prior authorization of the city is required where ownership
or control of 25% or more of the partnership interests or of the voting stock
of the corporation, or any company in the tier of companies controlling the
grantee, whether directly or indirectly, is acquired by a person or a group of
persons acting in concert, none of whom, individually or collectively, owns or
controls those partnership interests or that voting stock of the grantee, or
the grantee’s upper tier of controlling companies, as of the effective date of
the franchise.
   (C)   Unless precluded by federal law, the grantee must give prior written
notice to the city of any proposed foreclosure or judicial sale of all or a
substantial part of the grantee’s franchise property. That notification will be
considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the
franchise will take place, and the provisions of this section that require the
prior written consent of the Mayor and City Council to that change in control
of ownership will apply.
   (D)   For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an
acquisition, transfer or change in control, the city may inquire about the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the
grantee must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city’s consent to
any change of ownership or control, the grantee or the proposed transferee, or
both, must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its
equivalent. This application must be submitted to the city not less than 120
days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that
it possesses the legal, financial and technical capability to remedy all then-
existing defaults and deficiencies, and during the remaining term of the
franchise, to operate and maintain the cable system and to comply with all
franchise requirements. If the legal, financial and technical qualifications of
the proposed transferee are determined to be satisfactory, then the city will
consent to the transfer of the franchise.
   (E)   Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee’s assets to
secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the franchise
property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee satisfactory
to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television system upon
the grantee’s default in its financial obligations. Further, that financial
institution must also submit a plan for such operation within 90 days after
assuming control. The plan must ensure continued service and compliance with
all franchise requirements during the period that the financial institution
will exercise control over the system. The financial institution may not
exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless
authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period, it will
have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another
grantee.
   (F)   Unless prohibited by applicable law, the grantee must reimburse the
city for the city’s reasonable review and processing expenses incurred in
connection with any transfer or change in control of the franchise, as provided
for in §
14.08.15.
(Ord. MC-1484, passed 4-18-2018)
§ 14.08.10 FRANCHISE SERVICE AREA; ANNEXATIONS.
   (A)   The franchise service area shall be established in the franchise
agreement.
   (B)   Territory annexed to the city that is not within the service area of a
franchised or licensed cable operator at the time of annexation may be included
within the franchise service area of an incumbent cable operator, as determined
by Mayor and City Council resolution.
   (C)   Territory annexed to the city that is included within the service area
of a franchise or license issued by a local franchising authority other than
the city is subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   If the franchisee or licensee has not commenced construction or
installation of a cable system before the annexation becomes effective, then
all rights acquired by a cable operator under that franchise or license will
terminate by operation of law.
      (2)   If the franchisee or licensee has commenced construction or
installation of a cable system before the annexation becomes effective, then
that franchisee or licensee may continue to provide cable service to the
annexed territory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the existing
franchise or license; provided that all obligations thereunder, including the
timely payment of franchise fees and PEG support fees, if any, shall be due and
owing to the city by operation of law.

written decision on whether the franchise should be granted, and if granted,
subject to what conditions.
   (D)   In determining whether to grant an application for a new franchise,
the city may consider all factors that affect the interests of the community,

applicant shall pay such additional costs to the city within 30 days after
written notice from the city that such additional payment is required. If
payment of such amount is not made within such time, the city shall cease all
further proceedings related to the application. If actual costs are less than

§ 14.08.16 FRANCHISE FEE FOR CABLE SERVICES.
   (A)   In consideration for the privilege to use the city’s public rights-of-

revenues, unless a greater amount is authorized by applicable law.
   (B)   The franchise fee shall be paid quarterly and must be received by the
city not later than 45 days after the close of each calendar quarter.
   (C)   Concurrently with the payment of franchise fees, the grantee shall

shall have 30 days to notify the grantee and to request additional information.
The grantee shall have 30 days to provide additional information to resolve any
objections to the city’s satisfaction.

right to conduct, or require the grantee to obtain, an independent audit by
certified public accountants approved by the city of all records of the grantee

costs of that audit. The grantee shall cooperate with any such audit and shall
make readily available all information requested by the city without regard as
to whether information is contained in documents (as defined in the Public
Records Act) or other media in the possession or under the control of the
grantee.
      (2)   The certified public accountants shall be required to certify in
the audit that the grantee is in compliance with this chapter and the franchise
agreement. The grantee shall maintain, in a readily accessible place, all
relevant financial records for a minimum of four years after any payment period
that such records pertain to.
   (F)   If any franchise fee payment is not made by the due date, interest
shall be charged monthly at a rate of 1%. In addition, if any franchise fee is
not paid in full within 15 days after the grantee’s receipt of notice from the
city concerning the delinquency of that payment, a late fee in the amount of 5%

(Ord. MC-1484, passed 4-18-2018)
§ 14.08.20 REVIEW OF APPLICATION.
   Within 30 days after receipt of an application filed under §
14.08.19 that is deemed to be complete, the City Manager will give written
notice to the applicant of the city’s intent to negotiate an agreement setting
forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open
video system will be authorized by the city. The commencement of those
negotiations will be on a date that is mutually acceptable to the city and to
the applicant.
§ 14.08.21 AGREEMENT REQUIRED.
   (A)   No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open
video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written
agreement, which may be designated as a franchise, setting forth the terms and
conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be
authorized by the city.
   (B)   The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may
contain terms and conditions that relate to the following subject matters, to
the extent that such terms, conditions and subject matters are not preempted by
federal statute or regulations:
      (1)   The nature, scope and duration of the agreement, including
provisions for its renewal or extension;
      (2)   The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the
city, at specified times, fees on the gross revenue received by the operator,
as authorized by 47 C.F.R. § 76.1511, in accordance with the following
standards and procedures.
         (a)   The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be 5%, and will
be paid in lieu of the franchise fees authorized under § 622 of the
Communications Act, being 47 U.S.C. § 542.
         (b)   The term GROSS REVENUE means:
             1.   All gross revenue received by an open video system operator
or its affiliates, including all revenues received from subscribers and all
carriage revenues received from unaffiliated video programming providers; and
            2.   All advertising revenues received by the operator or its
affiliates in connection with the provision of video programming, where such
revenues are included in the calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the
city by the franchised cable operator. The term GROSS REVENUE does not include
revenue, such as subscriber or advertising revenue, collected by unaffiliated
video programming providers.
      (3)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with
requirements relating to information collection and record-keeping, accounting
procedures, reporting, periodic audits and inspection of records in order to
ensure the accuracy of the fees on the OVS gross revenue that are required to
be paid as specified above in division (B)(2) above;
      (4)   The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city’s
requirements with respect to PEG access facilities, as provided for in 47
C.F.R. § 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are
applicable.
         (a)   The open video system operator is subject to the same PEG access
channel requirements that apply within the cable television franchise service
area with which its system overlaps.
         (b)   The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers
receive all PEG access channels within the franchise service area in which the
city’s subscribers are located.
         (c)   The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to
establish the operator’s obligations with respect to PEG access facilities.
These negotiations may include the city’s franchised cable operator if the
city, the open video system operator and the franchised cable operator so
desire.
         (d)   If the open video system operator and the city are unable to
reach an agreement regarding the operator’s obligations with respect to public,
educational and government access channel capacity, services, facilities and
equipment within the city’s jurisdiction, then the following obligations will
be imposed.
            1.   The open video system operator must satisfy the same PEG
access channel obligations as the city’s franchised cable operator by providing
the same amount of channel capacity for PEG access and by matching the city’s
franchised cable operator’s annual financial contributions in support of
public, educational and government access services, facilities and equipment
that are actually used by the city. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras
or production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory
obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city’s franchised
cable operator, so that PEG access services to the city are improved or
increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the open video system operator
must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the franchised cable operator’s
depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of facilities, the annual
amortization value. Any matching contributions provided by the open video
system operator must be used to fund activities arising under § 611 of the
Communications Act, being 47 U.S.C. § 531.
            2.   The city will impose upon the open video system operator the
same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator
with regard to the open video system operator’s use of channel capacity
designated for PEG access channel use when that capacity is not being used for
such purposes.
         (e)   The city’s franchised cable operator is required under federal
law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its PEG access
channel feeds. The open video system operator and the franchised cable operator
may decide how to accomplish this connection, taking into consideration the
physical and technical characteristics of the cable and the open video systems
involved. If the franchised cable operator and the open video system operator
cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to
decide. The city may require that the connection occur on city owned property
or on public rights-of-way.
         (f)   All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator’s PEG
access channel feed must be borne by the open video system operator. These
costs will be counted towards the open video system operator’s matching
financial contributions set forth above in division (B)(4)(d)1. above.
         (g)   The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any
public, educational or government access channel obligations that are more
favorable or less burdensome than those imposed upon the franchised cable
operator.
         (h)   If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the
provisions of 47 C.F.R. § 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the
obligations of the open video system operator.
         (i)   The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply
with new public, educational, governmental and access channel obligations
imposed on the city’s franchised cable operator following a renewal of the
cable television franchise; provided, however, that the open video system
operator will not be required to displace other programmers using its open
video system to accommodate PEG access channels. The open video system operator
must comply with such new PEG access channel obligations whenever additional
capacity is or becomes available, whether it is due to increased channel
capacity or to decreased demand for channel capacity.
      (5)   If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree on the
application of the FCC’s rules regarding the open video system operator’s
obligations to provide PEG access under the provisions of division (B)(4)
above, then either party may file a complaint with the FCC in accordance with
the dispute resolution procedures set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 76.1514. No
agreement will be executed by the city until the dispute has been finally
resolved;
      (6)   If the open video system operator intends to maintain an
institutional network, as defined in § 611(f) of the Communications Act, being
47 U.S.C. § 531(f), the city will require that educational and government
access channels be designated on that institutional network to the same extent
that those channels are designated on the institutional network of the city’s
franchised cable operator. In addition, to the extent authorized by federal
law, the open video system operator may be required by the city to satisfy the
same financial obligations and other requirements that are imposed upon the
franchised cable operator to support data-transmission and related services
that are provided by the institutional network;
      (7)   The authority of an open video system provider to exercise
editorial control over any public, educational or government use of channel
capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 C.F.R. §
76.1505(f);
      (8)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all
applicable federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations,
relating to customer service standards, including the Cable Television and
Video Provider Customer Service and Information Act (Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 53054
et seq.); the Video Customer Service Act (Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 53088 et seq.);
and the consumer protection and service standards of this chapter, commencing
with §
14.08.22;
      (9)   If new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the
city, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the
following rights-of-way use and management responsibilities that are also
imposed by the city upon other telecommunications service providers in a non-
discriminatory and competitively neutral manner:
         (a)   Compliance with all applicable city laws, including applications
for excavation, encroachment and construction permits and the payment of all
required permit and inspection fees;
         (b)   The coordination of construction activities;
         (c)   Compliance with established standards and procedures for
constructing lines across private property;
         (d)   Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification
requirements;
         (e)   The repair and resurfacing of construction-damaged streets; and
         (f)   Compliance with all public safety requirements that are
applicable to telecommunications service providers using public property or
public rights-of-way.
      (10)   Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the
agreement, and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages and other remedies,
including fines or the suspension, revocation or termination of the agreement;
      (11)   Requirements relating to the sale, assignment or transfer of the
open video system;
      (12)   Requirements relating to the open video system operator’s
compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules and
regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video system; and
      (13)   Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies and
procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system
operator and that will, in the judgment of the Mayor and City Council, best
serve the public interest and protect the public health, welfare and safety.
ARTICLE IV. OTHER VIDEO AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND SYSTEMS
§ 14.08.22 OTHER MULTI-CHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS.
   The term CABLE SYSTEM does not include a facility that serves subscribers
without using any public rights-of-way. Consequently, the categories of multi-
channel video programming distributors identified below are not deemed to be
CABLE SYSTEMS and are, therefore, exempt from the city’s franchise requirements
and from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law;
provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the
use of the city’s public rights-of-way.
   (A)   MULTI-CHANNEL MULTI-POINT DISTRIBUTION SERVICE (“MMDS”), also known as
WIRELESS CABLE, which typically involves the transmission by an FCC-licensed
operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line-of-
sight technology.
   (B)   LOCAL MULTI-POINT DISTRIBUTION SERVICE (“LMDS”), another form of over-
the-air, wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC and
that offers video programming, telephone and data networking services.
   (C)   DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE (“DBS”), also referred to as DIRECT-TO-HOME
SATELLITE SERVICES, which involves the distribution or broadcasting of
programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber’s premises
without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the
subscriber’s premises or in the up-link process to the satellite. Local
regulation of direct-to-home satellite services is further proscribed by the
following federal statutory provisions.
      (1)   47 U.S.C. § 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to
regulate the provisions of direct-to-home satellite services.
      (2)   Section 602 of the Communications Act, being 47 U.S.C. § 522,
states that a provider of direct-to-home satellite service is exempt from the
collection or remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local
taxing jurisdiction on direct-to-home satellite service. The terms TAX and FEE
are defined by federal statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax,
local intangible tax, local income tax, business license tax, utility tax,
privilege tax, gross receipts tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local
telecommunications tax or any other tax, license or fee that is imposed for the
privilege of doing business, regulating or raising revenue for a local taxing
jurisdiction.

effective date of this chapter, and are not required under applicable law to
operate under a franchise, license, lease or similar written agreement with the
city, must register with the city.

payment, a registration fee in an amount established by resolution of the Mayor
and City Council to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the city in
reviewing and processing the registration form; and
         (e)   In addition to the registration fee specified above in division

such outage to the provider, except in those situations beyond the reasonable
control of the video provider. A video provider will be deemed to respond to a
complete outage when a company representative arrives at the outage location
within 24 hours and begins to resolve the problem.
      (8)   All video providers must provide a minimum of 30 days’ written
notice before increasing rates or deleting channels. All video providers must
make every reasonable effort to submit the notice to the city in advance of the

rates or deletion of channels are outside the control of the video provider. In
those cases, the video provider must make reasonable efforts to provide
customers with as much notice as possible.
      (9)   Every video provider must allow every residential customer who pays
his or her bill directly to the video provider at least 15 days from the date

notice must be mailed, postage prepaid, to the customer to whom the service is
billed. Notice must not be mailed until the sixteenth day after the date the
bill for services was mailed to the customer. The notice of delinquency and
impending termination may be part of a billing statement. Additionally, no
video provider may assess a late fee any earlier than the twenty-second day

division (C)(9) above, must include all of the following information:
         (a)   The name and address of the customer whose account is
delinquent;
         (b)   The amount of the delinquency;
         (c)   The date by which payment is required in order to avoid

provided to the subscriber a notice, separate or included in any other customer
notice, that clearly and conspicuously describes the subscriber’s ability to
prohibit the disclosure. Video providers must provide an address and telephone
number for a local subscriber to use without toll charge to prevent disclosure
of the subscriber’s name and address.
   (D)   As authorized by Cal. Gov’t Code, § 53088.2(r), the following schedule
of penalties is adopted. These penalties may be imposed for the material breach
by a video provider of the consumer protection and service standards that are
set forth in division (C) above; provided that the breach is within the
reasonable control of the video provider. These penalties are in addition to
any other remedies authorized by this chapter or by any other law, and the city
has discretion to elect the remedy that it will apply. The imposition of
penalties authorized by this division (D) will not prevent the city or any
other affected party from exercising any other remedy to the extent permitted
by law, including, but not limited to, any judicial remedy as provided in
division (D)(2) below.
      (1)   Schedule of penalties.
         (a)   For a first material breach: the maximum penalty is $200 for
each day of material breach, but not to exceed a cumulative total of $600 for
each occurrence of material breach, irrespective of the number of customers
affected;
         (b)   For a second material breach of the same nature for which a
monetary penalty was previously assessed within the preceding 12-month period:

number of customers affected; and
         (d)   The maximum penalties referenced above may be increased by any
additional amount authorized by state law.
      (2)   Judicial remedies not affected. The imposition of penalties in
accordance with the provisions of division (D)(1) above do not preclude any
affected party from pursuing any judicial remedy that is available to that
party.
      (3)   Administration, notice and appeal.
         (a)   The City Manager is authorized to administer this division (D).

§ 14.08.24 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDED BY TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS.
   Any video programming provided by a telephone corporation that uses public
rights-of-way in the delivery of that video programming, regardless of the
technology used, will be considered a cable service under this chapter unless
such programming is otherwise expressly authorized by state or federal law.
   (A)   In recognition of and in compliance with statutory requirements that
are set forth in state law, the following regulatory provisions are applicable
to a telephone corporation that desires to provide telecommunications service
by means of facilities that are proposed to be constructed within the city’s
public rights-of-way.
      (1)   The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be
applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit or a building permit
(“ministerial permit”).
      (2)   In addition to the information required by this chapter, in
connection with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone
corporation must submit to the city the following supplemental information:
         (a)   A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity
issued by the State Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) to the applicant, and
a copy of the CPUC decision that authorizes the applicant to provide the
telecommunications service for which the facilities are proposed to be
constructed in the city’s public rights-of-way; and
         (b)   If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of
public convenience to operate as a “competitive local carrier,” the following
additional requirements are applicable.
            1.   As required by the CPUC, the applicant must establish that it
has filed with the city, in a timely manner, a quarterly report that describes
the type of construction and the location of each construction project proposed
to be undertaken in the city during the calendar quarter in which the
application is filed, which information is sufficient to enable the city to
coordinate multiple projects, as may be necessary.
            2.   If the applicant’s proposed construction project will extend
beyond the utility rights-of-way into undisturbed areas or other rights-of-way,
the applicant must establish that it has filed a petition with the CPUC to
amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed
construction project has been subjected to a full-scale environmental analysis
by the CPUC, as required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.
            3.   The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed
construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures
specified in the negative declaration (“Competitive Local Carriers (“CLCs”)
Projects for Local Exchange Communication Service throughout California”) or to
the mitigation monitoring plan adopted in connection with Decision No. 95-12-
057 of the CPUC. The city’s issuance of a ministerial permit will be
conditioned upon the applicant’s compliance with all applicable mitigation
measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone
corporations that are designated as “competitive local carriers.”
   (B)   In recognition of the fact that numerous excavations in the public
rights-of-way diminish the useful life of the surface pavement, and for the
purpose of mitigating the adverse impacts of numerous excavations on the
quality and longevity of public street maintenance within the city, the
following policies and procedures are adopted.
      (1)   The City Manager is directed to ensure that all public utilities,
including telephone corporations, comply with all local design, construction,
maintenance and safety standards that are contained within, or are related to,
a ministerial permit that authorizes the construction of facilities within the
public rights-of-way.
      (2)   The City Manager is directed to coordinate the construction and
installation of facilities by public utilities, including telephone
corporations, in order to minimize the number of excavations in the public
rights-of-way. In this regard, based upon projected plans for street
construction or renovation projects, the City Manager is authorized to
establish, on a quarterly basis, one or more construction time periods or
“windows” for the installation of facilities within the public rights-of-way.
Telephone corporations and other public utilities that submit applications for
ministerial permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may be
required to delay such construction until the next quarterly “window” that is
established by the city.
   (C)   Subject to applicable provisions of state and federal law, any video
programming provided by a telephone corporation that uses public rights-of-way
in the transmission or delivery of that video programming, regardless of the
technology used, will be deemed to be a video service subject to the franchise
requirements set forth in §
14.08.04.
   (D)   Telephone corporations that apply for and receive a state franchise to
provide video service within all or any part of the city must comply with the
provisions of this title, and all applicable provisions of the Digital
Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 (Division 2.5 of the Cal.
Public Utilities Code, commencing with § 5800).
§ 14.08.25 PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT FEE (“PEG FEE”) AND
REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE PEG CHANNELS.
   (A)   PEG fee. A fee of 1% of gross revenues shall be assessed on all video
service providers that use the public rights-of-way, including all local
franchisees and all holders of state franchises as consistent with state or
federal law. The PEG fee shall be paid quarterly, to be received by the city
not later than 45 days after the close of each quarter of grantee’s fiscal
year.
      (1)   On a quarterly basis, the grantee shall provide the city a complete
and accurate statement verified by a financial officer of the grantee
indicating gross revenues for the past quarter, listing every revenue source
and depicting gross revenue computations.
      (2)   A video service provider subject to this section may recover the
amount of any fee by billing a recovery fee as a separate line item on the
regular bill of each subscriber.
   (B)   Channel designation. All video service providers that use the public
rights-of-way shall designate sufficient amount of capacity on its network to
allow the carriage of at least three public, educational or governmental access
(“PEG”) channels. For the purposes of this section, a PEG channel is deemed
activated if it is being utilized for PEG programming within the city for at
least eight hours per day.
      (1)   PEG channels shall be for the exclusive use of the city or its
designee to provide public, educational or governmental channels.
      (2)   Advertising, underwriting or sponsorship recognition may be carried
on the channels for the purpose of funding PEG-related activities.
      (3)   The PEG channels shall all be carried on the basic service tier of
the grantee.
      (4)   To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated
numerically from other channels carried on the basic service tier and the
channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by
the incumbent cable operator unless prohibited by federal law.
      (5)   After the initial designation of PEG channel numbers, the channel
numbers shall not be changed without the agreement of the city unless the
change is required by federal law.
      (6)   Each channel shall be capable of carrying a National Television
System Committee (“NTSC”) television signal.
   (C)   Interconnection. Where technically feasible, all grantee’s video
service providers shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks
for the purpose of providing PEG programming. Interconnection may be
accomplished by direct cable, microwave link, satellite or other reasonable
method of connection. Holders of a state franchise and incumbent cable
operators shall provide interconnection of the PEG channels on reasonable terms
and conditions and may not withhold the interconnection. If a holder of a state
franchise and an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable
interconnection agreement, the city may require the incumbent cable operator to
allow the holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent’s network at a
technically feasible point on the holder’s network as identified by the holder.
If no technically feasible point for interconnection is available, the holder
of a state franchise shall make an interconnection available to the channel
originator and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection.
The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the holder of a state
franchise requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties.

aforesaid being obtained. Requests for the certificate shall be made by the

   (A)   Vacant and abandoned buildings shall be boarded pursuant to the
following guidelines, which are modeled after, in part, guidelines of the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
      (1)   Board requirements.
         (a)   All first floor windows and doors and all basement windows and
doors should have plywood covering the entire opening and frame.
         (b)   The covering should be secured with carriage bolts.
         (c)   Any health and safety hazard caused by any protruding bolts used
to secure boarding must be eliminated.
         (d)   The use of nails is prohibited.
         (e)   There shall be no boarding above the first floor unless entry is
possible without use of a ladder, and the opening is large enough for a person
to easily pass through; openings above the first floor that do not meet this
test should be secured but not boarded.
         (f)   If security bars are located on windows/doors, boarding is not
required.
         (g)   Openings too small for a person to pass through, particularly
pet openings in doors, should be secured but not boarded.
         (h)   To ensure that no hazards exist, remove all broken glass from
the windows and surrounding interior and exterior areas.
      (2)   Specifications for plywood boarding.
         (a)   Exterior plywood should be of un-sanded CDX grade.
         (b)   Plywood thickness should be one-half-inch for window openings,
five-eighths-inch for door openings and three-fourths inch for sliding door and
French door openings. When extra large window openings are encountered, use
five-eighths-inch or three-fourths-inch, as necessary.
         (c)   All holes should be drilled to accommodate bolts. The holes in
the top of the plywood should be 12 inches down from the top and 20% of the
width of the plywood cover, in from the side.
         (d)   The holes in the bottom should be 25% of the height of the
plywood, up from the bottom and the same distance in from the side as the top.
         (e)   Carriage bolts mated with nut and two three-inch flat washers as
shown in the side view. Washers to be of sufficient size to fully accept the
square portion of bolt beneath head. Bolt and mating hardware may be galvanized
or cadmium plated. Three-eighths-inch by 12-inch bolts should be supplied with
each two-foot, eight-inch door; three-foot door; and glass sliding door cover.
Three-eighths by ten-inch bolts should be supplied with the rest.
         (f)   Two-inch by four-inch lumber should be graded and should be a
minimum of 16 inches longer than the width of the plywood cover. (Note: two by
fours will be drilled with one-half-inch diameter holes that line up with the
holes in the plywood covers.)
         (g)   All windows and doors, except the front door, through which
access to the interior of the dwelling is made, should be secured. All window
boards will be cut to fit inside the concrete block or brick opening with a
maximum one-eighth-inch clearance. The plywood covering should be of one
continuous piece when possible.
         (h)   All fabricated parts and ancillary materials become property of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
         (i)   All coverings are to be fabricated according to the attached
drawing and specifications.
      (3)   Boarding windows.
         (a)   Except as noted below, all window sashes, frames, glass and
hardware are to be undamaged by the boarding installation.
         (b)   All screen inserts are to be removed, marked as to location and
stored in a convenient closet or in the utility room.
         (c)   In all cases where it is possible to adjust the position of the
sashes to accommodate the specifications for boarding above, the sashes are to
remain in the frame.
         (d)   In instances wherein the sashes cannot be adjusted to
accommodate the boarding specifications above, the sashes are to be removed
from the frames and stored in a convenient closet or in the utility room. This
includes all stationary lights secured by stops.
         (e)   In cases wherein the sash cannot be removed and/or the frame is
permanently built into the house and cannot be removed (i.e., Fenestra
windows), it will be necessary to break the corner panes to accommodate the
boarding and bolts. If the location of bolt holes, in the plywood, requires
modification because of the muntin bar (a small bar that divides a windows
glass), these locations are to be modified. In no case, in any type of window,
is any sash or frame part to be damaged.
         (f)   In all instances where items should be removed from the frame
and stored, the items should be clearly marked as to the area from which it was
removed.
         (g)   All items are to be stored on edge and braced to prevent
accidental tipping, sliding and the like. In no instance is any item to be
stored laid flat.
         (h)   Hinged windows are to be completely removed from the frame and
stored as stated in (A)(3)(g) above. If possible, the hinge pins are to be
removed and remain with the removed item.
         (i)   Faced nailing of panels to wood frame windows is prohibited.
   (B)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be

§ 15.08.010 FINDINGS.
   Local governing bodies are required to adopt policies for the protection of
the community against geologic and seismic hazards, pursuant to Cal. Gov’t
Code, § 65302. The primary geologic and seismic hazards that could potentially
affect the city include fault rupture, ground shaking, historic high ground
water and soil matrix. These hazards could cause liquefaction resulting in
extensive property damage and loss of life in susceptible areas of the city.
Liquefaction reports, plus mitigation measures, for new development in
susceptible areas will greatly reduce the risk of damage from liquefaction
induced building failures during an earthquake occurrence.
(Ord. MC-676, passed 9-19-1989)
§ 15.08.020 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this code is to reduce the potential risk of property damage
and loss of life due to liquefaction induced building failures during an
earthquake occurrence by requiring liquefaction reports and mitigation measures
for development in areas susceptible to liquefaction within this jurisdiction.
(Ord. MC-676, passed 9-19-1989)
§ 15.08.030 SCOPE - MAP.
   The map is included in the general plan indicating areas of liquefaction
susceptibility. All new development projects, or structural modifications over
25% of the building area, which are located within the areas of liquefaction
susceptibility as determined by the latest adopted edition of the general plan
map (“map”) may be required to provide liquefaction reports and mitigation
measures. The liquefaction susceptibility areas indicated on the map have a
historic high ground water table within 30 feet of the surface.
(Ord. MC-676, passed 9-19-1989)
§ 15.08.040 LIQUEFACTION DEFINED.
   LIQUEFACTION is defined as the transformation of a granular material from a
solid state into a liquefied state as a consequence of increased pore-water
pressures. Soils and clastic sediment with particle size in the medium sand to
silt range, as determined by the Unified Soils Classification System, are
particularly susceptible to LIQUEFACTION when they are saturated with water and
shaken by an earthquake. LIQUEFACTION at or near the surface can result in
foundation failure and property damage.
(Ord. MC-676, passed 9-19-1989)
§ 15.08.050 REPORTS REQUIRED.
   A liquefaction report, plus mitigation measures, prepared by a Registered
Civil Engineer shall be required by the Director of Development Services for
new construction or structural modification of more than 25% of the building
area for the buildings or structures listed below which fall within the high
liquefaction susceptibility areas as indicated on the map:

   (A)   The citizens of the city have become increasingly concerned with the
unsightliness, the deterioration and the degradation of certain properties,

neighborhoods and have sought the help of city government in their effort to
preserve their neighborhoods.

for property maintenance to protect the health, safety and appearance of
neighborhoods. Enforcement of these minimum maintenance requirements can reduce
and eliminate blight and deterioration of neighborhoods, protecting both

neighborhoods by the failure to maintain properties to minimum standards
results in an adverse effect on the health, safety and welfare of the citizens

designees of that Department, to post the appropriate placard at each entry
point to a building or structure upon completion of a safety assessment.

building or structure wherein no apparent structural hazard has been found.
This placard is not intended to mean that there is no damage to the building or
structure.
         (b)   RESTRICTED USE is to be posted on each building or structure
that has been damaged wherein the damage has resulted in some form of
restriction to the continued occupancy. The evaluator who posts this placard

and concisely note the restrictions on continued occupancy.
         (c)   UNSAFE: “Do Not Enter or Occupy” is to be posted on each
building or structure that has been damaged such that continued occupancy poses
a threat to life safety. Buildings or structures posted with this placard shall
not be entered under any circumstance except as authorized in writing by the
department that posted the building. Safety assessment teams shall be
authorized to enter these buildings at any time. This placard will note in
general terms the type of damage encountered.

Department, its address and phone number and a statement regarding the manner
in which an appeal may be filed.

shall not be removed, altered or covered until done so by an authorized
representative of the Department or upon written notification from the
Department.
      (4)   Any person removing such placard without the express written
consent of the City Building Official is guilty of a misdemeanor, which, upon
conviction thereof, is punishable in accordance with the provisions of §
1.12.010.
   (E)   Notification.
      (1)   The Building Official shall, as soon as practicable but no later
than 30 days from the date of posting, mail a notice to the owner of each
building posted as “Restricted Use or Unsafe.” Such notice shall be mailed to
the owner(s) of record of the property as ascertained from the latest
assessment roll of the County Assessor.

         (a)   A statement indicating that the structure has suffered disaster
related damage which constitutes a hazard to its occupants, the public or
adjacent property;

         (c)   The restrictions placed on the use or occupancy of the building;
         (d)   A brief description of the damage;
         (e)   That the damage must be repaired and the hazards eliminated
prior to re-occupancy; and
         (f)   That an appeal may be filed in accordance with the procedures
contained in this chapter.

abandonment or the failure to repair damage which poses a hazard to the
occupants, the public or adjacent property, the Building Official may initiate
abatement proceedings in accordance with
Chapters 8.30 and this chapter.

§ 15.73.010 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.
   The Mayor and City Council find and determine as follows.
   (A)   The city must provide for the acquisition, construction and
installation of certain right-of-way and related infrastructure improvements
(as hereinafter defined and as hereinafter referred to as the “right-of-way
improvements”) and certain other public improvements (as hereinafter described
and as hereinafter referred to as the “public improvements”) within the
Verdemont Area of the city in order to maintain current levels of service if
new development is to be accommodated without decreasing current levels of
service and in order to ensure that the infrastructure system is in conformity
with the requirements of the city’s general plan.
   (B)   It is in the interests of the present landowners within the Verdemont
Area and the residents, both within the Verdemont Area and within the city
generally, that the city causes the acquisition, construction and installation
of the right-of-way improvements and the public improvements within the
Verdemont Area.
   (C)   The imposition of infrastructure development fees (the “infrastructure
fees”) is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development in the
Verdemont Area bares a proportionate share of the cost of capital facilities
necessary to accommodate such development in order to effectively provide the
quality and extent of infrastructure required within the Verdemont Area.
   (D)   Development within the Verdemont Area will:
      (1)   Generate increased traffic volumes necessitating the acquisition,
construction and installation of the right of-way improvements; and
      (2)   Create a need for the acquisition, construction and installation of
the public improvements.
   (E)   Revenues generated from the levy of the infrastructure fees will be
used to facilitate the acquisition, construction and installation of the right-
of-way improvements and the public improvements which in turn will allow for
the future development of property within the Verdemont Area by providing
additional traffic flow capacity and other public improvements;
   (F)   The infrastructure fees established by §
15.73.050 shall be calculated pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the
Mayor and City Council simultaneously herewith (the “resolution”). The
infrastructure fees established by this chapter and as calculated pursuant to
the resolution are derived from, and based upon, and do not exceed the costs of
undertaking the acquisition, construction and installation of the right-of-way
improvements.
   (G)   It is anticipated that certain excess revenues may be generated
through the levy of the infrastructure fees for the acquisition, construction
and installation of the right-of-way improvements, and to the extent such
revenues are generated, such revenues as are in excess of the amount required
for the acquisition, construction and installation of the right-of-way
improvements shall be used for the purposes of funding the acquisition,
construction and installation of the public improvements, as defined in §
15.73.030; provided, however, that if such excess revenues are not generated,
then the infrastructure fees established by §
15.73.050 and calculated pursuant to the resolution will be increased in
accordance with the terms of the resolution or any subsequent resolution
adopted by the Mayor and the City Council in order to cause the funding of the
acquisition, construction and installation of the public improvements.
   (H)   That certain engineers report entitled “Engineers Report - Right-of-
Way Improvements - Verdemont Area” (the “engineers report”) sets forth the
scope and extent of the right-of-way improvements and the public improvements
required in the Verdemont Area and sets forth a reasonable methodology and
analysis for the determination of the impact of development on the need for,
and costs of, acquisition, construction and installation of the right-of-way
improvements and the public improvements in the Verdemont Area.
   (I)   This chapter shall apply only to that area of the city known as the
Verdemont Area and is intended to assist in the continued development of the
Verdemont Area.
   (J)   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the use and development of
land so as to assure that new development bears a proportionate share of the
cost of capital expenditures necessary to provide right-of-way improvements and
public improvements within or for the benefit of the Verdemont Area.
   (K)   The city has the authority to enact this chapter pursuant to the Cal.
Gov’t Code, §§ 66000 et seq. and the City Charter.
(Ord. MC-707, passed 3-19-1990)
§ 15.73.020 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed so as to

and welfare.
   (B)   For the purposes of administration and enforcement of this chapter,
unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the following rules of construction
shall apply to the text of this chapter.
      (1)   In the case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text of this chapter and any caption, illustration or summary table, the text
shall control.
      (2)   The word “shall” is always mandatory and not discretionary; the
word “may” is permissive.
      (3)   Words used in the present tense shall include the future tense; and
words used in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural the
singular unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary.
      (4)   The word “person” includes an individual, a corporation, a
partnership, an unincorporated association or any other similar entity.
      (5)   The word “includes” shall not limit the term to the specific
example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other instances or
circumstances of like kind or character.

(Ord. MC-707, passed 3-19-1990)
§ 15.73.040 PERSONS SUBJECT TO INFRASTRUCTURE FEE.
   Any person who seeks to develop land within the Verdemont Area by applying
for a building permit, an extension of a building permit, a permit for a mobile
home installation or an extension of a permit for mobile home installation to
make improvements to land which will generate additional traffic or increase
the need for public facilities is required to pay an infrastructure fee in the
manner set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. MC-707, passed 3-19-1990)
§ 15.73.050 INFRASTRUCTURE FEE.
   (A)   The infrastructure fee for any given parcel of property shall be
determined by ascertaining the land use category of the parcel and multiplying
the amount of the infrastructure fee by the number of equivalent dwelling units
allocated to such land use category. The initial amount of the infrastructure
fee shall be set by the resolution, and may be subject to increase pursuant to
the terms of any subsequent resolutions to be adopted by the Mayor and City
Council, which resolutions shall provide for increases to the infrastructure
fee in order to cover any administrative and carrying costs incurred in
connection with the issuance of bonds required in order to finance the
acquisition, construction and installation of all or any portion of the right-
of-way improvements and/or the public improvements.
   (B)   It is anticipated that there may be certain excess revenues generated
in connection with the levy of the infrastructure fee in the initial dollar
amounts and to the extent any such excess revenues do exist, said excess
revenues will be applied to fund the costs of the acquisition, construction and
installation of the public improvements. To the extent said excess revenues do
not exist, the infrastructure fee in the dollar amount, as initially
established, may be subject to additional increases by subsequent resolutions
of the Mayor and City Council in order to cause the funding of the acquisition,
construction and installation of the public improvements.
   (C)   The above-referenced subsequent resolutions and the dollar amount of
the infrastructure fee initially established pursuant to this chapter and the
resolution shall be reviewed and amended at least annually, or more often as
may be necessary under the circumstances to reflect any increases in costs.
      (1)   For applications for an extension of a building permit or an
extension of a permit for mobile home installation, the amount of the fee is
the difference between the fee then applicable and any amounts previously paid
in connection with the application for the initial permit.
      (2)   In the case of change of use, rehabilitation, expansion or
modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building
permit or permit for mobile home installation, the infrastructure fee shall be
based upon the net positive increase in the demands placed upon the right-of-
way improvements and the public improvements by the new or expanded use
compared to the previous use or level of use.
(Ord. MC-707, passed 3-19-1990)
§ 15.73.060 TIME OF PAYMENT.
   (A)   (1)   Except as may otherwise be provided in division (B) below, each
applicant for a commercial or industrial building permit shall pay to the city
the then applicable infrastructure fee, as initially established pursuant to
this chapter and adjusted pursuant to any subsequent resolutions of the city as
more fully described in §
15.73.050, upon the submission to the city of an application for a commercial
or industrial building permit, which application is complete and in a form
acceptable to the city. Each applicant for a residential building permit who
submits an application, which application is complete and in the form
acceptable to the city, shall pay to the city the then applicable
infrastructure fee, as initially established pursuant to this chapter and
adjusted pursuant to any subsequent resolutions of the city as more fully
described in §
15.73.050, for all residential units subject to a building permit upon the
earlier of the following dates:
         (a)   Upon the date of final inspection of the first dwelling unit
completed in the residential development to which the building permit is
applicable; or
         (b)   Upon the date a certificate of occupancy is issued for the first
dwelling unit completed in the residential development to which the building
permit is applicable.
      (2)   In the event the city accepts any payment of infrastructure fees in
connection with the submission of a building permit application, which
application is incomplete or not in a form satisfactory to the city, all
payments made in connection with such application shall be returned to the
applicant and such applicant shall be required to submit a complete and
acceptable application, and, at the time of such submission, shall pay any then
applicable infrastructure fees. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, the city, by official action of the Mayor and City Council, may
require the payment of applicable infrastructure fees for residential units
prior to the approval of a final tract or parcel map applicable to residential
development if one of the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The City Director of Development Services has determined that
the applicable infrastructure fee will be collected from the subdivider for
public improvements or facilities for which an account has been established and
funds have been appropriated, and for which the city has adopted a proposed
construction schedule or plan; or
         (b)   The applicable infrastructure fee will reimburse the city for
expenditures previously made by the city. All applicants for permits for the
installation of mobile homes will be subject to the procedures applicable to
residential developments set forth hereinabove.
   (B)   Any person or entity who would otherwise be required to pay the
infrastructure fee, pursuant to division (A) above, may receive as a credit
towards the infrastructure fee attributable to such person or entity, all or a
portion of the costs of any right-of-way improvements or public improvements
that may be or may have been acquired, constructed or installed by such an
entity.
   (C)   All funds collected shall be promptly identified as right-of-way/
public improvement infrastructure fees and promptly transferred for deposit in
the appropriate Right-of-Way/Public Improvement Infrastructure Fee Fund to be
held in a separate account and, together with interest earnings thereon, used
solely for the purposes specified in this chapter.
   (D)   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, for any
subdivision for which a final map has been approved prior to the effective date
of this chapter, the fee established pursuant to §
15.73.050 may be paid at the close of escrow on each individual lot, unless a
later time is allowed by this chapter.

§ 15.73.065 DEFERRAL.
   For the construction of new single-family homes, the fees imposed by §
15.73.060 may be deferred at the request of the owner of the property until the
release of utilities is issued or 18 months from the issuance of the building
permit, whichever is less. The owner of the property must personally guarantee
payment of the fees, sign documents authorizing the city to place a lien on the
property in the amount of the fees, agree to place the payment of the fees in
any escrow for the sale of the property, authorize the city to demand payment
in any such escrow and pay an administrative fee set by resolution of the Mayor
and City Council. The amount of the fees due shall be the amount in effect at
the time of collection of the fees. In no event shall utilities be released
until the fees are paid, except that electrical service may be released at the
discretion of the Building Official where necessary for security or maintenance
purposes.

to provisions of this code that otherwise would effectively preclude this
practice.
   (B)   Except as specifically stated in this chapter, nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to exempt any person or property from any otherwise
applicable provision of this code.
§ 17.06.020 DEFINITIONS.

   This chapter may be referred to as the “Mobile Source Air Pollution
Ordinance.”
(Ord. MC-784, passed 5-7-1991)
§ 17.08.020 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city finds and declares that the following apply.
      (1)   The city is committed to improving the public health, safety and
welfare, including air quality.
      (2)   Mobile sources are a major contributor to air pollution in the
South Coast Air Basin.
      (3)   Air quality goals for the region established by state law cannot be
met without reducing air pollution from mobile sources.
      (4)   The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (“AQMP”) calls upon
cities and counties to reduce emissions from motor vehicles consistent with the
requirements of the California Clean Air Act of 1988 by developing and
implementing mobile source air pollution reduction programs.
      (5)   To the extent that such programs place demands upon the city’s
funds, those programs should be financed by shifting the responsibility for
financing from the General Fund to the motor vehicles creating the demand, to
the greatest extent possible.
      (6)   Cal. Health and Safety Code, § 44223, added by action of the
California Legislature on September 30, 1990, (Stats. 1990, Ch. 1705),
authorizes the South Coast Air Quality Management District (“SCAQMD”) to impose
an additional motor vehicle registration fee of $2, commencing on April 1,
1991, increasing to $4, commencing on April 1, 1992, to finance the
implementation of transportation measures embodied in the AQMP and provisions
of the California Clean Air Act.
      (7)   Forty cents of every dollar collected under the Cal. Health and
Safety Code, § 44223 shall be distributed to cities and counties located in the
South Coast Air Quality Management District that comply with the Cal. Health
and Safety Code, § 44243, based on the jurisdiction’s prorated share of
population as defined by the State Department of Finance.
      (8)   The city is located within the South Coast Air Quality Management
District and is eligible to receive a portion of revenues from the motor
vehicle registration fees upon adoption of this chapter.
      (9)   The city, after careful consideration, finds and declares that the
imposition of the motor vehicle registration fee by the SCAQMD to finance
mobile source air pollution reduction programs is in the best interest of the
general welfare of the city and its residents.
   (B)   Therefore, the city deems it advisable to adopt this chapter.
(Ord. MC-784, passed 5-7-1991)
Statutory reference:
   California Clean Air Act of 1988, see Cal. Stats. of 1988, AB 2595

   This chapter is intended to support the SCAQMD’s imposition of the vehicle
registration fee and to bring the city into compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Cal. Health and Safety Code, § 44243 in order to receive fee
revenues for the purpose of implementing programs to reduce air pollution from
motor vehicles.
(Ord. MC-784, passed 5-7-1991)

§ 17.08.050 ADMINISTRATION OF VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE.
   (A)   Receipt of fee. Vehicle registration fees due, pursuant to this
chapter, disbursed by the SCAQMD and remitted to the city shall be accepted by
the Fee Administrator.
   (B)   Transfer of funds. Upon receipt of vehicle registration fees, the Fee
Administrator shall be responsible for placement of such funds into a separate
account as hereinafter specified.
   (C)   Establishment of Air Quality Improvement Trust Fund. The Fee
Administrator shall establish a separate interest-bearing trust fund account in
a financial institution authorized to receive deposits of city funds. Interest
earned by the account shall be credited to that account and shall be used to
finance mobile source air pollution programs.
   (D)   Audits. The city consents to audits, at least once every two years, of
all programs and projects funded by vehicle registration fee revenues provided
