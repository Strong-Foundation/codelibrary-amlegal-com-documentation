time served in probationary and permanent status and shall remain on the lists
for a period of one year unless re-employed sooner.

§ 1.61.010   Legislative findings and statement of purpose.
   (A)   The City Council hereby finds that there is a need for an alternative
method of enforcement for minor violations of the Tulare Municipal Code or
state codes specifically adopted by reference in the applicable chapters of the
Tulare Municipal Code. The City Council further finds that an appropriate
method of enforcement for minor violations is an Administrative Citation
Program, as authorized by Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.4.
   (B)   The procedures established in this chapter shall be in addition to
criminal, civil or any other legal remedy established by law, which may be
pursued to address violations of the Tulare Municipal Code and state codes
specifically adopted by reference in the applicable chapters of the Tulare
Municipal Code.
   (C)   The City Council hereby finds and determines that enforcement of the
Tulare Municipal Code, other ordinances adopted by the city, conditions on
entitlements and terms and conditions of city agreements are matters of local
concern and serve important public purposes. Consistent with its powers as a
Charter City, the City of Tulare adopts this Administrative Citation Program
provision in order to achieve the following goals, and:
      (1)   To protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
the City of Tulare;
      (2)   To gain compliance with the Tulare Municipal Code and state codes
specifically adopted by reference in the applicable chapters of the Tulare
Municipal Code in a timely and efficient manner;
      (3)   To provide a method to hold parties responsible when they fail or
refuse to comply with the provisions of the Tulare Municipal Code and state
codes specifically adopted by reference in the applicable chapters of the
Tulare Municipal Code;
      (4)   To minimize the expense and delay where the sole remedy is to
pursue responsible parties in the civil or criminal justice system; and
      (5)   To provide for an administrative process to appeal the imposition
of administrative citations and fines.
   (D)   (1)   The purpose of this chapter is to enable the city, acting as a
charter city pursuant to Article XI, §§ 5 and 7 of the state’s Constitution, to
impose and collect civil administrative fines in conjunction with the
enforcement of provisions of the Tulare Municipal Code or state codes
specifically adopted by reference in the applicable chapters of the Tulare
Municipal Code. Notwithstanding the provisions herein, the city has and shall
continue to employ the philosophy of voluntary compliance when seeking
compliance with the Tulare Municipal Code and state codes specifically adopted
by reference in the applicable chapters of the Tulare Municipal Code.
      (2)   Prior to the implementation of the enforcement policies and
penalties stated herein, voluntary compliance approaches, when practical,
should first be used in order to educate city property owners and businesses
concerning the requirements of the Tulare Municipal Code or state codes
specifically adopted by reference in the applicable chapters of the Tulare
Municipal Code, and the corrective action necessary to correct a violation of
the Tulare Municipal Code and state codes specifically adopted by reference in
the applicable chapters of the Tulare Municipal Code.
   (E)   Use of this chapter shall be at the sole discretion of the city.
(1995 Code, § 1.61.005) (Ord. 04-1953, passed - -2004)

   The City Council of the City of Tulare intends to secure compliance with the
provisions of the Tulare Municipal Code and state codes specifically adopted by
reference in the applicable chapters of the Tulare Municipal Code. To the
extent that such compliance may be achieved by less drastic methods of
enforcement the following alternate, separate and distinct methods may be
utilized. Each method set forth herein is intended to be mutually exclusive and
does not prevent concurrent or consecutive methods being used to achieve
compliance against continuing violations. Each and every day any such
violations exist constitutes a separate offense. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Tulare Municipal Code and state codes specifically adopted by
reference in the applicable chapters of the Tulare Municipal Code, each
violation of the provisions of this code may be enforced alternatively as
follows:
   (A)   Infraction. Violations of any provision or failing to comply with any
mandatory requirement is punishable as an infraction unless the applicable
chapter specifically states otherwise. Written citations for infractions may be
issued by police officers or non-safety employees designated by Tulare

ordinance within 12 months; and
      (3)   A fine not exceeding $500 for each additional violation of the same
ordinance within 12 months.
   (B)   Misdemeanor. A violation is punishable as a misdemeanor if the
applicable chapter so states, but the City Attorney may prosecute as an
infraction with concurrence of the court. Written citations for misdemeanors
may be issued by police officers or by non-safety employees designated by
Tulare Municipal Code Chapters
1.60,
3.04,
3.24 and
6.16. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of the Tulare
Municipal Code and state codes specifically adopted by reference in the
applicable chapters of the Tulare Municipal Code, shall be punished by a fine
not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or by
both such fine and imprisonment.
   (C)   Civil action. The City Attorney, or an attorney hired for such
purposes by and at the request of the City Council, may institute an action in
any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain, enjoin or abate the condition
(s) found to be in violation of the provisions of the Tulare Municipal Code or
state codes specifically adopted by reference in the applicable chapters of the
Tulare Municipal Code, as provided by law.
   (D)   Administrative citation. Upon a finding by the city official vested
with the authority to enforce the various provisions of the Tulare Municipal
Code or state codes specifically adopted by reference in the applicable
chapters of the Tulare Municipal Code, that a violation exists, he or she may
issue an administrative citation under the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Administrative fine schedule. All administrative fines referenced
throughout the Tulare Municipal Code shall be as set forth in the
Administrative Fine Schedule as established and adopted by resolution of the
City Council of the City of Tulare. If any ordinance establishes an
administrative fee amount which is in conflict with the Administrative Fine
Schedule the amount as defined in the schedule will be deemed the correct
amount.

to locate the responsible person, the administrative citation shall be mailed
to the responsible person by certified mail, postage prepaid with a requested

sent by first class mail is not returned.
      (3)   Service by citation by posting notice. If the Enforcement Officer
does not succeed in serving the responsible person personally, or of certified
mail or regular mail, the Enforcement Officer shall post the administrative

§ 1.64.010   Findings and intent.
   (A)   Pursuant to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, it is the
intent of the City Council to require the ascertainment and recovery of costs
reasonably borne from fees, charges and regulatory license fees levied therefor
in providing the regulation, products or services hereinafter enumerated in
this chapter.
   (B)   The fee and service charge revenue/cost comparison system set for in
this chapter provides a mechanism for ensuring that fees adopted by the city
for services rendered do not exceed the reasonable estimated cost for providing
the services for which the fees are charged.
   (C)   The adoption of the chapter is exempt from the California Environment
Quality Act (Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 2100 et seq.), because it approves
and sets forth a procedure for determining fees for the purpose of meeting the
operating expenses of city departments, as set forth in Cal. Public Resources
Code § 21080(b)(8)(1).
(1995 Code, § 1.64.010)
§ 1.64.020 Delegation of authority and direction to Manager.
   (A)   The City Manager is hereby delegated the authority and directed to
provide documents to the City Council to implement its herein enumerated policy
to adjust fees and charges to recover the percentage of costs reasonably borne
as established hereby, in providing the regulation, product or service
enumerated in this chapter in the percentage of cost reasonably borne and on
the schedule of rate review and revision, as hereinafter established in this
chapter.
   (B)   The City Manager is hereby delegated the authority to issue executive
orders defining terms, setting out administrative, fee collection and financial
procedures, definitions and establishing effective dates of all fees set by the
City Council by resolution. All executive orders shall be originated and signed
by the affected department head, shall be signed by the Finance Director
certifying that the financial requirements of this chapter are complied with
and shall be signed by the City Manager connoting the effective date of the
executive order and new or revised rate structure, procedure or definition.
   (C)   “Costs reasonably borne” shall be as defined in §
1.64.030. In adjusting fees and charges, the City Manager shall act in an
administrative and ministerial capacity and shall consider only the standards
and criteria established by this chapter and the procedures set hereby and by
applicable state law. All executive orders issued hereunder shall comply in all
respects with this chapter, and the several schedules of fees and rates as set
by the City Council by resolution.
(1995 Code, § 1.64.020)
§ 1.64.030   “Costs reasonably borne” defined.
   COSTS REASONABLY BORNE, as used and ordered to be applied in this chapter,
are to consist of the following elements:
   (A)   All applicable direct costs including, but not limited to salaries,
wages, overtime, employee fringe benefits, services and supplies, maintenance
and operation expenses, contracted services, special supplies and any other
direct expense incurred;
   (B)   All applicable indirect costs including, but not restricted to,
building maintenance and operations, equipment maintenance and operations,
communications expenses, computer costs, printing and reproduction, vehicle
expenses, insurance, debt service and like expenses when distributed on an
accounted and documented rational proration system;
   (C)   Fixed asset recovery expenses, consisting of depreciation of fixes
assets, and additional fixed asset expense recovery charges calculated on the
current estimated cost of replacement, divided by the approximate life
expectancy of the fixed asset. A further additional charge to make up the
difference between book value depreciation not previously recovered and
reserved in cash and the full cost of replacement, also shall be calculated and
considered a copy so as to recover the unrecovered costs between book value and
cost of replacement over the remaining life of the asset;
   (D)   General overhead, expressed as a percentage, distributing and charging
the expenses of the City Council, City Attorney, City Administration, City
Clerk, Finance Director/Treasurer, Economic Development, Finance Department,
Personnel Office and City Promotion and all other staff and support service
provided to the entire city organization. Overhead shall be prorated between
tax-financed services and fee-financed services on the basis of the percentage
so that each of taxes and fees and charges shall proportionately defray the
overhead costs;
   (E)   Departmental overhead, expressed as a percentage, distributing and
charging the cost of each department head and his or her supporting expenses as
enumerated in divisions (A), (B), (C) and (F) of this section; and
   (F)   Debt service cost, consisting of repayment of principal, payment of
interest and trustee fees and administrative expenses for all applicable bond,
certificate, note or securities issues or loans of whatever nature or kind. Any
required coverage factors or required or established reserves beyond basic debt
service costs also shall be considered a cost if required by covenant within
the securities ordinance, resolution, indenture or general all applicable to
the city.
(1995 Code, § 1.64.030)
§ 1.64.040   Schedule of fees and service charges.
   (A)   All fees and service charges are listed on the master fee schedule.
   (B)   The City Manager, Finance Director and each city department head,
under the direction of the City Manager, shall review annually the fees and
service charges listed on the master fee schedule, and provide an adjusted
master fee schedule, by resolution, to the City Council for its consideration
so as to recover the listed percentage of cost reasonably borne necessary to
provide the listed regulation, product or service. In the alternative, the
Council may elect, by resolution, to automatically adjust fees by percentage
equal to the Consumer Price Index as published by the Department of Labor for
the preceding 12 months. Any such automatic adjustments shall not apply to fees
which are based on variable factors which themselves result in an automatic
adjustment or those which are specifically indicated otherwise.
   (C)   (1)   For all fees and charges for services and programs provided by
the Recreation Parks Divisions of the City of Tulare, the City Council does
hereby designate the Parks and Community Services Commission as the body which
shall establish a list of all such fees and charges. The Recreation, Parks and
Library Director shall review the fees and charges as frequently as deemed
necessary and provide an adjusted fee or charge schedule to the Parks and
Community Services Commission for its consideration and adoption, so as to
recover the established percentage of cost reasonably borne necessary to
provide the listed service or program. With regard to Parks and Recreation fees
and charges, whenever in this chapter there is a reference to the City Council,
it shall mean the Parks and Community Services Commission; and whenever there
is a reference to the City Manager it shall mean the Recreation, Parks and
Library Director.
      (2)   For all fees and charges for services and programs provided by the
Library Department of the City of Tulare, the City Council does hereby
designate the Library Board as the body which shall establish a list of all
such fees and charges. The Library Director shall review the fees and charges
as frequently as deemed necessary and provide an adjusted fee or charge
schedule to the Library Board for its consideration and adoption, so as to
recover the established percentage of cost reasonably borne necessary to
provide the listed service or program. With regard to Library fees and charges,
whenever in this chapter there is a reference to the City Council, it shall
mean the Library Board; and whenever there is a reverence to the City Manager
it shall mean the Library Director.
   (D)   All fees and charges set pursuant to this chapter and section shall
take effect 60 days after the City Council adopts a resolution establishing the
fee amount.
   (E)   The schedule of frequency of rate adjustments may be varied by the
City Manager to adjust revenues sufficient to meet debt service coverage
requirements of any bond, certificate or ordinance, resolution, indenture,
contract or action under which securities have been issued by the city which
contain any coverage factor requirement.
   (F)   The City Manager may vary the annually scheduled review if, in the
judgment of the City Manager and a directly affected and requesting department
head, gross inequity would be perpetrated by not revising the rate schedule.
Any such rate revision which deviates from the annually scheduled review shall
be reported to the City Council at its next succeeding meeting.
   (G)   The City Manager is further delegated the authority to round off,
either upward or downward as he or she deems appropriate, to the nearest
dollar, five or ten dollars, as may be appropriate in light of the magnitude of
the fee, the actual fee or service charge to be imposed, after applying the
appropriate percentage rate, for the sale of ease of administration, accounting
and financial operations.

§ 2.12.010   Purposes and objectives.
   It is hereby declared that, in order to promote the best interest of the
city and its citizens, there is a need to establish and create a board
consisting of community residents, to review citizen complaints filed against
Police Department personnel and the investigation thereof by the Police
Department. The Board shall be charged with the responsibility to review the
Police Department’s investigation of the citizen complaints and provide its
independent review to the Chief of Police. The Board is not intended to, nor
shall it be invested with authority to, review disciplinary action if any,
proposed and/or imposed upon police personnel as a result of the investigation
of the citizen complaints. The creation of this Board for these purposes is
intended to ensure continued and ongoing public confidence in Police Department
personnel and Police Department operations.
(1995 Code, § 2.12.010)
§ 2.12.020   Scope of authority of the Board.
   The Board shall have the authority to receive citizen complaints of alleged
police officer misconduct in the form of misuse of force, false arrest,
discrimination, criminal conduct, use of racial or ethnic slurs, abuse of
authority, extreme discourtesy and/or serious misconduct. The Board shall also
have the authority to review the Police Department investigation of all such
allegations of police officer misconduct. The Board shall further have the
authority to make an annual report summarizing its activities and providing
statistical information regarding the receipt and processing of citizen
complaints of police officer misconduct.
(1995 Code, § 2.12.020)
§ 2.12.030   Filing of citizen complaints.
   Citizen complaints of alleged police officer misconduct in the form of
misuse of force, false arrest, discrimination, criminal conduct, use of racial
or ethnic slurs, abuse of authority, extreme discourtesy and/or serious
misconduct may be submitted, in either oral or written form, to either the
Police Department, the City Clerk or the Board. However, to be subject to
review under this chapter all such citizen complaints are required to be
completed in writing, on the Police Department approved form, and must contain
the signature of the complainant. The formal written complaints shall be filed
in person or by mail, within 60 days of the occurrence of the alleged
misconduct. Copies of all such formal complaints shall be provided to the
complainant, the Police Chief and the Chairperson of the Review Board. Citizen
complaints of alleged police officer misconduct of a nature other than as set
forth hereinabove shall be referred directly to the Police Department for
review and appropriate action and shall not be subject to review by the Board.
The entire Board shall review all citizen complaints and determine, by majority
approval, which of the complaints are within the authority of the Board to
review. Written notice of this determination shall be provided by the Board to
the complainant and the Police Department.
(1995 Code, § 2.12.030)
§ 2.12.040   Investigation of complaints.
   All citizen complaints of alleged police officer misconduct subject to this

Department for review and investigation. The Investigations Captain or other
person designated by the Police Chief shall review the citizen complaint and
conduct an investigation as appropriate and consistent with the Department’s
citizen’s complaint policy in effect at the time of the filing of the citizen
complaint. The investigation by the Police Department shall be completed within
30 days of receipt by the Department of the formal written complaint. Under
special circumstances and with the approval of the Chief of Police, the
investigation may take longer than 30 days to complete. In such circumstances,
the Chief shall provide written notice to the Board that it is necessary to
allow for a longer period of time to complete the subject investigation.
(1995 Code, § 2.12.040)
§ 2.12.050   Report to Board.
   Upon completion of the investigation, the Investigations Captain shall
prepare and deliver to the Board a written report, along with a copy of all
documentation gathered in the course of the investigation. The report shall be
the same document as the Investigations Captain would deliver to the Police
Chief upon completion of his or her investigation under the Department’s
citizen’s complaint policy. The report shall be submitted to the Board before
it is submitted to the Chief. The report shall include the findings and
conclusions of the Investigations Captain and any recommendations relating to
adjudication of the citizen’s complaint.
(1995 Code, § 2.12.050)
§ 2.12.060   Preliminary review by Board.
   Upon receipt of the copy of the Investigation Captain’s report, the
Chairperson of the Board shall place the matter on the agenda for the next
regular meeting of the Board, or shall schedule a special meeting of the Board
to consider the matter, as he or she deems appropriate to ensure timely
processing, for a preliminary review by the Board. The report shall be
presented to and reviewed by the Board at that time. At the conclusion of the
preliminary review, the Chairperson shall poll the Board and proceed as
follows:
   (A)   If three or more of the voting members of the Board agree that more
information is necessary, the Chairperson shall note this in writing and return
the matter to the Investigations Captain for further investigation and
submission of a supplemental report;
   (B)   If the Board determines that the information provided is sufficient to
proceed, it shall take one of the following actions:
      (1)   If a majority of the voting members of the Board believe that there
is no need for a more in-depth review of the matter, they shall adopt findings
by a majority vote and direct the Chairperson to prepare a report and submit it
to the Chief of Police. The report shall specify whether the Board supports or
disagrees with the findings of the Investigations Captain. In the event the
Board disagrees, the report shall further set forth specific reasons and
analysis therefor.
      (2)   If a majority of the voting members of the Board believe that an
in-depth review of the matter is necessary and appropriate, the Chairperson
shall schedule such a review at a meeting of the Board to be held within two
weeks, or as soon thereafter as is possible. Thereafter, at the subsequent
meeting of the Board, an in-depth review of the matter shall be conducted
pursuant to the provisions of §
2.12.070 hereinbelow.
(1995 Code, § 2.12.060)
§ 2.12.070   In-depth review by Board.
   When, pursuant to §
2.12.060(B)(2) hereinabove, an in-depth review of a citizen complaint
investigation is scheduled by the Board, notice of the date, time and place of
the meeting shall be provided by the Board, in writing, to the Investigations
Captain, the complainant and to the officer or officers involved. At the time
and place of the meeting, the Board shall meet with the Investigations Captain
to discuss the matter. The complainant, the officer or officers involved and
other interested parties shall be provided with the opportunity to appear
before the Board and make written and/or oral statements.
(1995 Code, § 2.12.070)
§ 2.12.080   Conduct of in-depth review.
   All such in-depth reviews shall be conducted in an informal manner. It shall
not be necessary to have any party wishing to make a statement swear an oath,
nor shall any party be provided with the opportunity to ask questions or
otherwise cross-examine any other party providing a statement to the Board.
Board members shall have the opportunity to ask questions from any person
appearing and making a statement. The in-depth reviews shall be closed to the
public and no one shall be permitted to be present during the process except

default by the permittee, the surety shall have the same option.
(1995 Code, § 4.32.110)
§ 4.32.120   Release of security.
   Any surety bond or instrument of credit posted as security pursuant to this
chapter shall remain in effect until the Building Official gives written notice
to the interested parties that all of the terms and conditions of the
relocation permit have been complied with. If security in the form of cash or
negotiable bonds has been deposited, the Building Official shall return such
security to the depositor or to his or her successors or assigns when all of
the terms and conditions of the relocation permit have been complied with,
except any portion of the security that has been used or deducted pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter.
(1995 Code, § 4.32.120)
§ 4.32.130   Access to premises.
   The Building Official, the surety and the duly authorized representatives of
either, shall have access to the premises described in the relocation permit

default in the performance of any term or condition of the relocation permit,
the surety or any person employed or engaged in behalf of the surety, or the
Building Official or any person employed or engaged on his or her behalf, may
go upon the premises to complete the required work or to remove or demolish the
building or structure. It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere with or
obstruct the ingress or egress to or from any such premises of any authorized
representative or agent of any surety of the City of Tulare who is engaged in
the work of completing, demolishing or removing any building or structure for
which a relocation permit has been issued, after a default has occurred in the

(1995 Code, § 4.32.130)

   The applicant for a relocation permit shall pay to the Building Official a
fee established from time to time by resolution of the City Council for the
inspection of each building located within the city that is to be relocated. If
the building or buildings to be relocated are situated outside of the city at
the time of the inspection, the applicant shall pay to the Building Official a
fee for the inspection of one building, and an additional fee for each
additional building owned by the applicant which is inspected on the same day
that the first building is inspected.
(1995 Code, § 4.32.140)

Enforcement Official for an administrative hearing within the time limit set

§ 4.96.030 Small residential rooftop solar energy system review process.
   (A)   Cal. Gov't Code § 65850.5 provides that, on or before September 30,
2015, every city, county, or city and county shall adopt an ordinance that
creates an expedited, streamlined permitting process for small residential
rooftop solar energy systems.
   (B)   Cal. Gov't Code § 65850.5 provides that in developing an expedited
permitting process, the city, county, or city and county shall adopt a
checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop solar energy systems
shall comply to be eligible for expedited review.
   (C)   The checklist shall be published on the city's internet website. The
applicant may submit the permit application and associated documentation to the
city's building division by personal, mailed, or electronic submittal together
with any required permit processing and inspection fees. In the case of
electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms,
applications and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature.
   (D)   Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall:
      (1)   Verify to the applicant's reasonable satisfaction through the use
of standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for
the small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to
transfer all wind, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system
to the building foundation; and
      (2)   At the applicant's cost, verify to the applicant's reasonable
satisfaction using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing
electrical system including existing line, load, ground and bonding wiring as
well as main panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the
existing electrical system's current use, to carry all new photovoltaic
electrical loads.
   (E)   For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for
expedited review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in
a timely manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the Building
Official and Fire Chief. If a small residential rooftop solar energy system
fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is authorized; however the subsequent
inspection need not conform to the requirements of this subsection.
   (F)   An application that satisfies the information requirements in the
checklist, as determined by the Building Official, shall be deemed complete.
Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the Building Official shall issue a
written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any
additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance.
   (G)   Upon confirmation by the Building Official of the application and
supporting documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the
checklist, the Building Official shall administratively approve the application
and issue all required permits or authorizations. Such approval does not
authorize an applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system
to the local utility provider's electricity grid. The applicant is responsible
for obtaining such approval or permission from the local utility provider.

§ 5.68.010   Title.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Transient Occupancy Tax Law of the City
of Tulare”.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.010)
§ 5.68.020   Definitions.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the following definitions shall
govern the construction of this chapter.
   HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping proposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel,
studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house,
dormitory, public or private club, or other similar structure or portion
thereof. HOTEL also includes a “mobile home”, as defined in Cal. Health and
Safety Code § 18008, which is located outside a mobile home park when the
tenant is not an employee of the owner or operator of the mobile home. HOTEL
does not include a hospital room, medical clinic, convalescent home or home for
the aged. Also, HOTEL does not include a private home, vacation cabin or
similar facility which is rented by a person who is not regularly engaged in
the business of renting the facilities and does so only occasionally and
incidentally to his or her own use thereof.
   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of
any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes.
   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, subleasee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. If the operator performs his or her functions through a
managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing
agent shall also be deemed an OPERATOR for the purposes of this chapter and
shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance
with provisions of this chapter be either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   RENT. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom.
   TAX COLLECTOR. The Tax Collector of the City of Tulare.
   TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a
period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar
days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be
deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there
is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for
a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date of this chapter may be considered.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.020)
§ 5.68.030   Amount of tax—Prepayment by transient.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel on and after July 1, 1994, each
transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent
charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to
the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city.
The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the
rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the
tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due when the
transient ceases to occupy space in the hotel. If the tax due is not paid to
the operator, the tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Collector.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.030)
§ 5.68.040   Exemptions.
   No tax shall be imposed upon the following persons:
   (A)   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the
power of the city to impose tax herein provided;
   (B)   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty; and
   (C)   Any occupant whose rent is less than $2 a day. No exemption shall be
granted under divisions (A), (B) or (C) of this section unless a claim of
exemption in the form prescribed by the Tax Collector is executed by the
transient under penalty of perjury and filed with the operator at the time rent
is collected.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.060)
§ 5.68.050   Duties of operator.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged
and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment of the tax from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part therefor will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.050)
§ 5.68.060   Registration of operators.
   Every person engaging or about to engage in business as an operator of a
hotel in the city shall register with the Tax Collector on a form provided by
him or her. Persons engaged in such business must so register not later than
January 1, 1965, or within 30 days after commencing business whichever is
later, but the privilege of registration after the date of imposition of the
tax shall not relieve any person from the obligation of collection and payment
of tax on and after the date of imposition thereof, regardless of registration.
The registration form shall set forth the name under which the person transact
or intends to transact business, the location of his or her place or places of
business and such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as
the Tax Collector may require. The registration form shall be signed by the
owner if a natural person, by a member or partner in case of an association or
partnership, and by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized
by the corporation to sign the registration form in the case of a corporation.
The Tax Collector shall, within ten days after receiving the registration form,
issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect
the tax from transients, together with a duplicate thereof for each additional
place of business of the registrant. The certificates shall be nonassignable
and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the Tax Collector
upon the cessation of business at the location named or upon sale or transfer
of the hotel. Each certificate shall be prominently displayed in the hotel so
as to be seen and come to the notice readily of all occupants and persons
seeking occupancy. The certificate shall contain the following information:
   (A)   The name of the operator;
   (B)   The address of the hotel;
   (C)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (D)   The following statement: “This Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled
the requirements of the Transient Occupancy Tax Law of the City by registering
with the Tax Collector for the purpose of collecting from transients the
Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Collector. This
certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or
to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel
without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not
limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or
office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.”
   (E)   Such additional information as may be required by the Tax Collector.

§ 5.68.070   Reporting and remitting.

reporting period which may be established by the Tax Collector, make a return
to the Tax Collector, on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected from transient
occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the Tax Collector. The Tax Collector may
establish shorter reporting periods for any operator if he or she deems it
necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require
additional information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately
upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators
pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city
until payment thereof is made to the Tax Collector.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.070)
§ 5.68.080   Remittance by mail.
   If a remittance to cover a payment required by this chapter to be made to
the Tax Collector on or before a specified date is sent through the United
States mail, properly addressed with postage prepaid, it shall be deemed to
have been received by the Tax Collector on the date shown by the post office
cancellation mark stamped upon the envelope containing the remittance, or on
the date it was mailed if proof satisfactory to the Tax Collector establishes
that the mailing occurred on an earlier date. Nothing in this section shall be
construed as constituting payment of any remittance required, unless the
remittance is actually received by the Tax Collector.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.080)
§ 5.68.090   Penalties and interest—Original delinquency.
   Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the
time required by §
5.68.070 of this chapter shall pay a penalty of 10% of the amount of the tax in
addition to the amount of the tax.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.090)

last day of the second calendar month following the close of each calendar
quarter shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 10% of the amount of the tax
in addition to the amount of the tax and the 10% penalty first imposed.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.100)
§ 5.68.110   Fraud.
   If the Tax Collector determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due
under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25% of the amount of the tax
shall be added thereto in additional to the penalties stated in §§
5.68.090 and
5.68.100 of this chapter.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.110)
§ 5.68.120   Interest.
   In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any
tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or
any fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the
date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.120)
§ 5.68.130   Penalties and interest merge with tax.
   Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of
§§
5.68.090 through
5.68.120 of this chapter shall become a part of the tax herein required to be
paid.
(1995 Code, § 5.68.130)
§ 5.68.140   Failure to collect and report tax.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within
the time provide in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Collector shall proceed in
such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which
to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Collector
secures such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to
base the assessment of any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make the report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to
determine and assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties
provided for by this chapter. When the determination has been made, the Tax
Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at this last known address. The operator
may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of the notice, make
application in writing to the Tax Collector for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
ten-day period, the tax, interest and penalties determined by the Tax Collector
shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the Tax Collector shall give not less than five-days’
written notice to the operator, in the manner prescribed above, to show cause
at a time and place fixed in said notice why the amount specified therein
should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the Tax Collector shall determine
the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
operator in the manner prescribed above of the determination and the amount of
the tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be
payable 15 days after the serving or mailing of the notice unless an appeal is
taken as provided in §

or she may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis
of the facts contained in the return or upon the basis of any information
within his or her possession or that may come into his or her possession. One
or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for any period.
The Tax Collector shall give to the operator written notice of his or her
determination in the same manner as provided in §

on the amount assessed to him or her pursuant to the procedure set forth in §

§ 5.74.030   Constitutional, statutory, and other exemptions.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon any
person or service when the imposition of such tax upon such person or service
would be in violation of a federal or state statute, the Constitution of the
United States or the constitution of the state.
   (B)   (1)   Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this
chapter pursuant to division (A) of this section shall file an application with
the Tax Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement
shall not apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or
subdivision with a commonly recognized name for such service. The application
shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state
those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for
an exemption, and shall include the names of all utility service suppliers
serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the Tax Administrator, such
service user shall give the Tax Administrator timely written notice of any
change in utility service suppliers so that the Tax Administrator can properly
notify the new utility service supplier of the service user’s tax exempt
status. A service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be
entitled to a refund of utility users’ taxes collected and remitted to the Tax
Administrator from such service user as a result of such noncompliance.

5.74.160 of this chapter. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and

service shall be exempt, in whole or in part from such tax for a specified
period of time.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator shall prepare a list of the persons exempt from
the provisions of this chapter by virtue of this section and furnish a copy

communication services. The maximum tax imposed by this section shall be at the
rate of six percent of the charges made for such services and shall be
collected from the service user by the communication services supplier or its
billing agent. There is a rebuttable presumption that communication services,
which are billed to a billing or service address in the city, are used, in
whole or in part, within the city’s boundaries, and such services are subject
to taxation under this chapter. If the billing address of the service user is
different from the service address, the service address of the service user
shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax. As used in this section, the
term CHARGES shall include the value of any other services, credits, property
of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in

chapter, sourcing rules for the taxation of other communication services,

communication services, and private communication services, provided that such
rules are based upon custom and common practice that further administrative
efficiency and minimize multi-jurisdictional taxation.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to communication
service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this
chapter, an administrative ruling identifying those communication services, or
charges therefore, that are subject to or not subject to the tax of division
(A) above.
   (D)   As used in this section, the term TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES shall
include, but are not limited to charges for: connection, reconnection,
termination, movement, or change of telecommunication services; late payment
fees; detailed billing; central office and custom calling features (including
but not limited to call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and

limited to, charges for the following:

      (7)   Equipment leases (e.g., converters, remote devices); and
      (8)   Service calls, service protection plans, name changes, changes of
services, and special services.
   (F)   To facilitate the uniform interpretation and application of similar
ordinance provisions in other local jurisdictions in the state, the Tax
Administrator may, prior to issuing and disseminating a sourcing rule or an
administrative tax ruling, submit its proposed sourcing rule or administrative
tax ruling to a municipal organization for review and comment, according to the
rules and procedures of that municipal organization, or its successor
organization.
   (G)   To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of communication
services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the
Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in
another state or city on such communication services, shall be allowed a credit
against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed
in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not
exceed the tax owed to the city under this section.  
   (H)   The tax on communication services imposed by this section shall be
collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax
collected in one month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the
following month.
   (I)   Upon a showing of hardship, the Tax Administrator may administratively
delay the implementation of this section until no later than January 1, 2008.
Prior to such time, the Tax Administrator may administratively permit the
telecommunications tax to be applied to telecommunication services in the same
manner as the federal excise tax was applied to communication services as
defined in §§ 4251 and 4252 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the IRS
regulations and rulings pertaining thereto, prior to May 25, 2006, and
regardless of whether charges for such services are based on time, distance, or
on any other basis, and as such sections are limited by the exceptions of §§
4252(d) and 4253.
   (J)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A) hereinabove, the City
Council may, by Resolution, to be adopted on or before May 15 of each year,
reduce the tax rate of division (A) and/or adopt a maximum tax for certain
classes of customers, for the ensuing fiscal year as set forth in said
Resolution. Unless the City Council re-adopts said Resolution by May 15 of the
subsequent year, the tax percentage reduction and any other actions taken (e.g.
establishment of a maximum tax) shall automatically expire and be discontinued,
and the original voter-approved tax percentage shall apply, without the
necessity of a vote of the people.

§ 5.74.050   Bundling taxable items with non-taxable items.
   Except as otherwise provided by applicable federal or state law, if any
nontaxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable
service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the
combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies, by
reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge that
are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier’s books and records
kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax
purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper
apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
§ 5.74.060   Substantial nexus/minimum contacts.
   (A)   For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and
remit a tax under this chapter, substantial nexus and minimum contacts shall be
construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of
the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law,
and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by
statutory enactment. Any communication service (including VoIP) used by a
person with a service address in the city, which service is capable of
terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be
subject to a rebuttable presumption that substantial nexus/minimum contacts
exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and
remit a tax, under this chapter. A service supplier shall be deemed to have
sufficient activity in the city for tax collection and remittance purposes if
its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains
or has within the city, directly or through an agent or subsidiary, a place of
business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees, independent

distributed in the city by means other than the United States mail.
   (B)   The city shall make available, upon request, an accurate description

information provided by city, it shall not be responsible for any errors in
taxation that may result.

made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.

   (A)   Taxes collected from a service user are delinquent if not received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a

on the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A
direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods
of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a
service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this division shall
be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date,
and the transfer settles into the city’s account on the following business day.
   (B)   If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users’ tax
fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more
services or charges on the customer’s billing) or fails to remit the tax
collected on or before the due date, the Tax Administrator shall attach a
penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of 15% of the total
tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay interest
at the rate of and 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of
the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent, until paid.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional
penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or
remitting at the rate of 15% of the amount of the tax collected and/or required
to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.
   (D)   For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest
that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the
tax herein required to be paid.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator may, in his or
her discretion, modify the due dates of this chapter to be consistent with any
uniform standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by other public
agencies imposing a utility users tax, or otherwise legally established, to
create a central payment location or mechanism.

§ 5.74.100   Actions to collect.
   Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such
tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax
Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to
collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person
owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to
an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount,
including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with
any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person’s
noncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed
by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 U.S.C
§ 507(a)(8)(C).
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
§ 5.74.110   Deficiency determination and assessment – Tax application errors.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or
she determines that any person required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper
amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable
services or charges.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency
determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice
shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate
of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the
date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within 14 calendar
days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in
writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter.
   (C)   If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time
period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final
assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the city. If the person
requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for
hearing, which shall be scheduled within 30 days after receipt of the written
request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person at least ten calendar days prior
to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires the person to produce
specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records
requested to be produced.
   (D)   At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear
all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested
parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be
continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of
additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the
hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-
assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original
deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to
person owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed
pursuant to §
5.74.160 of this chapter. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and
appeal to the City Manager pursuant to §
5.74.160 of this chapter is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
   (E)   Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth day following the
date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency
shall be 15% on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the
rate of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The
applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the city seeking payment
of a tax assessed under this chapter shall commence from the date of
delinquency as provided in this division (E).
   (F)   All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage
prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the
date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
§ 5.74.120   Administrative remedy – Non-paying service users.
   (A)   Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has
deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the
amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax
Administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve
such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from
certain named service users for specific billing periods. To the extent the
service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two or
more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation
to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the city with the
names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under
the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency
penalty at the rate of 15% of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay
interest at the rate of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator shall notify the non-paying service user that
the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due
for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties
and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal
delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made
by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a
change of address, to his or her last known address.
   (D)   If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator
within 30 days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the
Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of 15% of the amount of the
total tax that is owed.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
§ 5.74.130   Additional powers and duties of the Tax Administrator.
   (A) The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby
directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations
consistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting,
clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance
of the taxes herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a new
tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this section, or increase
an existing tax, except as allowed by Cal. Government Code § 53750(h)(2). A
copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax
Administrator’s office.
   (C)   Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make
administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict
requirements of this chapter and thereby:
      (1)   Conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier
so long as the agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance
with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or
      (2)   To avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection
and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement
shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office, and are voidable by the Tax
Administrator or the city at any time.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to
collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax Administrator
shall notify the person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the
absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review
shall not exceed a period of three years next preceding the date of receipt of
the written notice by the person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of
the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant
to §
5.74.110 of this chapter for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest)
owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the
Tax Administrator. If the person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient
records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter,
the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the
deficiency. The reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable
presumption of correctness.
   (E)   Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause,
the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required
pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed 45 days, provided that
the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the
request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason
of such extension. Interest shall accrue during the extension at the rate of
0.75% per month, prorated for any portion thereof.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person
who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this
chapter.
   (G)   Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the Tax
Administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required
to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this chapter
if the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-
collection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into
consideration industry practice or other precedence.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
§ 5.74.140   Records.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit
to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period
of at least three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the
amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and
remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator shall
have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.
   (B)   The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to
deliver, to the Tax Administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by
the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the
delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if
such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary
course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to
the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative
subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the city on or
before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the city for all
reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect those records,
including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the
normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to
conduct the inspection.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure
agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the confidentiality of
customer information pursuant to Cal. Revenue and Tax Code §§ 7284.6 and
7284.7.
   (D)   If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to
bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall:
      (1)   Provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone
number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the
service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and
      (2)   Upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the
delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent
or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is
necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or
remittance of such tax to the city.
   (E)   If any person subject to record-keeping under this section
unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator access to such records, or fails to
produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time
specified, then the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of $500 on such
person for each day following:
      (1)   The initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or
      (2)   The due date for production of records as set forth in the
administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty
imposed under this chapter.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
5.74.150   Refunds.
   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or
has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax
Administrator under this chapter from a person or service supplier, it may be
refunded as provided in this section.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid or
paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received
by the Tax Administrator under this chapter from a person or service supplier,
provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section
unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor, or
administrator has submitted a written claim to the Tax Administrator within one
year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of the tax. Such
claim must clearly establish claimant’s right to the refund by written records
showing entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim
on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers unless each member of the class has
submitted a written claim under penalty of perjury as provided by this section.
   (B)   The filing of a written claim pursuant to Cal. Government Code § 935
is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action brought against the city
pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Cal. Government
Code §§ 945.6 and 946. The Tax Administrator, or the City Council where the
claim is in excess of $5,000, shall act upon the refund claim within the time
period set forth in Cal. Government Code § 912.4. If the Tax Administrator or
City Council fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the time
prescribed by Cal. Government § 912.4, the claim shall be deemed to have been
rejected by the City Council on the last day of the period within which the
City Council was required to act upon the claim as provided in Cal. Government
Code § 912.4. The Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form
which substantially complies with that set forth in Cal. Government Code § 913.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the notice provisions of division (A) of this section,
a service supplier that has collected any amount of tax in excess of the amount
of tax imposed by this chapter and actually due from a service user (whether
due to overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of the tax), may refund
such amount to the service user, or credit to charges subsequently payable by
the service user to the service supplier, and claim credit for such overpayment
against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns to the
Tax Administrator, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later
than one year from the date of overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection
of the tax. The Tax Administrator shall first determine the validity of the
service user’s claim of credit, and the underlying basis for such claim.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the notice provisions of division (A) of this section,
in the event that a service supplier remits a tax to city in excess of the
amount of tax imposed by this chapter, the service supplier may claim credit
for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other
monthly returns to the Tax Administrator, provided such credit is claimed in a
return dated no later than one year from the date of overpayment of the tax.
The Tax Administrator shall first determine the validity of the service user’s
claim of credit, and the underlying basis for such claim.

§ 5.74.160   Appeals.
   (A)   The provisions of this section apply to any decision (other than a
decision relating to a refund pursuant to §
5.74.150 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or
administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator. Any person aggrieved by any
decision (other than a decision relating to a refund pursuant to §
5.74.150 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or
administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator, shall be required to comply
with the appeals procedure of this section. Compliance with this section shall
be a prerequisite to a suit thereon. (See Cal. Government Code § 935(b).)
Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim or action on behalf of a
class or group of taxpayers.
   (B)   If any person is aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision
relating to a refund pursuant to §
5.74.150 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or
administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator, he or she may appeal to the
City Manager by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 14 days of
the date of the decision, deficiency determination, assessment, or
administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator which aggrieved the service user
or service supplier.
   (C)   The matter shall be scheduled for hearing before an independent
hearing officer selected by the City Manager, no more than 30 days from the
receipt of the appeal. The appellant shall be served with notice of the time
and place of the hearing, as well as any relevant materials, at least five
calendar days prior to the hearing. The hearing may be continued from time to
time upon mutual consent. At the time of the hearing, the appealing party, the
Tax Administrator, and any other interested person may present such relevant
evidence as he or she may have relating to the determination from which the
appeal is taken.
   (D)   Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the
city’s files, the hearing officer shall issue a written notice and order
upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is
taken. The notice shall be given within 14 days after the conclusion of the
hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall specify
that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be
filed within 90 days from the date of the decision in accordance with Cal. Code
of Civil Procedure § 1094.6.

against any officer of the city to prevent or enjoin the collection under this
chapter of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected and/or
remitted.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
§ 5.74.180   Notice of changes to chapter.
   If a tax under this chapter is added repealed, increased, reduced, or the
tax base is changed, the Tax Administrator shall follow the notice requirements
of Cal. Public Utilities Code § 799.

§ 5.74.200   Independent audit of tax collection, exemption, remittance, and
expenditure.
   The city shall annually verify that the taxes owed under this chapter have
been properly applied, exempted, collected, and remitted in accordance with
this chapter, and properly expended according to applicable municipal law. The
annual verification shall be performed by a qualified independent third party

compliance, including the use of sampling audits. The verification shall not be
required of tax remitters where the cost of the verification may exceed the tax
revenues to be reviewed.
(Ord. 07-05, passed 6-5-2007)
§ 5.74.210   Interaction with prior tax.
   (a)   Satisfaction of tax obligation by service users. Any person who pays
the tax levied pursuant to §
5.74.030 of this code with respect to any charge for a communication service
shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied
pursuant to §§
5.76.020 and
5.76.060 of this code with respect to that charge. Likewise, prior to November
1, 2007, any person who pays the tax levied pursuant to §§
5.76.020 and
5.76.060 of this code with respect to any charge for a service shall be deemed
to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to §
5.74.030 of this code with respect to that charge. The intent of this division
is to prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge
during the transition period from the prior telephone and video users’ tax to
the new communication users’ tax (which transition period ends November 1,
2007) and to permit communications service providers, during that transition
period to satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax.
   (B)   Collection of tax by service providers. Service providers shall begin
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter as soon as feasible after the
effective date of the chapter, but in no event later than permitted by the Cal.
Public Utilities Code § 799.

any amendment provision that would increase the rate of any tax levied pursuant
to this chapter.

competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this chapter shall
nonetheless remain in full force and effect. The people hereby declare that
they would have adopted each section, division, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this chapter, irrespective of the fact that any one or more
sections, divisions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions of this chapter
be declared invalid or unenforceable.

§ 5.76.020   Constitutional and statutory exemptions.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon:
      (1)   Any person or service when the imposition of such tax upon such
person or service would be in violation of a federal or state statute, the
Constitution of the United States or the constitution of the state; and
      (2)   The city.
   (B)   Any person that is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter
pursuant to division (A) of this section shall file an application with the Tax
Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not
apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a
commonly recognized name, or is a service user of telephone communication
services that has received a federal excise tax exemption certificate for such
service. The application shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax
Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury,
which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of
all utility service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed exempt by
the Tax Administrator, such service user shall give the Tax Administrator
timely written notice of any change in utility service suppliers so that the
Tax Administrator can properly notify the new utility service supplier of the
service user’s tax exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this
section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users’ taxes collected and
remitted to the Tax Administrator from such service user as a result of such
noncompliance. Upon request of the Tax Administrator, a service supplier or
non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, shall provide a list of the
names and addresses of those customers which, according to its billing records,
are deemed exempt from the utility users’ tax. With respect to a service user
of telephone communication services, a service supplier of such telephone
communication services doing business in the city shall, upon request of the
Tax Administrator, provide a copy of the federal exemption certificate for each
exempt customer within the city that is served by such service supplier.
   (C)   The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to §
5.76.190 of this chapter. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and
appeal to the City Manager pursuant to §
5.76.190 of this chapter is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
   (D)   The City Council may, by resolution, establish one or more classes of
persons or one or more classes of utility service otherwise subject to payment
of a tax imposed by this chapter and provide that such classes of persons or
service shall be exempt, in whole or in part from such tax for a specified
period of time.
   (E)   The Tax Administrator shall prepare a list of the persons exempt from
the provisions of this chapter by virtue of this section and furnish a copy
thereof to each service supplier
(1995 Code, § 5.76.020) (Ord. 05-1958, passed - -2005)
§ 5.76.030   Telephone users’ tax.
   (A)   There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person in the city who uses
intrastate telephone communication services. The tax imposed by this section
shall be at the rate of seven percent of all charges made for such telephone
communication services. There is a rebuttable presumption that telephone
communication services, which are billed to a billing or service address in the
city, are used, in whole or in part, within the city’s boundaries, and such
services are subject to taxation under this chapter. If the billing address of
the service user is different from the service address, the service address of
the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax, regardless of
where the telephone communication service may originate, terminate, or pass
through.
   (B)   As used in this section, the term TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION SERVICES
shall not include PRIVATE MOBILE RADIO SERVICE, as defined in 47 C.F.R. part
20, or PRIVATE MOBILE SERVICE, as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(d)(3), which is
not interconnected with the public switched network or is not provided over
digital networks by which communications with a substantial portion of the
public is available (e.g., voice using internet protocol or VolP). The tax
imposed under division (A) above shall not be imposed upon any person for using
telecommunication services to the extent that, pursuant to the Internal Revenue
Code §§ 4252(d) and 4253, the amounts paid for such communication services are
exempt from or not subject to the tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code §
4251. In the event that the federal excise tax on communication services as
provided in the Internal Revenue Code §§ 4251, 4252 and 4253 is subsequently
repealed, any reference in this §
5.76.030 and in §
5.76.010 (telephone communication services) to such law, including any related
federal regulations, private letter rulings, case, law, and other opinions
interpreting these sections, shall refer to that body of law that existed
immediately prior to the date of repeal, as well as to any final published
decision by the U.S. Supreme Court or by a federal court in the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals interpreting such federal excise tax law.
   (C)   As used in this section, the term CHARGES shall include the value of
any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other
consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the telephone
communication services. As used in this section, the term CHARGES shall not
include charges for services paid for by inserting coins in coin-operated
telephones, except that where such coin-operated telephone service is furnished
for a guaranteed amount, the amounts paid under such guarantee, plus any fixed
monthly or other periodic charge, shall be included in the base for computing
the amount of tax due.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may issue and disseminate to
telecommunication service suppliers which are subject to the tax collection
requirements of this chapter, an administrative ruling, pursuant to §
5.76.160(B) of this chapter, identifying those telecommunication services that
are subject to the tax of division (A) above and/or identifies the sourcing of
such services for tax administration purposes. This administrative ruling shall
not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this
section, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by Cal. Government Code
§ 53750(h)(2)(A). An administrative ruling shall not constitute a new tax or an
increase in an existing tax if such administrative ruling is:
      (1)   Consistent with the existing ordinance language; and
      (2)   Merely reflects a change in, clarification to, or new rendition of:
         (a)   The definition, interpretation, or application of substantial
nexus by a court of competent jurisdiction or by preemptive state or federal
law, for purposes of taxation;
         (b)   The sourcing of taxable transactions based upon industry custom
and practice, which furthers administrative efficiency and minimizes multi-
jurisdictional taxation; or
         (c)   The definition, interpretation, or application of the federal
excise tax rules, regulations, and laws pertaining to COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
(26 U.S.C. §§ 4251, 4252 and 4253) by the Internal Revenue Service, or by the
Tax Administrator in assuming an interpretative role of those rules,
regulations, and laws in the event that the federal excise tax on
communications services is repealed.
   (E)   To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of telephone
communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user,
upon proof to the Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid
the same tax in another state or city on such telephone communication services,
shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount
of such tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the
amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the city under this section.
   (F)   The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the service
user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be
remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax
Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month.
   (G)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A) herein, the tax imposed
under this section shall not exceed the sum of $560 for any one calendar year
of service.

§ 5.76.040   Electricity users’ tax.
   (A)   There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using electricity in
the city. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of six percent
of the charges made for such electricity and for any supplemental services or
other associated activities directly related to and/or necessary for the
provision of electricity to the service user, which are provided by a service
supplier or non-utility service supplier to a service user.
   (B)   (1)   As used in this section, the term CHARGES shall apply to all
services, components and items that are:
         (a)   Necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of
electric service; or,
         (b)   Currently, or historically have been, included in a single or
bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of
retail customers.
      (2)   The term CHARGES shall include, but is not limited to, the

surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing.
   (C)   As used in this section, the term CHARGES shall include the value of
any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other
consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the electricity or

service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of
electric retail service that they commonly provide to residential and
commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor,
including those items that are mandated by state or federal regulatory agencies
as a condition of providing such electric service. The Tax Administrator,
thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such electric service suppliers an
administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are:
      (1)   Necessary or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric
service; or,
      (2)   Currently, or historically have been, included in a single or
bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of
retail customers. Unbundled charges for such components and items shall be
subject to the tax of division (A) above.
   (E)   As used in this section, the term USING ELECTRICITY shall not be
construed to include electricity used in water pumping by water corporations;
nor shall the term include the mere receiving of such electricity by an
electrical corporation at a point within the city for resale.
   (F)    The tax on electricity provided by self-production or by a non-
utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be
collected and remitted in the manner set forth in §
5.76.060. All other taxes imposed by this section shall be collected from the
service user by the electric service supplier or its billing agent. The amount
of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and
must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the 20th day of the
following month; or, at the option of the person required to collect and/or
remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by
the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service
user, which must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the 20th day
of the following month, provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted
payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within 60 days following each
calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the Tax Administrator, may be
applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due.
   (G)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A) hereinabove, the City
Council may, by Resolution, to be adopted on or before May 15 of each year,
reduce the tax rate of division (A) and/or adopt a maximum tax for certain
classes of customers, for the ensuing fiscal year as set forth in said
Resolution. Unless the City Council re-adopts said Resolution by May 15 of the
subsequent year the tax percentage reduction and any other actions taken (e.g.
establishment of a maximum tax) shall automatically expire and be discontinued,
and the original voter-approved tax percentage shall apply, without the
necessity of a vote of the people.

billing agent on the use of gas or electricity in the city, including any
related supplemental services, shall report the fact to the Tax Administrator
and shall remit the tax due directly to the Tax Administrator within 30 days of

made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.
Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the
full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a
proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been
paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of
refusal to pay the tax imposed on the charges, §
5.76.150 shall apply.
      (2)   The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service
user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period
applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such
regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a person
receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than
another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.
   (B)   Filing return and payment. Each person required by this chapter to
remit a tax shall file a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by
the Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax
collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional
information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being
levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are
due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Cal.
Revenue and Tax Code § 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall
maintain such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from
the disclosure provisions of the Public Records Act.

first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct
deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of
electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service
supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this division shall be
considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and
the transfer settles into the city’s account on the following business day.
   (B)   If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users’ tax
fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more
services or charges on the customer’s billing) or fails to remit the tax
collected on or before the due date, or, in the case of a service user that
fails to properly self-collect and remit the tax under §
5.76.060 of this chapter on or before the due date, the Tax Administrator shall
attach a penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of 15% of
the total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay
interest at the rate of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent, until paid.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional
penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or
remitting at the rate of 15% of the amount of the tax collected and/or required

   (D)   For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest
that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become, a part of
the tax herein required to be paid.

§ 5.76.130   Actions to collect.
   Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such
tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax
Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to
collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person
owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to
an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount,
including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with
any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person’s
noncompliance with this chapter; including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed
by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11
U.S.C. § 507(a)(8)(C).

the tax to one or more taxable services or charges.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency
determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice
shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate
of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the
date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within 14 calendar
days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in
writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter.
   (C)   If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time
period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final
assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the city. If the person
requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for
hearing, which shall be scheduled within 30 days after receipt of the written
request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person at least ten calendar days prior
to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires the person to produce
specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records
requested to be produced.
   (D)   At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear
all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested
parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be
continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of
additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the
hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-
assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original
deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to
person owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed

§ 5.76.150   Administrative remedy_Non-paying service users.
   (A)   Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has
deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the
amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax
Administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve
such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from
certain named service users for specific billing periods. To the extent the
service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two or
more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation
to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the city with the
names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under
the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency
penalty at the rate of 15% of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay
interest at the rate of 0.75% per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the
Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for
the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and
interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery
or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the
person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change
of address, to his or her last known address.
   (D)   If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator
within 30 days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the
Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of 15% of the amount of the
total tax that is owed.

directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations
not inconsistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of
interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection
and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such administrative rules
and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office. The
adoption of an administrative ruling by Tax Administrator, pursuant to this
division (B) shall not constitute an “extension” or “increase” of the tax
imposed by this chapter, provided that the administrative ruling does not cause
the percentage rate of the tax to exceed the percentage rates set forth in this
chapter (as authorized by California Constitution Chapter XIIIC, Section 2(d),
and Cal. Government Code § 53750(h)(2)).
   (C)   Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make
administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict
requirements of this chapter and thereby:
      (1)   Conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier
(or service user subject to §
5.76.060 of this chapter) so long as the agreements result in the collection of
the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or
      (2)   To avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection
and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement
shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office, and are voidable by the Tax
Administrator or the city at any time.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to
collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax Administrator
shall notify the person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the
absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review
shall not exceed a period of three years next preceding the date of receipt of
the written notice by the person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of
the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant
to §
5.76.140 of this chapter for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest)
owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the
Tax Administrator. If the person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient
records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter,
the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the
deficiency. The reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable
presumption of correctness.
   (E)   Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause,
the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required
pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed 45 days, provided that
the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the
request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason
of such extension. Interest shall accrue during the extension at the rate of
0.75% per month, prorated for any portion thereof.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person
who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this
chapter.
   (G)   (1)   The City Manager may compromise a claim made pursuant to this
chapter in accordance with the authority set forth in Tulare Municipal Code §
5.76.120.

the City Attorney, may compromise a claim pursuant to this chapter where the
portion of the claim proposed to be released is less than $5,000; and, with the
approval of the City Attorney and the City Council, may compromise such a claim
where the portion proposed to be released is equal to or greater than $5,000.
   (H)   Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the Tax
Administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required
to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this chapter
if the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-
collection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into
consideration industry practice or other precedence.

§ 5.76.170   Records.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit
to the city any tax imposed by this chapter, to keep and preserve, for a period
of at least three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the

remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator shall
have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.
   (B)   The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to
deliver to the Tax Administrator copies of all records deemed necessary by the
Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the
delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if
such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary
course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to
the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative
subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the city on or
before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the city for all
reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect those records,
including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the
normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to
conduct the inspection.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure
agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the confidentiality of
customer information pursuant to Cal. Revenue and Tax Code §§ 7284.6 and
7284.7. The Tax Administrator may request from a person providing
transportation services of gas or electricity to service users within the city
a list of the names and addresses, and other pertinent information, of its
transportation customers within the city pursuant to Cal. Public Utilities Code
§ 6354(e).
   (D)   If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to
bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall:
      (1)   Provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone
number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by,
the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and
      (2)   Upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the
delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent
or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is
necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or
remittance of such tax to the city.
   (E)   (1)   If any person subject to record-keeping under this section
unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator access to such records, or fails to
produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time
specified, then the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of $500 on such
person for each day following:
         (a)   The initial date that the person refuses to provide such access;
or
         (b)   The due date for production of records as set forth in the
administrative subpoena.
       (2)   This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed
under this chapter.

section.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid or
paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received
by the Tax Administrator under this chapter, provided that no refund shall be
paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her
guardian, conservator, executor, or administrator has submitted a written claim
to the Tax Administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or
illegal collection of the tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant’s
right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto.
   (B)   The submission of a written claim, which is acted upon by the City
Council, shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon. (See Cal. Government Code §
935.) The Tax Administrator, or the City Council where the claim is in excess
of $5,000, shall act upon the refund claim within the time period set forth in
Cal. Government Code § 912.4. If the Tax Administrator/City Council fails or
refuses to act on a refund claim within the time prescribed by Cal. Government
Code § 912.4, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the City
Council on the last day of the period within which the City Council was
required to act upon the claim as provided in Cal. Government Code § 912.4. The
Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form which substantially
complies with that set forth in Cal. Government Code § 913. Nothing herein
shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the notice provisions of division (A) of this section,

due to overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of the tax), may refund
such amount to the service user, or credit to charges subsequently payable by
the service user to the service supplier, and claim credit for such overpayment
against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns to the
Tax Administrator, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later
than one year from the date of overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection
of said tax. The Tax Administrator shall determine the validity of the service
user’s claim of credit, and the underlying basis for such claim.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the notice provisions of division (A) of this section,
in the event that a service supplier, or a service user subject to §
5.76.060 of this chapter, remits a tax to city in excess of the amount of tax
imposed by this chapter, the service supplier, or service user subject to §
5.76.060 of this chapter, may claim credit for such overpayment against the
amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns to the Tax
Administrator, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than
one year from the date of overpayment of the tax. The Tax Administrator shall
determine the validity of the service user’s claim of credit, and the
underlying basis for such claim.
   (E)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service
supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission,
makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services, the taxes
paid pursuant to this chapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall also
be refunded to service users, and the service supplier shall be entitled to
claim a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due
upon the next monthly returns. In the event this chapter is repealed, the
amounts of any refundable taxes will be borne by the city.
   (F)   A service user who desires to obtain the benefits of the maximum tax
limitations in §§
5.76.030(G),
5.76.040(G),
5.76.050(G),
5.76.060(F) and

claimant must establish his or her right to a refund by written records or
other relevant evidence.

§ 5.78.010   Purpose.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Transactions and Use Tax for General
Purposes Ordinance”. The City of Tulare shall hereinafter be called “city”.
This ordinance shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of the city.
This chapter of the Tulare Municipal Code has been adopted for the following
(and other) purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in
order to accomplish those purposes:
   (A)   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.6 (commencing with § 7251)
of Division 2 and § 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city
to adopt this chapter which shall be operative if a majority of the electors
voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election
called for that purpose;
   (B)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Part
1.6 of Division 2;
   (C)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by
the state’s Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practical to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the state’s Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Transactions
and Use Taxes;
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the
provisions of Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code Parts 1.6 and 1.7 of Division 2,
minimize the cost of collecting city transactions and use taxes, and at the
same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to
taxation under the provisions thereof; and
   (E)   To provide a source of revenue to be used by the city for general
purposes. There shall be no legal obligation created by this chapter for use of
the funds for specific purposes.

   (B)   Each person owing cannabis business tax for a calendar quarter shall,

of the Constitutions of the United States or the State of California or a
violation of any other provision of the California Constitution or state law.

under applicable law, he or she may request that the Tax Administrator release
him or her from the obligation to pay the impermissible portion of the tax.

§ 5.104.010 Purpose and intent.
   (A)   In enacting this chapter, the City Council recognizes that commercial
massage therapy is a professional pursuit that can offer the public valuable
health and therapeutic services. The City Council further recognizes that,
unless properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of
massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat
to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose
and intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by
providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy
services, discouraging prostitution, sex trafficking and related illegal
activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing
certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses.
   (B)   Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to address
the negative impacts identified in the City Council’s findings to reduce or
prevent neighborhood blight and to protect and preserve the quality of city
neighborhoods and commercial districts; and to enhance enforcement of criminal
statutes relating to the conduct of operators and employees of massage
businesses.
   (C)   It is the Council’s further purpose and intent to rely upon the
uniform statewide regulations applicable to massage practitioners and
establishments that were enacted by the State Legislature in 2008 as Cal.
Business and Professions Code §§ 4600 et seq., by Senate Bill 731, and amended
in 2011 by Assembly Bill 619, and in 2014 by Assembly Bill 1147, to restrict
the commercial practice of massage in the city to those persons duly certified
to practice by the California Massage Therapy Council, and to provide for the
registration and regulation of massage businesses for health and safety
purposes to the extent allowed by law.

his or her discretion.
   (D)   Effective date of suspension or revocation. Suspension or revocation

to the City Council, a continuance of the hearing. Such requests must be
supported by good cause. The decision whether to grant a continuance is at the
discretion of the City Council, which shall consider whether granting the
continuance poses a threat to public health or safety in light of the severity
of the violations alleged.
      (6)   The decision of the City Council shall be final, with no further
administrative right of appeal or reconsideration. The City Council may sustain
a suspension or revocation, overrule a suspension or revocation, reduce a
revocation to a suspension, and/or reduce the length of a suspension. Further,
the City Council may stay the effective date of any suspension for a reasonable
time following a hearing.
   (F)   Re-application. No re-application will be accepted within one year
after a certificate is revoked.

   (E)   The owner or custodian must maintain the certificate of vaccination,
or a copy thereof, and must, upon demand of a public or peace officer acting
within the course and scope of his or her employment, display said certificate
for examination.

requirements in this section so long as the dog is kept in strict confinement
and isolated at all times and so long as the medical condition is proven to
exist. The written proof must also contain an estimated date when the dog can

      (2)   Pursuant to § 31254 of the Cal. Food and Agricultural Code, the

§ 6.12.360 Potentially dangerous and vicious animals.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to regulate the keeping of animals
which are potentially dangerous or vicious or involve a threat to the safety of
people and other animals on streets, sidewalks, and private property where the
animals are not properly maintained as such animals constitute a serious hazard
within the City of Tulare. The increasing tendency to maintain animals which,
by virtue of breeding or training, have a propensity to attack others,
compounds the hazard.
      (2)   Every owner or custodian of an animal is held strictly accountable
for the exercise of such control over the animal as necessary to ensure that
the animal does not injure innocent human beings or other animals that are not
on the premises where the animal is maintained. Such strict accountability is
imposed whether or not the injury results from the negligence or fault of the
owner or custodian, and regardless of the degree of precaution or control
exercised by the owner or custodian.
   (B)   Owner responsible.
      (1)   Any owner or custodian of any animal is deemed responsible for the
acts committed by that animal when the owner or custodian has failed to comply
with the legal requirements for the keeping of that animal as defined in this
chapter. No person shall permit an animal to act in such a manner as
constitutes potentially dangerous or vicious behavior as defined in §
6.12.050 of this chapter.
      (2)   A violation of any of the provisions of this section is punishable
as follows:
         (a)   On a first offence, any animal owner who maintains an animal in
such a manner as to permit it to exhibit potentially dangerous behavior shall
be guilty of an infraction.
         (b)   On the second and subsequent offence, any animal owner who
maintains any animal in such a manner as to permit it to exhibit vicious
behavior shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall prevent prosecution for violations of
other statutes or codes which may deal with other or more specific offenses,
including but not limited to, penal and civil statutes.
   (C)   Quarantine or impound. No animal which has been declared potentially
dangerous or vicious or against which a potentially dangerous or vicious animal
report has been filed may be impounded or quarantined at any place other than
Animal Services, unless authorized by the Animal Services Manager.
   (D)   Notice of escape. Any person keeping, harboring, maintaining, or
owning a potentially dangerous animal, vicious animal, or wild animal that
escapes from its confinement shall immediately notify Animal Services.
Notification shall first be by phone and shall be followed with written
notification within one business day, via email to Animal Services, which
includes the following information, as known:
      (1)   The date, place, and time of the animal's escape;
      (2)   A description of the animal, including a photo, and its condition
at the time of escape; and
      (3)   The name, address, and residential and occupational telephone
numbers of the owner of the animal.
   (E)   Filling of a complaint. Any person, including employees of Animal
Services, possessing personal knowledge of facts that there exists a
potentially dangerous or vicious animal within the incorporated area of the
city or those contracted areas served by Animal Services may file with Animal
Services a written report, signed under the penalty of perjury, which contains
the following facts:
      (1)   A description of the offending animal including, to the extent
known, the color, size, sex, breed and name of the animal, and the name and
address of the animal owner or custodian;
      (2)   An assertion that the animal described is a potentially dangerous
or vicious within the meaning of §
6.12.050, together with a statement of the facts upon which the assertion was
based, including the name and address of any person who has been victimized or
injured, including a description of the extent of the injuries, the names and
addresses of the witnesses thereto, the time, date, and location of the
incident related to the assertion, and an explanation of how the personal
knowledge of the affiant was acquired; and
      (3)   The name, residential and occupational addresses and telephone
numbers of the affiant.
   (F)   Timely filing. Unless otherwise provided, the filing of a potentially
dangerous or vicious animal report must be made within five business days, of
the most recent event or circumstances occasioning the report. Upon evidence
that good cause exists that a report could not be filed within the five
business days, the Animal Services Manager may extend the deadline for filing
the report.
   (G)   Impoundment of animal. Upon receipt by Animal Services of a
potentially dangerous or vicious animal report, Animal Services shall initiate
an investigation of the incident or incidents described in the report for the
purpose of verifying the facts stated and obtaining other information. If,
after an investigation, the identified facts show the existence of a
potentially dangerous or vicious animal, Animal Services shall immediately
locate and impound the animal which is the subject of the charges and the owner
or custodian shall have to request a hearing within five business days, from
date of impoundment.
      (1)   All sheltering fees to date, including the hearing request fees,
shall be paid in full by the owner or custodian prior to acceptance of the
hearing request.
      (2)   Failure to pay all associated fees after five business days will
result in a forfeit of the appeal.

request for a hearing and shall notify the victim and the Chief of Police of
such hearing.
         (a)   The hearing shall be set no more than ten business days from
date of notice of hearing.

      (3)   The owner or custodian may be represented by counsel at their own
discretion and cost. If Animal Services plans to be represented by counsel,
such fact will be made clear to the owner or custodian upon writing regarding
the time and place of the hearing. Animal Services representation by counsel
does not in any way entitle the owner or custodian to be represented by
counsel.
      (4)   The burden is on the animal owner or custodian to present evidence
that the animal is not potentially dangerous or vicious.
      (5)   The technical rules of evidence shall not be applicable to the

hearsay evidence.
      (6)   The Hearing Officer may find, based upon the preponderance of the
evidence, that:
         (a)   The animal is not potentially dangerous or vicious and should be
returned to its owner or custodian;
         (b)   The animal is not potentially dangerous or vicious but that the
attack, bite, or injury was the result of improper or negligent training,
handling, or maintenance and that the license should be revoked and the animal
relinquished to Animal Services;
         (c)   The animal is potentially dangerous or vicious but may be
returned to the owner or custodian with stipulations and/or restrictions; or
         (d)   The animal is potentially dangerous or vicious and that it
should be humanely euthanized no sooner than the fifth business day following
the mailing of notice of determination.
      (7)   The Hearing Officer shall make other orders required or authorized
by this chapter.
      (8)   The Hearing Officer may decide all issues for or against the owner
or custodian of the animal even if the owner or custodian fails to appear at
the hearing. Failure to appear at the hearing will be deemed a forfeiture of
the animal.
   (C)   Consideration of evidence. In considering whether an animal is
potentially dangerous and/or vicious, the Hearing Officer shall consider
evidence including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Any previous history of the animal attacking, biting or causing
injury to a human being or other animal.
      (2)   The nature and extent of injuries inflicted and the number of
victims involved.
      (3)   The location where the bite, attack or injury occurred.
      (4)   The presence or absence of any provocation for the bite, attack, or
injury.
      (5)   The extent to which property has been damaged or destroyed.
      (6)   Whether the animal exhibits any characteristics of being trained

animal.
      (11)   Any other relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner or
custodian to protect the public safety in the future if the animal is permitted
to remain in the city.
   (D)   Mitigating circumstances. In considering whether an animal is
potentially dangerous and/or vicious, the Hearing Officer may hear and consider
evidence of any of the following mitigating circumstances:
      (1)   That the injury or damage complained of was sustained by a person
who was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied
by the owner or custodian of the animal, or was teasing, tormenting, abusing,
or assaulting the animal, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime.
      (2)   That the animal was protecting or defending a person within the
immediate vicinity of the animal from an unjustified attack or assault.
      (3)   That the injury or damage complained of was sustained by a domestic
animal which at the time of the injury or damage was teasing, tormenting,
abusing, or assaulting the animal which is the subject of the hearing.
      (4)   The injury or damage complained of was to a domestic animal and was
sustained while the animal in question was working as a hunting animal, herding
animal, or predator control animal on the property of, or under the control of,
its owner or custodian and the damage or injury complained of was to a species
or type of domestic animal appropriate to the work of the animal.
   (E)   Determinations and orders—Notice—Compliance—Appeal—Finality of appeal.
      (1)   Within ten calendar days after the hearing is conducted, the
Hearing Officer shall notify in writing Animal Services and the owner or
custodian of the determination and orders issued, by first class mail or

CHAPTER 6.32: STREET RACES AND RECKLESS DRIVING EXHIBITIONS PROHIBITED
Section
   
6.32.010   Purpose.
   
6.32.020   Definitions.
   
6.32.030   Street races and reckless driving exhibitions prohibited.
   
6.32.040   Spectators at street races and reckless driving exhibitions
prohibited.
   
6.32.050   Proving a violation—Spectators at street races or reckless driving
exhibitions.
§ 6.32.010    Purpose.
   (A)   The Tulare City Council finds and declares that pursuant to Cal.
Vehicle Code §§ 23103 et seq., and 23109 et seq., motor vehicle speed contests,
reckless driving, exhibitions of speed conducted on public streets and
highways, and reckless driving conducted on public streets, highways, and off-
street parking facilities, are illegal under California law. Motor vehicle
speed contests and exhibitions of speed are more commonly referred to as street
races. Common acts of reckless driving often occur during, or when preparations
are being made for, such illegal street races. This includes pre-race events
referred to as “sideshows” or motorcycle “stunting” in which groups of people
block streets and sidewalks to form sideshow or stunt areas in conjunction with
street races. Streets and off-street parking facilities within the City of
Tulare have been the site(s) of continued and escalating illegal street races,
sideshows, and motorcycle stunting over the past several years.
   (B)   Street races, sideshows, and motorcycle stunting pose an immediate
threat to the health and safety of the public, interfere with pedestrian and
vehicular traffic, create a public nuisance, and inhibit private business
owners from enjoying the use of their property within the City of Tulare.
Groups of racers, sideshow participants, stunters, and spectators gather on the
streets and in off-street parking facilities late at night and in the early
morning hours. Among other things, these groups block traffic on the streets
and sidewalks in order to form a racetrack, “sideshow,” or stunt area, place
bets and wagers, and otherwise encourage, aid and abet the street racing
process.
   (C)   Illegal street racers accelerate to high speeds without regard to
oncoming traffic, pedestrians, or other vehicles. The racers drive quickly from
street to street, race for several hours, and then move to different locations
upon the arrival of police. Participants in these illegal activities use cell
phones, police scanners, and other electronic devices to communicate with each
other in order to avoid arrest. Social media and other websites are used to
provide information on where to race and how to avoid detection and
prosecution. These activities have resulted in an increase in traffic
accidents, property crimes, and calls for police service. Illegal street
racing, sideshows, and motorcycle stunting attract many spectators, and the
presence of spectators at these events encourages street racing to continue and
creates an environment in which illegal activities can flourish.
   (D)   This chapter makes it a violation of the City of Tulare Municipal Code
to participate in a street race or reckless driving exhibition on or in a
public highway or off-street parking facility. This chapter also makes it a
violation of the City of Tulare Municipal Code to be a spectator at, otherwise
encourage, aid and abet the street racing process, or be present when
preparations are being made for, a street race or reckless driving exhibition.
This chapter further provides that evidence of specified prior acts are
admissible as evidence to show the propensity of a criminal defendant to be
present at or attend illegal street races or reckless driving exhibitions, if
the prior act(s) occurred within three years of the presently charged offense.
This chapter is adopted to prohibit spectators at illegal street races and
reckless driving exhibitions in order to significantly decrease this criminal
activity. It targets a clear, limited population and gives proper notice to
citizens as to which activities are unlawful.

§ 6.52.010   Purpose.
   (A)   Graffiti abatement. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the
prompt abatement of graffiti from public and private properties in the city; to
provide for methods of controlling the unauthorized use of aerosol paint
containers, wide-tipped marker pens, and paint sticks by minors; and to
encourage citizens to report occurrences of graffiti vandalism within the city.
   (B)   Nuisance declared. Due to the increase of graffiti vandalism on both
public and private property, a condition has arisen within the city which has
resulted in a deterioration of property values and concern for the quality of
life of the city’s citizens. The City Council finds and determines that
graffiti constitutes a public nuisance which, left unabated, adversely affects
the city’s image, business development, retail sales, and residential housing
costs. Allowing graffiti to remain on public or private property encourages
additional unacceptable occurrences of graffiti, fuels fear among the community
and is a factor which not only depreciates the value of the property which has
been the target of such vandalism, but also depreciates the value of adjacent
and surrounding properties.
   (C)   Minimize impact. The purpose of this chapter is, therefore, to
minimize the impact which graffiti has on the city’s quality of life, economic
stability, environmental image, aesthetic standard, and the overall sense of
feeling of safety and security of its citizens. Because the existence of
graffiti tends to breed community discontent and criminal and gang-related
activities, the chapter will serve to mitigate these problems through quick
removal and control of graffiti vandalism.

      (2)   Nothing herein shall relieve such person or business entity from,

posting signs as described therein.

   (A)   General. Any person applying graffiti within the city shall have the
duty to remove same in a manner approved by the city and the property owner
within 24 hours after notice by the city or public or private owner of the
property involved. Failure of any person to so remove graffiti shall constitute
an additional violation of this chapter. Consistent with Cal. Civil Code §
1714.1 where graffiti is applied by minors, the parent or guardian shall be
responsible for such removal or payment of costs thereof.
   (B)   Public property. Whenever the City Manager, or his or her designated
representative, determines that graffiti exists upon property owned by the
city, it shall be removed as soon as possible. When the property is owned by a
public entity other than the city, the removal of the graffiti may be
authorized by the City Manager, or his or her designated representative, and

graffiti promptly from the property and to restore the property at least to the
condition it was in prior to such act of vandalism. If the property owner fails
to promptly remove the graffiti, the city shall cause a written notice to be
served upon the owner of the affected property notifying the owner of the
location and description of the graffiti and of the property owner’s obligation
to remove the graffiti. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to
commence removal of the graffiti described in the notice within five days of
service or personal delivery of the notice, and to diligently and promptly
pursue total removal of the graffiti; provided that, an exception may exist in
cases of undue hardship as established pursuant to division (C)(2) of this
section. The service is complete at the time of deposit of the notice in the
U.S. mail or by personal delivery of the notice to the owner of the property
subject to removal of graffiti. The failure of any person to receive such
notice shall not affect the validity of any proceeding.
      (2)   Undue hardship; optional procedure for removal.
         (a)   In the event the property owner cannot comply with the
requirement of division (C)(1) above, due to hardship, the property owner shall
file a written request for waiver of the removal requirement with the city. The
property owner shall explain his or her reason(s) for making such request. The
written request shall be filed within the five-day removal period stated in
division (C)(1) above. In determining whether the request for waiver will be
granted, and subsequent assistance provided to the property owner in removal of
the graffiti, the city shall consider the following circumstances:
            1.   The cost of restoration of the property to its original state
prior to the imposition of the graffiti in proportion to the relative value of
the property;
            2.   The ability of the owner to pay for such removal;
            3.   Whether or not the property has been the target of previous
incidents of graffiti or whether a pattern of vandalism to such property
exists.
         (b)   The decision of the city in the form of a written decision by
the City Manager, as to whether or not to grant the waiver shall be final.
      (3)   City’s release from liability. A written request to waive the
requirements of division (C)(1) above shall be accompanied by a “release from
liability” form signed by the property owner which shall release the city and
its authorized agents from any and all liability that may be caused or
attributed to removal of graffiti from the owner’s premises by persons acting
under the authorization of the city.
      (4)   Approval for city to remove graffiti. A written request to waive
the requirements of division (C)(1) above accompanied by a signed “release from
liability” form shall constitute an express approval by the property owner that
the city or its authorized representatives may provide for the removal of the
graffiti on owner’s property by persons acting under the authorization of the
city.
      (5)   Failure to remove graffiti or seek waiver of removal. In the event
the owner fails to remove graffiti from his or her property and fails to
request a waiver of such removal, the city may declare the property a public
nuisance and the city may take any of the following courses of action.
         (a)   Administrative procedure to abate nuisance. The city may direct
the removal of graffiti from the property with the cost of work performed
billed to the property owner who may select the option of direct payment of
such costs. Failure to make direct payment for the abatement of graffiti shall
constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel plat to
which it relates. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to
the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as
provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the
special assessment. Upon completion of the graffiti abatement work, the City
Manager shall cause to be recorded in the office of the Recorder of Tulare
County, a “notice of completion of graffiti abatement proceedings” against a
particular parcel involved. The notice of completion of graffiti abatement
proceedings shall have the effect, when recorded, of conclusively establishing
that graffiti abatement proceedings have been completed and that all
proceedings have been completed and that all necessary charges incurred on
account thereof by the city are due and owing and constitute a special
assessment against the subject real property. This notice shall specify the
name of the current owner of the parcel as shown on the last equalized
assessment rolls of the County of Tulare, and the Tulare County Assessor’s
parcel number for the parcel involved.
         (b)   The city may commence criminal proceedings to abate a public
nuisance under applicable Penal Code provisions.

§ 6.52.070   Appeal of cost of removal.
   A property owner shall have 15 days from the date of mailing by the city of
the bill for the cost of removal of graffiti from the owner’s property to file
a written appeal of the costs. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the
City Clerk. Upon receipt of the written appeal, the City Clerk shall schedule a
hearing before the City Council. The City Manager shall be so notified and
shall submit a written report to the City Council, with a copy to the appealing
party, setting forth justifications for the description of the work done and
the cost thereof. The City Clerk shall notify the party appealing of the date
and time of the hearing before the City Council, at least ten days in advance
of such hearing. At the time and place of such hearing, the City Manager shall
present his or her report and the appealing party shall present any and all
information in opposition to the calculation of the cost of removal. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the City Council shall determine what cost, if any,
is to be imposed upon the appealing party.

conviction of any person for violation, within the city, of Cal. Penal Code §§
594 or 594.3 by the use of graffiti, Cal. Penal Code §§ 640, 640.5, 640.6. In
the event of multiple contributions of information, the reward amount shall be
divided by the city in the manner it shall deem appropriate. For the purposes
of this section, diversion of the violator to a community service program, a
plea bargain to a lesser offense, or the sustaining of any juvenile petition

§ 6.70.010 Findings.
   (A)   Underage persons consuming alcoholic beverages at gatherings held at
private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises is harmful
to the underage persons themselves and a threat to the peace, health, safety,
quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare of the public.
Underage persons, who have been consuming alcoholic beverages, are at greater
risk to be in automobile accidents and otherwise harm themselves and/or others,
to commit suicide, to be assaulted or assault others, and girls are at greater
risk of sexual assaults.
   (B)   Persons responsible for the occurrence of these types of gatherings on
private property over which they have possession or control have failed to
ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage
persons at these parties.
   (C)   Problems associated with gatherings involving underage persons
drinking alcohol are difficult to prevent and deter. Police need an arsenal of
tools to deal with the issue of underage drinking and its attendant problems.
If persons are held civilly responsible by having to pay a significant fine for
hosting a party where there is underage drinking, they will be more likely to
properly supervise or stop such conduct at events held on property under their
possession or control.
   (D)   In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency
response services personnel have and are required to respond, sometimes on
multiple occasions, to these types of gatherings. The repeated return of police
officers to the location of an event constitutes a drain of emergency personnel
and resources, often leaving other areas of the city without police protection
or with unreasonably limited protection. Responses to such gatherings also
result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the
city, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its
taxpayers and residents.
   (E)   The service of alcohol to underage persons at loud and unruly
gatherings and the consumption of alcohol by underage persons at loud or unruly
gatherings has in the past and continues to pose a threat to the health and
safety of all persons who reside in the city, is a drain on the city’s public
safety resources and also causes significant disruption of city residents’
quiet enjoyment of their households, especially in the city’s residential
neighborhoods. It is therefore the policy of the City Council that in
responding to loud or unruly gatherings, the city Police Department shall
strictly enforce any and all applicable local and state laws pertaining to the
service of alcohol to underage persons, and the consumption of alcohol by
underage persons, and with respect to underage persons in possession of
alcohol, the Police Department shall establish a “no tolerance” protocol by
which the Police Department contacts, or causes the underage person’s school to
contact, the underage person’s parents or legal guardians whenever the underage
person is found to be in possession of alcohol or narcotics or found to be
intoxicated at a loud or unruly gathering. Where the underage person’s school
has an internal student disciplinary office any such incident shall likewise be
reported to that office.
(Ord. 12-06, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 6.70.020 Authority and purpose.
   This chapter is adopted under the municipal affairs provisions of the City
Charter for the purpose of establishing standards and controls to enforce laws
prohibiting the service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage
persons; to protect public health, safety, general welfare and quiet enjoyment
of residential property and properties neighboring one of these gatherings; to
discourage and deter persons from hosting or improperly supervising a party
where there is underage drinking; and to establish standards and controls of
parties, gatherings or assemblages involving underage persons consuming
alcoholic beverages on private property when such gatherings are determined to
be a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, or require
initial police response and return calls to the location to disperse
uncooperative participants.
(Ord. 12-06, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 6.70.030 Definitions.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
   ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE. Alcohol, spirits, liquor, wine, beer, and every liquid

owned, leased, rented, or used with or without compensation.
   RESPONSIBLE PERSON. A person or persons with a right of possession of the
residence or other private property at which an unruly gathering is conducted.
A RESPONSIBLE PERSON need not be present at such gathering and prior knowledge
of the unruly gathering is not a prerequisite to a finding that any specific
individual is a RESPONSIBLE PERSON as defined by this section. This chapter
therefore imposes vicarious as well as direct liability upon RESPONSIBLE
PERSONS. A RESPONSIBLE PERSON includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Owner(s) and/or lessee(s) of the property where an unruly gathering
is taking place, including the record owner of the title to property, wherever
that person or entity may currently reside;

      (6)   Person(s) in charge of the private property.
   UNDERAGE PERSON. Any person under 21 years of age.
   UNRULY GATHERING. A party, event or gathering where four or more underage
persons are present at a private property in which alcoholic beverages are
being consumed or possessed by any underage person and upon which unruly
conduct occurs. Illustrative of such unruly conduct is excessive noise,
excessive traffic, obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles, public
drunkenness or unlawful public consumption of alcohol or alcoholic beverages,
assaults, batteries, fights, or other disturbances of  peace, vandalism,
litter, and any other conduct which constitute a threat to peace, public
health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property or general welfare.
(Ord. 12-06, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 6.70.040 Public nuisance.
   (A)   Any unruly gathering shall constitute a public nuisance and an
immediate threat to public health and safety.
   (B)   As a public nuisance, the unruly gathering may be summarily abated by
police by all reasonable means, singularly or in combination, including, but
not limited to:
      (1)   An order requiring the gathering to be disbanded;
      (2)   An assessment of a civil penalty under this chapter; and
      (3)   The issuance of a criminal citation or the arrest of any law
violators under any applicable ordinances or statutes.
(Ord. 12-06, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 6.70.050 Civil penalties.
   (A)   Any and all responsible persons of an unruly gathering shall be

      (2)   A second violation occurring at the same private property within
one year of the first cited violation; and
      (3)   A third and any further violation occurring at the same private
property within one year of the first cited violation.
   (C)   If the owner of the private property where an unruly gathering has
occurred has leased the property to another person, such owner shall not be
considered a responsible person until that owner receives notice of at least
one previous unruly gathering on his or her property in the prior 12 months.
Notice shall be by a copy of the administrative citation transmitted via
certified mail to the owner of the private property as recorded by the last
equalized assessment roll of the Tulare County Assessor.
   (D)   In the event that an unruly gathering is hosted by a juvenile, then
the parents or guardians of that juvenile will be jointly and severally liable
for any civil penalty assessed on the juvenile under this section.
   (E)   The fine schedule prescribed at division (B) of this section is a
“rolling schedule” meaning that in calculating the fine payable the Police
Department or City Attorney shall count backward starting from the date of the
most recent loud or unruly gathering to determine how many prior loud or unruly
gatherings have taken place at the premises in question during the statutory
12-month period. A warning given pursuant to §
6.80.040 shall remain in effect for the premises at a given address until a
full 12-month period has elapsed during which there have been no loud or unruly
gatherings at those premises.
(Ord. 12-06, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 6.70.060 Emergency response cost liability.

makes an initial response to an unruly gathering at a private property, the
official shall, in writing, warn any responsible person(s) for the gathering at
the scene that:
      (1)   The official has determined that an unruly gathering exists; and
      (2)   If emergency response providers make any further emergency
responses to the same location for an unruly gathering within one year of the
initial response, the responsible person(s) will be charged for the costs of
providing those emergency responses.
   (B)   When a law enforcement, fire, or other emergency response provider
responds to any unruly gathering at a private property within one year after
the warning in division (A) of this section has been given, any and all
responsible persons shall be jointly and severally liable for the city’s costs
of providing those emergency responses. If the responsible person is a
juvenile, then the juvenile’s parents or guardians shall be liable for the
emergency response cost. This liability is in addition to any civil penalty
authorized under this chapter.
   (C)   The emergency response costs incurred under this section shall be
deemed a debt owed to the city and are due 30 days after receipt of the bill. A
bill will be deemed received five days after the date posted on the bill which
is mailed by placing first class postage on the envelope and mailing it to the
address provided by the responsible party to the law enforcement, fire or other
emergency response provider or to the address where the unruly gathering took
place. Any responsible person owing such debt shall be liable in a civil action
brought in the name of the city for recovery of such debt, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs. The bill shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The name(s) of the person(s) being held liable for the payment of
such costs;
      (2)   The address of the private property where the unruly gathering

§ 6.80.010 Findings.
   (A)   Loud and unruly gatherings held at private residences or at rented
residential and commercial premises or on public property are harmful to the
persons themselves and a threat to the peace, health, safety, quiet enjoyment
of residential property and the general welfare of the public. Persons at these
gatherings are at greater risk to harm themselves and/or others, to be
assaulted or assault others, and girls are at greater risk of sexual assaults.
   (B)   Problems associated with loud and unruly gatherings are difficult to
prevent and deter. Police need an arsenal of tools to deal with the issue of
these gatherings and their attendant problems. If persons are held civilly
responsible by having to pay a significant fine for gathering where there is
loud and unruly behavior, they will be more likely to properly supervise or

   (C)   In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency

officers to the location of an event constitutes a drain of emergency personnel

residence or other private or public property at which an unruly gathering is
conducted.
   (A)   A RESPONSIBLE PERSON includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Owner(s) and/or lessee(s) of the property where an unruly gathering
is taking place, including the record owner of the title to property, wherever
that person or entity may currently reside;
      (2)   Permittee(s) if the gathering is a permitted gathering on public
property;
      (3)   Person(s) hosting or accepting responsibility for an unruly

RESPONSIBLE PERSON;
      (6)   Tenant of the residence or other private property; and
      (7)   Person(s) in charge of the private property.
   (B)   To incur liability for special security service charges imposed by
this chapter the RESPONSIBLE PERSON need not be present at the loud or unruly
gathering resulting in the emergency response giving rise to the imposition of
special security service charges and prior knowledge of the unruly gathering is
not a prerequisite to a finding that any specific individual is a RESPONSIBLE
PERSON as defined by this section. This chapter therefore imposes vicarious as
well as direct liability upon RESPONSIBLE PERSONS.

emergency response service to a loud or unruly gathering within 12 months of a
first response as provided in this chapter.
   UNDERAGE PERSON. Any person under 21 years of age.

premises in the city with a given address, the officer shall issue a written
warning to any responsible person at the scene that:
      (1)   The officer has determined that a loud or unruly gathering exists;
and
      (2)   Responsible persons will be charged for the cost of any special
security services required for subsequent responses to the scene within the
next 12 months.
   (B)   Only one warning will be given pursuant to this section before the
city assesses special security service costs pursuant to §
6.80.050. If a responsible person cannot be identified at the scene, the Police
Department may issue a warning to one of the other responsible persons defined
in §
6.80.030 or subsequently return to the scene and issue the warning to a then-
present responsible person. Warnings given to responsible persons who do not
reside at the premises in question shall be delivered by certified mail.
(Ord. 12-06, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 6.80.050 Cost recovery for special security services.
   When the Police Department or Fire Department or other city emergency
responder responds to a loud or unruly gathering at premises with a given
address in the city within 12 months of a warning given to a responsible person
for those premises pursuant to §
6.80.040, or while any such warning remains in effect pursuant to §
6.80.040, all responsible persons shall be jointly and severally liable for the
city’s costs of providing special security service for that response and all
subsequent responses during that warning period.
(Ord. 12-06, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 6.80.060 Violations; fines.
   (A)   Violations. It shall be an infraction for a responsible person to
conduct or allow a loud or unruly gathering on premises owned by the

subsequent violation within a 12-month period shall constitute a misdemeanor.
   (B)   Fines. The City Council, by resolution, shall establish civil

any other special security service charges that may be assessed pursuant to
this Chapter 6.80.
   (D)   Application of subsequent fines. The second, third or subsequent
violation fines prescribed at division (B) above are payable whether or not the
responsible person at the time of the current loud or unruly gathering is the
same person who was the responsible person for any prior loud or unruly
gathering at those premises.
   (E)   Warning period. The fine schedule prescribed at division (B) above is
a “rolling schedule” meaning that in calculating the fine payable the Police
Department or City Attorney shall count backward starting from the date of the
most recent loud or unruly gathering to determine how many prior loud or unruly
gatherings have taken place at the premises in question during the statutory
12-month period. A warning given pursuant to §
6.80.040 shall remain in effect for the premises at a given address until a
full 12-month period has elapsed during which there have been no loud or unruly

computed and a bill submitted to the responsible person(s). The Chief of Police
shall promulgate notice and billing procedures for this purpose.
   (B)   The emergency response costs incurred under this section shall be
deemed a debt owed to the city and are due 30 days after receipt of the bill. A
bill will be deemed received five days after the date posted on the bill which
is mailed by placing first class postage on the envelope and mailing it to the

such costs;

      (3)   The date and time of the emergency response;
      (4)   The names of law enforcement, fire or emergency service providers
who responded;

ordinance, the Engineer shall determine which benefit districts which existed
prior to this ordinance are still active. The City Engineer shall then
determine what unpaid balance exists in each active benefit district, together

district and apply the same procedures for repayment as outlined in division
(C) to said unpaid balance except that the 20-year time limit mentioned in that
section shall be from the original date of the adoption of said district.
   (F)   Interest. The unpaid balance due the applicant for water main shall be
adjusted by annual compounding with a variable interest rate. The interest rate
used for each calendar year shall be based on the average annual Local Agency
Investment Fund (LAIF) rate of return on City of Tulare investments from the
previous calendar year.

§ 7.17.010 Purpose and findings.
   The City of Tulare finds and declares:
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to implement state laws in order to
reduce the amount of recyclable, e.g., non-organic and organic, solid wastes
deposited in landfills from the city's commercial businesses, residents, and
self-haulers.
   (B)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 939 of 1989, the Cal. Integrated
Waste Management Act of 1989 (Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 40000 et seq., as
amended, supplemented, superseded, and replaced from time to time), requires
cities and counties to reduce, reuse, and recycle (including composting) solid
waste generated in their jurisdictions to the maximum extent feasible before
any incineration or landfill disposal of waste, to conserve water, energy, and
other natural resources, and to protect the environment.
   (C)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 341 of 2011 (approved by the
Governor of the state of California on October 5, 2011, which amended §§ 41730,
41731, 41734, 41735, 41736, 41800, 42926, 44004, and 50001 of, and added §§
40004, 41734.5, and 41780.01 and Chapter 12.8 (commencing with § 42649) to Part
3 of Division 30 of, and added and repealed § 41780.02 of, Cal. Public
Resources Code as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced from time to
time), places requirements on businesses and multifamily property owners that
generate a specified threshold amount of solid waste to arrange for recycling
services and requires jurisdictions to implement a mandatory commercial
recycling program.
   (D)   State organics recycling law, Assembly Bill 1826 of 2014 (approved by
the Governor of the State of California on September 28, 2014, which added
Chapter 12.9 (commencing with § 42649.8) to Part 3 of Division 30 of the Cal.
Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste, as amended, supplemented,
superseded, and replaced from time to time), requires businesses and
multifamily property owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid
waste, recycling, and organic waste per week to arrange for recycling services
for that waste, requires jurisdictions to implement a recycling program to
divert organic waste from businesses subject to the law, and requires
jurisdictions to implement a mandatory commercial organics recycling program.
   (E)   SB 1383, the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires CalRecycle to develop regulations to reduce organics in landfills as a
source of methane. The regulations place requirements on multiple entities
including jurisdictions, residential households, commercial businesses and
business owners, commercial edible food generators, haulers, self-haulers, food
recovery organizations, and food recovery services to support achievement of
statewide organic waste disposal reduction targets.
   (F)   SB 1383, the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires jurisdictions to adopt and enforce an ordinance or enforceable
mechanism to implement relevant provisions of SB 1383 regulations. This chapter
will also help reduce food insecurity by requiring commercial edible food
generators to arrange to have the maximum amount of their edible food, that
would otherwise be disposed, be recovered for human consumption.
   (G)   Requirements in this chapter are consistent with other adopted goals
and policies of the city to reduce waste and lower emissions of greenhouse
gases.
   (H)   This chapter is intended to supplement the city's general regulation
of solid waste set forth in other portions of the City's Municipal Code,
including, but not limited to,
Chapter 7.16.

environment by minimizing public exposure to unsanitary conditions. By
controlling the discharge of fats, oils and grease to the wastewater collection
system, excessive buildup in sewer lines can be lessened, thereby increasing
the system’s operating efficiency and reducing the number of sewer line
blockages and overflows.
   (C)   General FOG discharge prohibitions. No food service establishment
(FSE) shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the sewer system FOG that
may accumulate and/or cause or contribute to blockages in the sewer system or
at the sewer lateral which connects the FSE to the sewer system.
   (D)   Specific FOG prohibitions. The following specific prohibitions shall
apply to all FSEs:
      (1)   Discharge of any FOG-containing wastewater that is not connected to
a grease removal device is prohibited.
      (2)   Non-grease laden sources such as, but not limited to, hand-wash
sinks, toilets, urinals, and stormwater, shall not be connected to a grease
removal device.
      (3)   No dishwasher shall be connected to a grease trap.
      (4)   Discharge of wastewater with temperatures in excess of 140°F (60°C)
into any grease trap is prohibited.
      (5)   Direct disposal of any waste cooking oil into any drain or cleanout
that is connected to the sewer system is prohibited.
      (6)   Introduction of any additive into a grease removal device or
directly into the sewer system for the purpose of emulsifying FOG,
biologically/chemically treating FOG for grease remediation, or as a supplement
to any grease removal device maintenance is prohibited, unless specifically
authorized in writing by the General Manager.
      (7)   Discharge of any waste which has been removed from a grease removal
device into the sewer system is prohibited.
   (E)   FOG wastewater discharge permit required. All FSEs shall obtain a FOG
wastewater discharge permit. Nothing in the permit is intended to relieve the
FSE of any local, state, or federal regulation. Any denial of a permit may be
appealed under §
7.20.900.
   (F)   Permit application requirements. FOG wastewater discharge permit
applications shall include the following information:

to minimize the discharge of FOG to the sewer system, including, but not
limited to, the following, as applicable:
      (1)   Installation of drain screens. Drain screens shall be installed on
all drainage pipes in food preparation areas.
      (2)   Segregation and collection of waste cooking oil. All waste cooking
oil shall be collected and stored properly in recycling receptacles such as
barrels or drums. Such recycling receptacles shall be maintained properly to
insure that they do not leak. Licensed waste haulers or an approved recycling
facility must be used to dispose of waste cooking oil.
      (3)   Disposal of food waste. All food waste should be disposed of
directly into the trash or garbage and not into sinks and shall be disposed of
in a manner that will ensure against leakage in the trash container or anywhere
else.
      (4)   Employee training. Employees of the FSE shall be trained by
ownership/management periodically as specified in the FOG wastewater discharge
permit on the following subjects:
         (a)   Dry-wiping pots, pans, dishware and work areas before washing to
remove grease.
         (b)   Properly disposing food waste and solids in plastic bags prior
to disposal in trash bins or containers to prevent leaking and odors.
         (c)   The location and use of absorption products to clean under fryer
baskets and other locations where grease may be spilled or dripped.
         (d)   Properly disposing grease or oils from cooking equipment into a
proper grease receptacle without spilling.

disposed of properly.
      (6)   Kitchen signage. Best management and waste minimization practices
shall be posted conspicuously in the food preparation and dishwashing areas at
all times.
   (J)   FOG pretreatment required for new and existing FSEs. FSEs are required
to install, operate, and maintain an approved type and adequately sized grease
interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with the objectives of this
section, subject only to the variance and waiver provisions and other
exceptions of this section. The grease interceptor shall be adequate to
separate and remove FOG contained in wastewater discharges from FSEs prior to
discharge to the sewer system. Fixtures, equipment, and drain lines located in
the food preparation and cleanup areas of FSEs that are sources of FOG
discharges shall be connected to the grease interceptor.
      (1)   New FSEs shall include and install grease interceptors prior to
commencing discharges of wastewater to the sewer system.
      (2)   Existing FSEs shall install grease interceptors in any of the
following circumstances:
         (a)   When the FSE changes ownership;
         (b)   When any change in operation results in or has the potential to
result in the increase of the amount of FOG generated and/or discharged by FSE
in an amount that alone or collectively causes or creates a potential SSO to
occur;
         (c)   When it is determined by the General Manager that the FSE caused
or contributed to grease-related blockages in the sewer system, has sewer
laterals connected to hot spots, or has been determined to contribute
significant FOG to the sewer system, based on inspection and sampling;
         (d)   During a remodel; or
         (e)   Any other time the General Manager reasonably determines that
installation of a grease interceptor is necessary to avoid an adverse impact to
the sewer system.
      (3)   Any existing FSE that receives a notice from the General Manager to
install a grease interceptor must install the interceptor within 180 days
unless otherwise required by the General Manager.
   (K)   Variance of grease interceptor requirement. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this section, an existing FSE may obtain a variance, at the
General Manager’s discretion, from the grease interceptor requirement to allow
alternative pretreatment technology that is equally effective in controlling
the FOG discharge in lieu of a grease interceptor. One such type of alternative
pretreatment technology is a grease trap. Consideration of granting the
variance will be based on the following:
      (1)   There is insufficient space for installation and/or maintenance of
a grease interceptor.
      (2)   There is inadequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing
fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and
the private collection line or the public sewer.
      (3)   The FSE can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the General
Manager, that the alternative pretreatment technology is equivalent or better
than a grease interceptor in controlling FOG. In addition, the FSE must be able
to demonstrate, after installation of the proposed alternative pretreatment
technology, its continued ability to effectively control FOG discharge.
      (4)   The variance may be rescinded if subsequent monitoring shows
accumulation of FOG in the sewer lateral or the collection system downstream of
the FSEs connection or if the FSE caused or contributed to a sanitary sewer
overflow. A grease interceptor must be installed within 180 days of the
rescission of a variance. Denial or revocation of a variance may be appealed
pursuant to § 7.20.900.
   (L)   Cost recovery. All costs incurred for cleaning the sewer line to
remove FOG buildup caused or contributed to by an FSE shall be reimbursed to
the city by the FSE. Factors for determining responsible parties for cost
recovery charges include the FSEs that are discharging into the affected sewer
line, the presence of grease removal devices or alternative pretreatment in the
FSE, proper maintenance of grease removal devices by the FSE, implementation of
BMPs, and any waivers or variances granted.
   (M)   Drawing submittal requirements. At the time of obtaining a FOG
wastewater discharge permit or upon request by the General Manager:
      (1)   FSEs may be required to submit copies of design and as-built
facility site plans, mechanical and plumbing plans and details to show all
sewer locations and connections. The documents shall be in a form acceptable to
the General Manager for review of existing grease control devices, monitoring
facilities, metering facilities and operating procedures. The review of plans
and procedures shall in no way relieve the FSE of the responsibility to modify
the facilities or procedures in the future, as necessary to produce an
acceptable discharge and to meet the requirements of this FOG control program.
      (2)   FSEs may be required to submit a schematic drawing of the grease
removal device or alternative pretreatment, piping and instrumentation diagram,
and wastewater characterization report.
      (3)   At the General Manager’s discretion, all drawings and/or reports
may be required to be prepared by a California registered civil, chemical, or
electrical engineer.
   (N)   Grease interceptor requirements. Any FSE that is required to provide
FOG pretreatment shall install, operate and maintain an approved type and
properly sized grease interceptor, or other grease removal device authorized
under an approved variance, necessary to maintain compliance with the purpose
of the FOG control program.
      (1)   Approved grease interceptor sizing and installation shall conform
to the latest approved edition of the California Uniform Plumbing Code.
      (2)   Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the
design approved by the General Manager and shall have a minimum of two
compartments with fittings designed for grease retention.
      (3)   Grease interceptors shall be installed at a location where it shall
be at all times easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of
accumulated grease.
         (a)   Grease interceptors may not be installed in any part of the
building where food is handled.

all contents of the devices including wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating
materials, sludge and solids.
      (1)   No FOG that has accumulated in a grease interceptor shall be
allowed to pass into any sewer lateral, sewer system, storm drain, or public
right-of-way during maintenance activities.
      (2)   FSEs that are located in an area that is considered to be a hot
spot will be required to submit data and information necessary to establish a
maintenance frequency for their grease interceptor.
      (3)   The maintenance frequency for all FSEs with a grease interceptor
shall be determined in one of the following methods:
         (a)   Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned at a
frequency such that the combined FOG and solids accumulation does not exceed
the 25% rule. Regardless, the interval between cleaning shall not exceed three
months.
         (b)   The owner/operator of a FSE may submit a request to the General
Manager asking for a change in the maintenance frequency at any time. The FSE
has the burden of responsibility to prove that the change reflects actual
operating conditions based on the average FOG accumulation over time, and meets
the requirements of the 25% rule. The FSE must also show that it is in full
compliance with the conditions of its FOG wastewater discharge permit and this
section. Upon approval by the General Manager, the FOG wastewater discharge
permit will be modified accordingly to reflect the change in maintenance
frequency.
         (c)   If the grease interceptor contains, at any time, FOG and solids
accumulation that exceeds the 25% rule, the FSE shall be required to have the
grease interceptor serviced immediately so that all FOG, sludge and other

§ 7.20.520 Reporting requirements for industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment.
   (A)   Baseline monitoring reports. Within 180 days after the effective date
of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final
administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to
the categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be required to submit to the General
Manager a report which contains the information listed in divisions (A)(1)
through (A)(7) of this section. If reports containing this information already
have been submitted to the RWQCB or the Regional Administrator in compliance
with the requirement of 40 C.F.R. § 128.140(b), the industrial user shall not
be required to submit this information again. However, the industrial user
shall provide the General Manager with a copy of the report along with written
verification from the RWQCB that the report items have been received by the
RWQCB. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources and
sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the city a
report which contains the information listed in divisions (A)(1) through (A)(5)
of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report
information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the
information requested in divisions (A)(4) and (A)(5) of this section.
      (1)   Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address
of the facility including the name of the operator and owners;
      (2)   Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control
permits held by or for the facility;
      (3)   Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief
description of the nature, average rate of production and standard industrial
classification of the operation(s) carried out by the industrial user. This
description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points
of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes;
      (4)   Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW
from each of the following:
         (a)   Regulated process streams; and
         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e). (See division (A)(5) of this section.)
The General Manager may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where
justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
      (5)   Measurement of pollutants.
         (a)   The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to
each regulated process.
         (b)   In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and
analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by
the standard or General Manager) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from
each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass,
where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best
management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the General Manager or the applicable standards to
determine compliance with the standard.
         (c)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this division.
         (d)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of
40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with the
supporting data shall be submitted to the General Manager.
         (e)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40
C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the Regional Administrator determines that the
40 C.F.R. part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using
validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical
procedures, including procedures suggested by the General Manager or other
parties, approved by the Regional Administrator.
         (f)   The General Manager may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures.
         (g)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that the sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
      (6)   Certification. The user shall submit a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a
qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met
on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and

industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (7)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the user shall submit the
shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional
pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard.
         (a)   Where the industrial user’s categorical pretreatment standard
has been modified by a removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined
waste stream formula (40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different
factors variance (40 C.F.R. § 403.13) at the time the user submits the report
required by division (B) of this section, the information required by divisions
(A)(6) and (A)(7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits.
         (b)   If the categorical pretreatment standards are modified by a
removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40
C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40
C.F.R. § 403.13) after the user submits the report required by this division
(A), any necessary amendment to the information requested by divisions (A)(6)
and (A)(7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the General
Manager within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.
      (8)   Signature. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with §
7.20.510 of this chapter.
   (B)   Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards.
The following conditions apply to the compliance schedule required by §
7.20.520(A)(7) of this chapter.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation, and the like).
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months.

final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report
to the General Manager including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with
the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which
it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and
the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the
schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between
the progress reports to the General Manager.
   (C)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
      (1)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the General Manager a report containing the information described in
divisions (A)(4) through (A)(6) of this section.
      (2)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration

with §
7.20.510 of this chapter.
   (D)   Periodic reports on continued compliance.
      (1)   Except as specified in division (D)(3) of this section, any
industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the
compliance date of the pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the General
Manager during the months of June and December of each year, unless required
more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the General Manager or the
approval authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment
standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the
discharge reported in division (A)(4) of this section, except that the General
Manager may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (or
pollution prevention alternative), the user shall submit documentation required
by the General Manager or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the
compliance status of the user. At the discretion of the General Manager and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, and the like, the General Manager may agree to alter the months during
which above reports are to be submitted.
      (2)   The General Manager may authorize the industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the
following conditions:
         (a)   The General Manager may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the
facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an
applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process water.
         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control
mechanism, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new
request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent
control mechanism.
         (c)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes. The request for a
monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with paragraph (1) of this
section, and include the certification statement in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(2)
(ii). Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a
pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 C.F.R. part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
         (d)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the General Manager must
be included as a condition in the user’s control mechanism. The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request
for the waiver must be maintained by the General Manager for three years after
expiration of the waiver.
         (e)   Upon arrival of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s
control mechanism by the General Manager, the industrial user must certify on
each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user:
      “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR [specify the
applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best
of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list
pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since
filling of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1).”
         (f)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or
is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the user’s operations,
the user must immediately: comply with the monitoring requirements of division
(D)(1) of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed
by the General Manager, and notify the General Manager.
         (g)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      (3)   The General Manager may reduce the requirement in division (D)(1)
of this section to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year,
unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the approval
authority, where the industrial user meets all of the following conditions:
         (a)   The industrial user’s total categorical wastewater flow does not
exceed any of the following:
            1.   One one-hundredth percent (0.01%) of the design dry weather
hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller,
as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the
industrial user discharges in batches;
            2.   One one-hundredth percent (0.01%) of the design dry weather
organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and
            3.   One one-hundredth percent (0.01%) of the maximum allowable
headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were developed by a POTW
in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(c) and division (C) of this section.
         (b)   The industrial user has not been in significant noncompliance,
as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)(2)(viii), for any time in the past two
years;
         (c)   The industrial user does not have daily flow rates, production
levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the
reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are
not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant
to §
7.20.630;
         (d)   The industrial user must notify the General Manager immediately
of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of
divisions (D)(3)(a) or (D)(3)(b) of this section. Upon notification, the
industrial user must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in
division (D)(1) of this section; and
         (e)   The General Manager must retain documentation to support the
General Manager’s determination that a specific industrial user qualifies for
reduced reporting requirements under division (D)(3) of this section for a
period of three years after the expiration of the term of the control
mechanism.
      (4)   Where the General Manager has imposed mass limitations on
industrial users as provided for by 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(d), the report required
by division (D)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by pretreatment standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
      (5)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the city in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c), the
report required by division (D)(1) shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user’s long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the
report required by division (D)(1) shall include the user’s actual average
production rate for the reporting period.
      (6)   All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with §
7.20.510 of this chapter.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.480) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.530 Reporting requirements for significant industrial users not subject
to categorical pretreatment standards.
   The General Manager must require appropriate reporting from those
significant industrial users with discharges that are not subject to
categorical pretreatment standards. Significant noncategorical industrial users
must submit to the General Manager at least once every six months (on dates
specified by the General Manager) a description of the nature, concentration,
and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the General Manager. In
cases where a local limit requires compliance with a best management practice
or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation
required by the General Manager to determine the compliance status of the user.
These reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period
covered by the report, and in accordance with the techniques described in 40
C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or
where the Regional Administrator determines that the 40 C.F.R. part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures
suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the Regional Administrator.
This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of the
significant noncategorical industrial user.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.484) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.540 Notification of violation— Resampling requirements.
   (A)   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall
notify the General Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
   (B)   The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the General Manager within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. Where the General Manager has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the General Manager must
perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the
violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is
not required if:
      (1)   The General Manager performs sampling at the industrial user’s
facility at a frequency of at least once per month; or
      (2)   The General Manager performs sampling at the industrial user’s
facility between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time
when the user or the General Manager receives the results of this sampling.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.486) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.550 Notification of potential problems, including slug discharge.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, a slug discharge or a slug load which may cause potential problems
or damage to the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge
standards or specific limitations in this chapter), it is the responsibility of
all users to telephone and notify the General Manager within 24 hours of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the
industrial user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall,
unless waived by the General Manager, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. The notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall the notification relieve the
industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be
imposed by this chapter.
   (C)   Failure to notify the General Manager of potential problem discharges
shall be deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
   (D)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user’s bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of
a discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
   (E)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the General
Manager immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for
a slug discharge.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.488) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.560 Notification of changes.
   Each user must notify the General Manager of any planned significant changes
to the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. The user may be
required to submit the information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the
changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application. The General Manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit
application or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to
the changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.490) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.570 Notification of discharge of hazardous wastes.
   (A)   Every user shall notify the General Manager, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261, or Cal. Code of
Regulations Title 22. The notification must include the name of the hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user
discharges more than ten kilograms of the waste per calendar month to the POTW,
the notification shall also contain the following information:
      (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
      (2)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of the constituents in
the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and
      (3)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
   (B)   All notifications must take place within ten days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges
must be submitted under §
7.20.560. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of this
chapter.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user shall notify the General
Manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of the substances within 30 days
of the effective date of the regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has been
determined to be economically practical.

2015)
§ 7.20.580 Compliance schedules.
   Any industrial user not in compliance with this chapter or any discharge
limitations shall abide by the provisions of a compliance schedule developed by
the General Manager. The General Manager may require:
   (A)   The development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for
the installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements; and
   (B)   The submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from
industrial users as are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial
users with pretreatment standards and requirements, including but not limited
to the reports required in §
7.20.520.

§ 7.20.590 Record keeping.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of the requirements and documentation
associated with best management practices established under §
7.20.520(A)(5)(b). Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time
of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques
or methods used; and the results of the analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the General Manager.

2015)
§ 7.20.600 Pretreatment facilities.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in this chapter within the
time limitations specified by EPA, the state or the General Manager, whichever
is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the General Manager
for review, and shall be acceptable to the General Manager before the
facilities are constructed. The review of the plans and operating procedures
shall, in no way, relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under
provisions of this chapter.

2015)
§ 7.20.610 Additional pretreatment measures.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the General Manager may require industrial
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate domestic waste streams from
industrial waste streams and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and determine the industrial user’s compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The General Manager may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.520) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.620 Control manholes.
   When required by the General Manager, the owner of any property served by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. The manhole, when required, shall be accessible and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with the plans approved
by the General Manager, and the manhole shall be installed by the owner at his
or her expense and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and
accessible to the city at all times.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.530) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.630 Sewage sampling, analysis and flow measurement.
   (A)   Except in the case of non-significant categorical users, the reports
required in §
7.20.520(A), (B), (C), and §
7.20.530 of this chapter shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of
the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested by the General Manager, of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.
This sampling and analysis may be performed by the General Manager in lieu of
the industrial user. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis
in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to submit the
compliance certification required in this section. In addition, where the POTW
itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow
data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
   (B)   The reports required in §
7.20.520(A), (B), (C), and §
7.20.530 of this chapter must be based upon data obtained through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which
data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
The General Manager shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to
assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the General Manager. Where time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the General
Manager, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision
to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user
file for the facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the General
Manager, as appropriate.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §
7.20.520, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the General Manager may authorize a
lower minimum. For the periodic reports on continued compliance and the reports
required in §
7.20.520, the General Manager shall require the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (D)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in
periodic reports on continued compliance, monitors any regulated pollutant at
the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the General
Manager, using the procedures prescribed in division (A)(5)(e) of this section,
the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (E)   The General Manager may use a grab sample(s) to determine
noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
   (F)   All samples for laboratory analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes determined in accordance with 40 C.F.R. part 136, as described in §§
7.20.520 and
7.20.530, shall be collected at the control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.
   (G)   The General Manager shall have reasonable access onto the industrial
user’s property to collect samples and perform tests, as defined in §
7.20.040.
   (H)   Periodic measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, BOD and suspended
solids for use in determining the monthly industrial wastewater treatment
service charge and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary
by the General Manager shall be made by all industrial users, unless
specifically relieved of the obligation by the General Manager.
   (I)   All such sampling, analyses and flow measurements of industrial
wastewaters shall be performed by a state-certified independent laboratory, by
a laboratory operated by an industrial user and approved by the General Manager
or by personnel of the city. Prior to submittal to the General Manager of data
developed in the laboratory of an industrial user, the results shall be
verified by a responsible administrative official of the industrial user under
the penalty of perjury.
   (J)   All users making periodic measurements shall furnish and install at
the control manholes or other appropriate location a calibrated flume, weir,
flow meter or similar device approved by the General Manager and suitable to
measure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A flow
indicating, recording and totalizing register may be required by the General
Manager. In lieu of wastewater flow measurement, the General Manager may accept
records of water usage and adjust the flow volumes by suitable factors to
determine peak and average flow rates for the specific industrial wastewater
discharge.
   (K)   The minimum requirement for self- monitoring shall be at least two
times per year for significant industrial users, whether or not they are
subject to national categorical standards.
   (L)   Industrial users with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of
wastewater may be required to provide continuous sampling and analyses for
every day of operation. When required by the General Manager, users shall
install and maintain automatic flow proportional sampling equipment and/or
automatic analysis and recording equipment, approved by the General Manager.

2015)
§ 7.20.640 Federal categorical pretreatment standards.
   The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 C.F.R. Ch. I,
Subch. N, parts 405–471, as amended, are hereby incorporated.
   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
General Manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with division (C) of this section.
   (B)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the General Manager
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (C)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that
the General Manager convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The
determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the
discretion of the General Manager. The General Manager may establish equivalent
mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions in
divisions (C)(1)(a) through (C)(1)(e) of this section.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user’s request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify
the General Manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than
20% from its baseline production rates determined in division (C)(1)(c) of this
section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the General Manager
will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division (C)(1)(a) of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   A General Manager which chooses to establish equivalent mass
limits:
         (a)   Must calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control
mechanism terms if the industrial user’s actual average daily flow rate was
reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods
and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original
calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution
as a substitute for treatment pursuant to § 7.20.650. The industrial user must
also be in compliance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.17 (regarding the prohibition of
bypass).
      (4)   The General Manager may not express limits in terms of mass for
pollutants such as pH, temperature, radiation, or other pollutants which cannot
appropriately be expressed as mass.
   (D)   The General Manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards at 40 C.F.R. parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users under the following conditions. When converting such limits to
concentration limits, the General Manager must use the concentrations listed in
the applicable subparts of 40 C.F.R. parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that
dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by §
7.20.650.
   (E)   Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with divisions (C),
(D), (E), and (F) of this section are deemed pretreatment standards for the
purposes of § 307(d) of the Act and this part. The General Manager must
document how the equivalent limits were derived and make this information
publicly available. Once incorporated into its control mechanism, the
industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the
promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived.
   (F)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
   (G)   Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based
standard shall notify the General Manager within two business days after the
user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the
General Manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its control mechanism that were based on the original
estimate of the long term average production rate.
   (H)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the General Manager
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(e).
   (I)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive portions of
40 C.F.R. § 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.
   (J)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.15.

§ 7.20.650 Dilution prohibited.
   No industrial user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The General
Manager may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using
dilution to meet applicable standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

§ 7.20.660 Salinity control plan.
   (A)   Any discharger using bulk salt (greater than 100 pounds per day) for
product preparation and/or ancillary plant operations (such as water softeners
for boilers) or other chemicals that contribute salinity to the discharge,
shall implement and submit to the General Manager a salinity control plan by
the effective date of this chapter. The salinity control plan shall use best
management practices to reduce the electrical conductivity discharges below the
maximum concentration limitation provided in §
7.20.480. The salinity control plan shall contain the following items, at a
minimum:
      (1)   Determinations or best estimates of the identities and approximate
quantities of salts used and discharged;
      (2)   Descriptions of the major salting operations and locations of
potential salt release points on site drawing;
      (3)   A spill prevention, control and countermeasures (SPCC) plan;
      (4)   A description of the methods of salt waste removal and disposal;
      (5)   A description of the employee training program for salinity
control; and
      (6)   Identification of the person responsible for implementation of the
salinity control plan.
   (B)   The salinity control plan shall be implemented and submitted to the
General Manager by the effective date of this chapter and endorsed by industry
officials.
   (C)   The salinity control plan shall be updated by the discharger during
renewal of the wastewater discharge permit.
   (D)   In the case of any accidental slug or batch discharge of salt wastes
that causes the discharger’s wastewater electrical conductivity to exceed the
maximum concentration limitation provided in §
7.20.480, the discharger shall immediately notify the General Manager days of
such discharge and submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the discharger to prevent similar
future occurrences.

§ 7.20.670 Accidental discharge—Slug control plan.
   The General Manager shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to
control slug discharges. The General Manager may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that
may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the General Manager
may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
   (A)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
   (B)   Description of stored chemicals;
   (C)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge, as required by §
7.20.550 of this chapter; and including any discharge that would violate a
prohibition under 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(b) with procedures for follow-up written
notification within five days; and
   (D)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

§ 7.20.690 Hauled wastewater.
   (A)   Septic tank waste, grease, oil and sand interceptor waste may be
accepted into the POTW at a designated receiving structure within the treatment
plant area, and at such times as are established by the General Manager,
provided such wastes do not violate this chapter or any other requirements
established or adopted by the city. Wastewater discharge permits for individual
vehicles to use the facilities shall be issued by the General Manager.
   (B)   The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as “industrial septage”
requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from the General
Manager. The General Manager shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of
such wastes, if such disposal would interfere with the treatment plant
operation. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other
sections of this chapter.
   (C)   All hauled wastes shall be identified by the type of discharge, volume
of discharge, source address and owner before being allowed to discharge. The
General Manager may require random or routine testing of these dischargers.
   (D)   Fees for dumping hauled wastes will be established as part of the
industrial user fee system as authorized by resolution of the Board of Public
Utilities.
   (E)   Wastewater discharge permits issued to haulers subject to this section
shall contain requirements for maintaining proper records and manifests, and
any other information as described in §
7.20.660.

§ 7.20.700 Wastewater survey.
   (A)   The General Manager is authorized to identify and locate all possible
industrial users which might be subject to the POTW pretreatment program. Any
compilation, index or inventory of industrial users made under this section
shall be made available to the approval authority of Regional Administrator
upon request.
   (B)   When requested by the General Manager all industrial users must submit
information on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater by completing
a wastewater survey prior to commencing their discharge. The General Manager is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require
industrial users to update the survey. Failure to complete this survey shall be
reasonable grounds for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be
considered a violation of this chapter.
   (C)   The General Manager shall notify industrial users identified under
division (A) of this section of applicable local, state or federal pretreatment
standards and any applicable requirements under §§ 204(b) and 405 of the Act
and divisions (C) and (D) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or any
other requirements of local, state or federal law. Within 30 days of the list
approval pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)(6) of a list of SIUs, the General
Manager shall notify each SIU of its status and all requirements applicable to
it as a result of the status.

   The General Manager shall have the authority to deny or condition new or
increased contributions of pollutants or changes in the nature of pollutants to
the POTW by industrial users where the contributions do not meet applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements or where the contributions would cause
the city to violate its waste discharge requirements.
   (A)   Any industrial user which discharges industrial waste into the POTW
prior to the effective date hereof and who wishes to continue the discharges in
the future, shall, within 90 days after the date, apply to the General Manager
for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with this chapter, and shall
not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 180 days of the
effective date hereof except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit
issued by the General Manager.
   (B)   Any industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging
industrial wastes into the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior
to the beginning or recommencing of the discharge. An application for this
wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least 90 days prior to the date
upon which any discharge will begin.
   (C)   Any existing industrial user located beyond the city limits and which
utilizes the city’s public sewer system to discharge industrial waste shall
submit a wastewater discharge permit application, in accordance with this
chapter, within 90 days of the effective date hereof. New industrial users
located beyond the city shall submit the applications to the General Manager 90
days prior to any proposed discharge into the system.

§ 7.20.830 Violation—Penalty.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision of this
chapter. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, any violation of the
provisions herein shall constitute a misdemeanor. Notwithstanding the

action is commenced to enforce the provisions of the chapter, the trial court,
upon recommendation of the City Attorney, may reduce the charged offense from a
misdemeanor to an infraction.
   (B)   Any person convicted on a misdemeanor under this chapter shall be
punished by a fine not to exceed $2,500 or by imprisonment not exceeding six
months, or by both the fine and imprisonment.
   (C)   Any person convicted of an infraction under this chapter shall be
punished by:
      (1)   A fine not exceeding $50 for a first violation;
      (2)   A fine not exceeding $100 for a second violation of this chapter
within one year; and
      (3)   A fine not exceeding $250 for each and every additional violation
of this chapter within one year.
   (D)   Each day that a violation continues shall be regarded as a new and
separate offense.
   (E)   In addition to the penalty set forth hereinabove for the conviction of
a misdemeanor and/or infraction for violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter, any person so convicted shall further be required to pay restitution
to the city for all costs, including city staff time and reasonable attorney’s
fees, related to the enforcement of this chapter.

§ 7.20.840 Notification of violation.
   Whenever the General Manager finds that any user has violated or is
violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the General Manager may serve
upon the user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the General Manager. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.720) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.850 Consent order.
   The General Manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. The orders will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this chapter
and shall be judicially enforceable.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.730) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-

§ 7.20.860 Show cause hearing.
   The General Manager may order any user which causes or contributes to
violations of this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or orders issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the General Manager and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for
the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and a
request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
certified mail at least 15 days prior to the hearing. The notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears
as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing
date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other
action against the user.

§ 7.20.870 Compliance order.
   When the General Manager finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate this chapter, wastewater discharge permit or orders issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he or she may issue an order
to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time frame. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service shall be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-
monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.750) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.880 Cease and desist order.
   When the General Manager finds that a user is violating this chapter, the
user’s wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are
likely to recur, the General Manager may issue an order to the user directing
it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to
immediately comply with all requirements and take such appropriate remedial or
preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or
threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the
discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to
taking any other action against the user.

§ 7.20.890 Administrative fines.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user that is
found to have violated any provision of this chapter, its wastewater discharge
permit, and orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be fined in any amount not to exceed $1,000 per incident. The
fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Assessments may be added to the user’s next scheduled sewer service
charge and the General Manager shall have such other collection remedies as may
be available for other service charges and fees.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request with
the General Manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit,
the General Manager shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of
receiving the request from the industrial user. In the event the user’s appeal
is successful, the payment together with any interest accruing thereto shall be
returned to the industrial user. The city may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 7.20.900 Appeals.
   Any person affected by any decision, action or determination by the General
Manager, interpreting or implementing the provisions of this chapter,
including, without limitations, the provisions of this chapter, or any
industrial wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder by the General Manager,
excepting therefrom any decision, action or determination of the General
Manager to pursue either criminal penalties or civil judicial enforcement, may
file with the City Clerk, within ten days of the date of service of the
decision, action or determination, a notice of appeal to the Board of Public
Utilities appealing the decision, action or determination by the General
Manager. The notice of appeal shall set forth in detail all facts supporting
the industrial user’s appeal of the decision of the General Manager. The filing
of the notice of appeal shall stay all further action required under any notice
of violation or cease and desist orders and accumulation of interest upon
penalties thereon, pending final decision by the Board of Public Utilities on
the appeal; provided, however, that nothing stated herein shall limit the
authority of the General Manager to take the action or to make the directives
as the General Manager deems necessary to stop or prevent an ongoing or
threatened violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, including
actions or directives to prevent or stop threatened damage to the system, pass
through, or threatened harm to the health or safety of the public. The action
shall include, without limitation, continuing to physically block the
industrial user’s access to the sewer until the appeal is heard and decided by
the Board of Public Utilities.

§ 7.20.910 Emergency suspensions.
   The General Manager may immediately suspend a user’s discharge permit
whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or which
threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may
present an endangerment to the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
General Manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
or endangerment to any individuals. The General Manager shall allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the General Manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings set forth in this chapter are initiated against the
user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment, shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the General Manager, prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under this chapter. Nothing in this section
shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension
under this section.

orders issued hereunder, is subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; and
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in this chapter or
resolution of the Board of Public Utilities.

§ 7.20.930 Injunctive relief.
   Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, wastewater discharge
permit or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the
General Manager may petition the Superior Court of the State of California
through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the industrial user. Such other action as appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the city. A petition
for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other
action against a user.

other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day
during the period of the violation.
   (B)   The General Manager may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice
requires.

2015)
§ 7.20.1100 Benefit district procedures.
   When the General Manager finds that it is necessary to install a sewer main
or when a sewer main was previously installed and paid for by the city, he or
she shall delineate the area which may be served from the main and thereby be
benefitted as provided in §
8.60.020.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.970) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.1110 Benefit district refunding.
   (A)   If the applicant elects to install the required sewer main under
benefit district procedures and does install the sewer main in accordance with
regulations concerning main extensions, the General Manager shall establish and
administer reimbursement procedures as follows: The General Manager shall
establish a frontage fee for the cost of an eight-inch main and shall prepare a
benefit district refunding agreement to be executed by the applicant and the
president of the Board of Public Utilities Commissioners in accordance with the
provisions of Title 8,
Chapter 8.60 of this code. The difference in cost between an actual main larger
than eight inches and an eight-inch main shall be reimbursed in accordance with
the provisions of Title 8,
Chapter 8.64 of this code. The cost per foot “C” shall be calculated by
dividing the total cost of the eight-inch main by the total footage of the main
installed. Whenever costs are referred to in this section, they shall be
limited to the costs as specified in §
8.60.030. The frontage fee shall be calculated as “A” in the following formula:
         A = F x C x .60 wherein
      F = the number of feet of an applicant’s property fronting on the main
      C = cost per foot of installing an eight-inch main
      .60 = factor composed of .50 (for one of the two sides fronting on the
main) and .10 (for the street intersection allowance)
   (B)   Provided, however, when the General Manager determines that only one
side of a street can be benefitted by a main installed by a previous applicant,
the frontage fee shall be calculated as “A” in the following formula:
         A = F x C x 1.10 wherein
      F = the number of feet of an applicant’s property fronting on the main
      C = cost per foot of installing an eight-inch main
      1.10 = a factor composed of 1.00 (the total cost of the eight-inch
installation) and .10 (for street intersection allowance)
   (C)   Amounts collected as provided herein shall be paid by the city to the
applicant who paid the cost of installing the main, until the applicant has
received an amount equal to “R” as calculated in the following formula:
         R = T - (.60 x C x F) - Z wherein
      T = total cost of installing eight-inch main and laterals
      C = cost per foot of installing eight-inch main
      F = number of feet of installing applicant’s property fronting on main
      Z = installing applicant’s lateral(s) cost
   (D)   Provided, however, when the General Manager determines that only one
side of a street can be benefitted and has made collections on that basis,
amounts so collected shall be paid by the city to the applicant who paid the
cost of installing the main, until the applicant has received an amount equal
to “R” as calculated in the following formula:
         R = T- (1.10 x C x F) - Z wherein
      T = total cost of installing eight-inch main and laterals
      C = cost per foot of installing eight-inch main
      F = number of feet of installing applicant’s property fronting on main
      Z = installing applicant’s lateral(s) cost.

§ 7.20.1125 In-lieu sewer fees.
   Whenever the City Engineer determines it is impractical or unreasonable for
an applicant to install a sanitary sewer main on a street frontage for which
such installation would otherwise be required, the applicant shall pay to the
city an in-lieu fee for their fair share of the future installation of the
main. The fee shall be the same front foot fee as established in §
7.20.1120.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.995) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-

accordance with the applicable provisions of this code may be expended for
construction or reconstruction of the facilities including raising of
facilities to grade or work for which the funds were collected.
(1995 Code, § 7.20.996) (Ord. 17-03, passed 3-21-2017; Ord. 15-02, passed 5-5-
2015)
§ 7.20.1130 Oversize.
   When an applicant installs sewer mains larger than eight inches as directed
by the General Manager, the General Manager shall prepare a reimbursement
agreement after the main has been installed and actual costs determined to be
executed by the applicant and the president of the Board of Public Utilities
pursuant to the provisions of Title 8,
Chapter 8.64 of this code. The amount of oversize reimbursement shall be equal
to the difference in cost between an eight-inch main and the actual size of
main installed. Provided, however, when the General Manager determines that the
installing applicant requires larger than an eight-inch main to serve the
applicant’s whole property, the amount of oversize reimbursement shall be equal
to the difference in cost between the size of main needed by the applicant to
serve the applicant’s whole property and the actual size of main installed.

   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An UPSET does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C), below, are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Director of
Public Works within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
7.20.470 of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §
7.20.480 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its WDR/NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.

§ 7.20.1180 Affirmative defense—Bypass.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section,
   BYPASS. The definition provided in §
7.20.020.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Director of Public Works, at least ten days before
the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public Works of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director of Public Works may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works may take
an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Director of Public Works may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Director of Public Works
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of
this section.

   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the
authority granted by the State of California, under Cal. Vehicle Code § 22660,

thereof as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following declarations:
The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative
vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property including highways is
hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private
property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create
fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and
to be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the
presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle or part
thereof, on private or public property including highways, except as expressly
herein permitted, is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance which may
be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

the removal of each vehicle removed by the city if the vehicle is removed
without a hearing pursuant to §
7.29.100 of this chapter. When the acts required by this chapter are performed
by the county acting on behalf of the city, the administrative costs, if the
vehicle is removed without a hearing, shall be that amount to be determined
from time to time by the Board of Supervisors to be the administrative costs of
removal of abandoned vehicles from unincorporated areas of Tulare County rather
than the amount determined by the City Council. ln those cases in which the
City Manager, or designee, conducts a hearing pursuant to §

which shall be the actual cost of performing acts pertaining to the specific
vehicle which is the subject of the hearing.

The City Council may, from time to time, by resolution, determine the cost of
removal.

the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. The term HIGHWAY

   PUBLIC PROPERTY. Includes "highway."
   VEHICLE. A device by which any person or property may be propelled, moved,
or drawn upon a highway, except a device moved by human power or used
exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks. The term VEHICLE also includes any

provisions of this chapter apply to a part or portion of a vehicle which is
less than a whole vehicle.

opportunities for, and the likelihood of, minors being tempted to purchase,
attempting to purchase and purchasing tobacco products for their own use and
consumption.

   Recreational use of psychoactive bath salts, psychoactive herbal incense and
similar products commonly known as “synthetic drugs” has been documented to
cause hallucinations, agitation, psychosis, aggression, suicidal and homicidal

composition of the compounds in their products so as to escape the purview of
these laws and regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to
provide the city with reasonable measure to address the dangers to the

according to the provisions of Cal. Code of Civil Procedure § 1162. The notice
shall require that the squatter camp be completely abandoned, abated, closed

the land upon which any squatter camp is located, or where no person is in
charge of the same, or where the owner of the land refuses to act, as an
alternative procedure, the City Manager may notify all squatters within the
squatter camp that the same has been condemned and to remove therefrom
immediately. In addition to the oral notification, the City Manager shall post
a written notice in a conspicuous place, within the squatter camp, notifying
all squatters to forthwith and immediately remove there from and vacate the

other remedy available, in order to prevent loss of life or serious injury in
the case of a person or persons squatting within the right of way of any
existing railroad track, violators of this section shall be immediately removed
and relocated from the right of way. The City Manager is authorized to develop
any regulations to address the storage and/or disposal of property remaining in
the railroad right of way, whether abandoned or not.

other discarded or abandoned objects, articles and accumulations, in or upon
any street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain, inlet, catch basin, conduit or any
other drainage structures, business place or upon any public or private plot of
land in the city, so that the same might be or become a pollutant. No person
shall throw or deposit litter in any fountain, pond, lake, stream, irrigation
canal or any other body of water in a park or elsewhere in the city. This
section shall not apply to the storing of such potential pollutants in
containers or in lawfully established waste disposal facilities.
      (2)   Owners of abutting property. The occupants, tenants, owners,
lessees and/or proprietors of any real property in the City of Tulare in front
of which there is a paved sidewalk shall be responsible for maintaining such
sidewalk and keeping the same free of dirt and litter to the maximum extent
practicable. Sweepings from such sidewalk shall not be swept or otherwise made
or allowed to go into the gutter or roadway, but shall be disposed of in
receptacles maintained on such real property as required for the disposal of
garbage.
      (3)   Owners and operators of parking lots and similar structures.
Persons owning or operating a paved parking lot, gas station pavement, paved
private street or road, or similar structure, shall clean those structures in a

city shall keep debris and dirt out of the city's surface water drain system.
The authorized enforcement officer may require any construction contractor
performing work in the city to submit a surface water pollution prevention plan
prior to final map approval by the city or prior to issuance of a building
permit by the city, whichever first occurs.
      (5)   Best management practices for new development and redevelopment.
The authorized enforcement officer may adopt regulations establishing controls
on the volume and rate of surface water runoff for new development and
redevelopment within the city as may be appropriate to minimize the discharge
and transport of pollutants.
      (6)   Notification of intent and compliance with general permits. Each
industrial discharger, discharger associated with construction activity, or
other discharger, described in any general stormwater permit addressing such
discharges, as may be adopted by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, or the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley Region, shall provide notice of
intent, comply with, and undertake all other activities required by any general
stormwater permit applicable to such discharges. Furthermore, each discharger
identified in an individual NPDES permit relating to surface water discharges
shall comply with and undertake all activities required by such permit.
      (7)   Compliance with best management practices. Where best management
practices guidelines or requirements have been defined in the city's surface
water management program or adopted by any federal, state, regional, county
and/or city agency, for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or
contribute to surface water pollution or contamination, and/or discharges of
non-surface water to the surface water system or waters of the United States,
every person undertaking such activity or operation, or owning or operating
such facility, shall comply with such guidelines or requirements. Any person
engaged in activities or operations, or owning facilities or property which
will or may result in pollutants entering surface water, the surface water
drain system or waters of the U.S. shall implement best management practices to
the extent they are technologically achievable to prevent and reduce such
pollutants. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal surface water drain system or
watercourses. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes shall be provided and maintained at the owner or
operator's expense.
      (8)   Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which
a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that
part of the watercourse within the property reasonably free of trash, debris,
excessive vegetation and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition,
the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within
or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard
to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse. The owner or
lessee shall not remove healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually necessary
for maintenance, nor remove such vegetation in such a manner as to increase the
vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The property owner shall be
responsible for maintaining and stabilizing that portion of the watercourse
that is within their property lines in order to protect against erosion and
degradation of the watercourse originating or contributed from their property.

material, pollutants or waste creating a risk of discharge into the city
surface water drain system.
   (B)   As soon as any person in charge of a facility or responsible for
emergency response for a facility has knowledge of any suspected, confirmed or
unconfirmed release of materials, pollutants or waste which may result in
pollutants or non-surface water discharge entering the city surface water drain
system, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment and clean up of such release and notify the city of the occurrence
within two hours of becoming aware of the occurrence.
   (C)   In the event of a release of hazardous materials, such person shall
telephone 911 to report the release immediately. In the event of a release of
nonhazardous materials, see definition of HAZARDOUS MATERIALS in §

information:

the Council sufficient to cover the cost of handling the application as
prescribed in this chapter.
   (C)   Appeal to Council.
      (1)   Within ten days following the date of a decision of the Public
Works Director on a variance application, the decision may be appealed to the
Council by the applicant or any other interested party. An appeal shall be made
on a form prescribed by the Public Works Department and shall be filed with the

error or a breach of discretion by the Public Works Director or wherein the
decision is not supported by the evidence in the record.
      (2)   Within five days of filing of an appeal, the Public Works Director
shall transmit to the Clerk the variance application, and other data filed
therewith, and any reports, findings or other information which the Public
Works Director has used in making a decision on the application.
      (3)   The Clerk shall give notice to the applicant and to the appellant
(if the applicant is not the appellant) and may give notice to any other
interested party of the time when the appeal will be considered by the Council.
   (D)   Action of the Council.
      (1)   The Council may affirm, reverse or modify a decision of the Public
Works Director on a variance application; provided, that if a decision denying
a variance is reversed or a decision granting a variance is modified, the
Council shall, on the basis of the record transmitted by the Public Works
Director and such additional evidence as may be submitted, make the findings
prerequisite to the granting of a variance as prescribed in §
8.12.210(A) of this chapter.
      (2)   A variance which has been the subject of an appeal to the Council
shall become effective three days following the date on which the variance is
granted by the Council.
   (E)   Lapse of variance. A variance shall lapse and shall become void one
year following the date on which the variance became effective unless prior to
the expiration of one year, a building permit is issued by the Building
Inspector and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward
completion on the site which was the subject of the variance application or a
certificate of occupancy is issued by the Planning Officer for the site or
structure which was the subject of the variance application. A variance may be
renewed for an additional period of one year; provided, that prior to the
expiration of one year from the date which the variance originally became
effective, an application for renewal of the variance is made to the Public
Works Director. The Public Works Director may grant or deny an application for
renewal of a variance.
   (F)   Revocation. A variance granted subject to a condition shall be revoked
by the Public Works Director if the condition is not complied with.

§ 8.26.010    Purpose and findings.
   (A)   Purpose. This chapter is adopted to implement the provisions of the
Quimby Act, which authorize a city to require the dedication of land for park
or recreation facilities, or payment of fees in-lieu thereof (or a combination
of both), incident to and as a condition of approval for a tentative map or
parcel map.
      (1)   The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land
and/or payment of a fee in-lieu thereof is required by this chapter are in
accordance with the Open Space and Conservation Element of the General Plan of
the city and shall supersede any previously adopted plan to the extent of any
inconsistency.
      (2)   The land, fees, or combination thereof that are dedicated pursuant
to this chapter are to be used only for the purposes of developing new or
rehabilitating existing pocket, neighborhood, community, or regional park or
recreational facilities to serve the subdivision that prompts the dedication,
and the amount and location of land to be dedicated or the fees to be paid will
bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational
facilities by future inhabitants of the subdivisions subject to this chapter.
   (B)   Findings. The amount of existing park area in the city is currently
below four acres of park area per 1,000 city residents. The enactment of this
chapter prevents new residential development from significantly further
reducing the quality and availability of public services provided to residents
of the city by requiring new residential development to contribute to the cost
of expanding the availability of park and recreational facilities and amenities
in the city.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.020    Authority.
   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the Quimby Act.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.030    Definitions.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the terms and words identified below shall
be defined as follows:
   AVERAGE NUMBER OF PERSONS PER DWELLING UNIT. Average number of persons per
household in the city, based on the most recent data available in the form of
the federal census. The most recent AVERAGE NUMBER OF PERSONS PER DWELLING UNIT
may be reflected in a City Council resolution as determined by the Director,
Community and Economic Development.
   CITY. The City of Tulare.
   DWELLING UNIT. Includes each single-family dwelling, multifamily dwelling,
or each mobile home space designed to contain a mobile home trailer on a semi
permanent or permanent basis. Single-family residential units, multifamily
residential units, and mobile home units shall be defined according to the
latest decennial U.S. or State of California Department of Finance census.
   LAND ACQUISITION COST PER ACRE. The estimated per acre value of vacant
residential land costs in the city as determined by the City Council based upon
receipt sale records or appraisal. The most recent LAND ACQUISITION COST PER
ACRE may be reflected in a City Council resolution. If the subdivider objects
to such a valuation, the subdivider, at its own expense, may obtain an
appraisal of the property by a qualified appraiser approved by the city, whose
appraisal may be accepted or rejected by the City Community and Economic
Development Director.
   MERCHANT BUILDER. An individual, company, partnership, corporation, or
similar entity that obtains land previously subdivided for the purpose of
constructing new residential units upon the subdivided land.
   NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS. The number of dwelling units as determined by the
city based upon the number of units allowed pursuant to the standards of the
city’s Zoning Code or as otherwise specified by the city on the property
included in the subdivision at the time the tentative map or parcel map is
filed for approval.
   PARK DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. An agreement entered pursuant to §
8.26.130 of this chapter.
   QUIMBY ACT. Cal. Gov’t Code § 66477, as amended from time to time, or any
successor statute.
   QUIMBY FEES. Fees paid as a condition to the approval of a tentative map or
parcel map pursuant to this chapter and the Quimby Act in lieu of dedicating
land to the city for park and recreational purposes.
   RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. Any development that creates new or increases the
number of existing dwelling units on a property.
   SUBDIVISION MAP ACT. Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 66410 et seq., as amended from time
to time, or any successor statute.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.040   Parkland dedication standard.
   All standards for park dedication and improvement shall comply with the
Quimby Act, the California Subdivision Map Act, the Parks Master Plan, and the
Open Space and Conservation Element of the city’s General Plan. The dedication
and improvement of land and/or Quimby fees for park or recreational purposes
shall be at the rate of either three or four acres of park area (and/or Quimby
fees) per 1,000 subdivision residents, with this amount determined by the
existing service level at the time of application for a tentative map or parcel
map. If the existing service level of park area at the time of subdivision
application exceeds four acres per 1,000 residents, the rate will be four acres
per 1,000 residents. However, the rate will be three acres per 1,000 residents
if the existing service level of developed park area at the time of subdivision
application is less than four acres per 1,000 residents.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.050   Parkland dedication and/or in-lieu fee requirements.
   As a condition of approval of any tentative map or parcel map, the city
shall require the dedication of land and/or improvements/amenities, or payment
of a fee in-lieu thereof, or a combination of both, at the option of the city,
for park or recreational purposes to serve the future residents of the
subdivided property.
   (A)   This requirement shall apply to all residential subdivisions, except
those exempted by the Quimby Act.
   (B)   Except as provided in division (C), below, if a proposed subdivision
contains less than 50 parcels, the subdivider shall not be required to dedicate
any land for park and recreational purposes without his or her consent but may
instead choose to pay a fee equivalent to the rate of four acres per 1,000
residents, in accordance with §
8.26.060(B), below.
   (C)   When a condominium, stock cooperative, or community apartment project
exceeds 50 dwelling units, dedication of land may be required notwithstanding
that the number of parcels may be less than 50. Pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code §
66477(e), these kinds of developments shall be eligible to receive a credit, as
determined by the legislative body, against the amount of land required to be
dedicated, or the amount of the fee imposed, pursuant to this section, for the
value of private open space within the development which is usable for active
recreational uses.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the requirement in this section that fees be used to
serve the subdivision for which the fees were paid, fees may be used for the
purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing park or recreational
facilities in a neighborhood other than the neighborhood in which the
subdivision for which fees were paid as a condition to the approval of a
tentative map or parcel map is located, if all of the following conditions are
met:
      (1)   The neighborhood in which the fees are to be expended has fewer
than three acres of park area per 1,000 members of the neighborhood population.
      (2)   The neighborhood in which the subdivision for which the fees were
paid has a park area per 1,000 members of the neighborhood population that
meets or exceeds the ratio calculated pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   The City Council holds a public hearing before using the fees
pursuant to this chapter, and at that public hearing, makes a finding supported
by evidence that it is reasonably foreseeable that future inhabitants of the
subdivision for which the fee is imposed will use the proposed park and
recreational facilities in the alternative neighborhood where the fees are
spent.
      (4)   The fees shall be used within the geographic boundaries of the
city, so long as a reasonable relationship can be demonstrated between the
location of the use of the fees and the subdivision for which the fees were
paid.
      (5)   The fees shall be used in a manner consistent with the Parks Master
Plan and the Open Space and Conservation Element of the city’s General Plan, as
well as any policy, standard, principle or guideline adopted in accordance
therewith.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.060   Formulas for calculating amount of parkland dedication and/or
Quimby fees.
   (A)   Formula for calculating the “dedication of land”. Where the
requirements of this chapter are solely complied with on the basis of providing
parkland, the minimum amount of land measured in acres to be provided shall be
based on the existing level of service for developed park area per 1,000
residents as stipulated in §
8.26.040 of this chapter:
 
Number of Dwelling   Average Number of   .003 (3 Acres per   Number of Acres to
Units              X Persons per       X 1,000 Residents)  = be Dedicated
                     Dwelling Unit
OR                                                       
Number of Dwelling   Average Number of   .004 (4 Acres per   Number of Acres to
Units              X Persons per       X 1,000 Residents)  = be Dedicated
                     Dwelling Unit
 
   Whenever land is dedicated pursuant to this chapter, the subdivider shall
provide the public improvements, as set forth in §
8.26.070 of this chapter.
   (B)   Formula for calculating the fee amount “Quimby fees”. Where the
requirements of this chapter are solely complied with on the basis of the
payment of in-lieu fees, such fees shall be calculated, at either of the two
ratios stipulated in §
8.26.040 of this chapter, on a per residential unit basis, as follows:
 
Number of        Average Number   .003 (3 Acres   Land            Total Quimby
Dwelling Units X of Persons per X per 1,000     X Acquisition   = Fee
                 Dwelling Unit    Residents)      Cost per Acre
OR                                                          
Number of        Average Number   .004 (4 Acres   Land            Total Quimby
Dwelling Units X of Persons per X per 1,000     X Acquisition   = Fee
                 Dwelling Unit    Residents)      Cost per Acre
 
   The Land Acquisition Cost per Acre amount of the Quimby fees may be adopted
by resolution of the City Council. The Council may adopt and/or revise the fee
amount as often as on an annual basis.
   (C)   Formula for calculating a combination of dedicated land and Quimby
fees. Where the requirements of this chapter are complied with by both the
provision of parkland and payment of Quimby fees, the amount of the Quimby fees
shall be computed by determining the required amount of parkland in accordance
with the provisions of division (A) and subtracting the amount of parkland
actually provided. The remainder shall be converted to a fee in accordance with
the provisions of division (B).
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.070    Public improvements on dedicated parkland.
   The subdivider shall provide utility and full street improvements consistent
with the Circulation Element of the adopted General Plan and the city’s
subdivision regulations in
Chapter 8.24 of the Tulare Municipal Code, including but not limited to curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, street paving, sewer, water and drainage improvements. The
full cost of such improvements shall be borne by the subdivider and shall not
be deducted from or credited against any fees or other amounts due the city
under this chapter or otherwise. The land to be dedicated and improvements to
be made pursuant to this chapter shall be approved by the city.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.080    Criteria for requiring combination of parkland dedication and
Quimby fees.
   For subdivisions consisting of 50 or more units, the subdivider shall have
the option to either dedicate land or pay Quimby fees or a combination of both
on the following basis:
   (A)   General Plan requirements. When only a portion of the subdivision is
proposed for a future park site(s) in conformance with this chapter, such
portion shall be dedicated to the city for park and recreational purposes
pursuant to the dedication standards set forth in §
8.26.040, and any remaining parkland dedication requirements shall be satisfied
through Quimby fees computed pursuant to §§
8.26.060(A) and (B). If no parkland dedication is provided, the subdivider
shall pay Quimby fees for the full three or four acres per 1,000 residents
computed pursuant to §
8.26.060(C).
   (B)   Remainder dedications. When a major portion of a park or recreational
site/facility serving the proposed subdivision has already been acquired by the
city, and only a portion of additional land is needed from the subdivision to
complete the site/facility, such remaining portion shall be dedicated to the
city pursuant to the standards set forth in §
8.26.040, and any remaining parkland dedication requirements shall be satisfied
through Quimby fees computed pursuant to §
8.26.060(C). Such fees may be used for either the improvement of the existing
park and recreational site/facility or for the improvement of other park and
recreational sites/facilities serving the subdivision at the sole discretion of
the city.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.090    Determination as to requirement for fee or dedication.
   (A)   Whether the city accepts land dedication or elects to require payment
of Quimby fees, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration
of the following:
      (1)   Reasonable relationship. That the amount and location of land to be
dedicated or the fees to be paid shall bear a reasonable relationship to the
use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the
subdivision.
      (2)   Compatibility. Compatibility of dedication with the Open Space and
Conservation Element of the city’s General Plan and any policy, standard,
principle or guideline adopted in accordance therewith.
      (3)   Physical characteristics. Topography, geology, access, and location
of land in the development available for dedication.
      (4)   General suitability. Suitability for patrol, supervision, and
maintenance.
      (5)   Geographic dimensions. Size and shape of the development and land
available for dedication.
      (6)   Feasibility. The feasibility of dedication.
      (7)   Alternative and additional parkland in the vicinity. Availability
of previously acquired park property.
   (B)   The determination of the Planning Commission upon the recommendation
of the Community and Economic Development Director as to whether land shall be
dedicated or whether Quimby fees shall be paid, or a combination of both, shall
be based upon the above factors in the totality of the circumstances, and shall
be final and conclusive, unless timely appealed to the City Council pursuant to
§
10.20.020 “Appeal” of the Tulare Municipal Code.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.100    Procedure for making payment or dedication.
   (A)   Application by subdivider. At the time of filing a tentative map or
parcel map application, the subdivider shall, as part of such filing, state in
writing whether it desires to dedicate property for park and recreational
purposes, or to pay Quimby fees, or a combination of both. If the subdivider
desires to dedicate land for this purpose, the area shall be designated on the
tentative tract map or parcel map as submitted.
   (B)   Action of city. At the time of the tentative tract map or parcel map
approval and in accordance with the criteria set forth in this chapter, the
Quimby Act, the California Subdivision Map Act, the Open Space and Conservation
Element of the city’s General Plan and any policy, standard, principle or
guideline adopted in accordance therewith, the City Community and Economic
Development Director shall determine as part of such approval, whether to
require a dedication of the land within the subdivision, payment of Quimby
fees, or a combination of both, based upon the totality of circumstances. The
conditions of approval of any applicable tentative map or a parcel map shall
require the dedication of land, the payment of Quimby fees, or a combination of
both for park and recreational purposes to serve the future inhabitants of the
subdivision. If the land is to be dedicated, the proposed dedication shall be
shown on the approved tentative map or parcel map.
   (C)   Payment of in-lieu fees. Prior to the issuance of a building permit,
the Community and Economic Development Director or his/her designee shall
determine the amount of land to be dedicated and/or Quimby fees to be paid by
the subdivider. Any fee required under this chapter shall be paid directly to
the city prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy of any
dwelling unit in the subdivision. The fees shall be placed in a specially
designated fund and are used only for the acquisition and development of new,
or improvement and/or rehabilitation of existing, park and recreational
facilities. Any fees collected under this chapter shall be appropriated by the
City Council, but need not be spent, within five years after the payment of
such fees or the issuance of building permits on one half of the lots created
by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If such fees are not appropriated,
they shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision
in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of
all lots within the subdivision.
   (D)   Dedication of parkland. A dedication of parkland shall be made prior
to the recordation of any applicable tentative map or parcel map. Where
dedication is offered and accepted, such dedication shall be accomplished in
accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. All land dedicated
to the city shall be conveyed in fee simple to the city free and clear of all
encumbrances except those which will not interfere with the use of the property
for its intended purposes and which the city agrees to accept.
   (E)   Improvement of parkland. The subdivider may choose to improve the
dedicated parkland with amenities such as grass, trees, playground equipment
and other improvements typical of a city park. If such improvements are made to
the dedicated parkland, the cost of said improvements shall be estimated and
applied as a credit against the parkland or the in-lieu fee identified as
required per the calculation identified in §
8.26.060. The cost of said improvements and associated credit shall be
determined in a manner meeting the approval of the Community Services Director.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 8-15-2023)
§ 8.26.110   Procedure for merchant builders.
   (A)   When a proposed subdivision is a part of a major land development
project, and the owner of such land proposes to permit development by one or
more merchant builders, provisions for park and recreational facilities shall
be made by the major landowner through the adoption of a comprehensive plan and
not by the individual merchant builders. Where park and recreation facilities
have been dedicated by requirements of the city in excess of this chapter’s
requirements, the major landowner may, at the discretion of the city, be given
100% credit for the excess on subsequent projects within the adopted
comprehensive plan.
   (B)   For the purpose of this chapter, a MAJOR LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
shall be a land development project exceeding 40 acres in size.
   (C)   Where development is proposed for construction in increments, a
schedule for providing the park and recreation facilities shall be submitted
for consideration by the city. All park facilities shall be developed
consistent with any schedule approved by the city.

existing public improvements or street trees.
   (B)   Any property owner desiring to remove a tree from the parkway or
easement abutting his or her property shall make application to the Department.
The Director shall determine whether or not the tree is required to be retained
in order to preserve the intent and purpose of the Street Tree Plan. In making
a determination, the Director shall consider the inconvenience or hardship
which retention of the tree would cause the property owner, and consider also
the condition, age, desirability of tree species and location. If the Director
finds that the tree may be removed without violating the intent and spirit of
the Street Tree Plan, the property owner may be authorized to remove such tree
at the property owner’s own expense and liability providing that any trees
removed shall be replaced by street trees in that location or elsewhere in the
city as approved by the Director. Any replacement shall be made based upon
evaluation by the Director of the condition of the site to determine whether
replacement is warranted. If a permit is granted for removal of a street tree,
all removal work shall be completed within 60 days from the date of issuance of
the permit and shall be under the general supervision of, and in accordance
with, rules established by the Director. All tree stumps shall be removed to a
depth specified by the Director. All removal permits shall be null and void
after the expiration of 60 days from the date of issuance, unless extended by
the Director or designee.
   (C)   In determining whether a tree may be removed and replaced, the
Director shall consider, among other things, the following:
      (1)   Whether the tree or trees pose a potential for safety problems
despite a sound maintenance program;
      (2)   Whether the roots from adjacent parkway trees are interfering with
sewer lines
servicing the abutting property to the extent that the property owner requires
frequent repair of said sewer lines;
      (3)   Whether the tree is dead, dying or incurably diseased;
      (4)   Whether the tree is diseased and weakened by age, storm, fire or
other injuries so as to pose a danger to persons, property, improvements or
other trees;
      (5)   Whether the tree is of an undesirable species;
      (6)   Whether the tree poses a hardship to the adjacent property owner
such as, but not limited to, the cracking or raising of a garage floor or, in
the case of a handicapped person, special circumstances exist which cause the
location of the tree to become a hindrance for vehicle, and handicapped access;
and
      (7)   Whether removal is necessary for construction of a street widening
or other public improvement project, or necessary street or public improvement
repair work.
(1995 Code, § 8.32.110) (Ord. 08-12, passed 7-15-2008)
§ 8.32.120   Standards and specifications.
   All tree work in public parkways, whether by the city, abutting property

   It is the intent of the City of Tulare that certain desirable street trees,
bearing unique characteristics, and certain designated “heritage trees” be
preserved even if the desirable or heritage trees are damaging adjacent
pavement and property. Efforts to preserve such trees shall be made using one
or more of the following procedures, giving due consideration to the site
conditions of the tree:
   (A)   The use of gravel or packed decomposed granite or rubber sidewalk in
place of concrete or asphalt paving over tree roots;
   (B)   The realignment of the sidewalk and curb around a problem root area;
and
   (C)   Root pruning combined with installation of root control devices, and
pavement restoration, to the extent the city has funds available to undertake
such a project.
   (D)   All heritage trees require a pruning permit or removal permit from the
department before any work may begin.
(1995 Code, § 8.32.130) (Ord. 08-12, passed 7-15-2008)
§ 8.32.140   Tree preservation in construction areas.
   (A)   Any tree growing upon public property which is to be removed for
construction purposes shall be replaced, if site conditions permit, in
accordance with the city’s tree planting policy. If the Director determines
that a tree can be replaced, the person causing its removal shall, at their own
expense, remove and replace such tree with a tree, or trees, at a location and
of a size, number and species to be determined by the Director.
   (B)   Any tree growing upon public property near any excavation,
construction or street work shall be sufficiently guarded and protected by
those responsible for such work so as to prevent any injury to the tree. No
person shall excavate any ditches, tunnels or trenches, or install pavement
within a radius of four feet from any street tree without written permission of
the Director.

§ 8.56.010 Legislative findings.
   The City Council of the City of Tulare hereby finds and declares as follows.
   (A)   The State of California, through the enactment of Cal. Gov't Code §§
66001 through 66009 has, among other things, determined the nexus that must be
established in the enactment of development impact fees.
   (B)   The imposition of development impact fees is one of the preferred
methods of ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the cost of
public facilities and service improvements necessary to accommodate new
development. This must be done in order to promote and protect the public
health, safety and welfare.
   (C)   This chapter recognizes that all new development within the city will
result in additional growth and that the growth will place additional burdens
on various city facilities, infrastructure and services. This chapter further
recognizes the types of land development that will generate impacts
necessitating the acquisition of land and construction of public facilities and
expansion of services and infrastructure in order to meet and accommodate them.
   (D)   All land uses within the city should bear a proportionate financial
burden in the construction and improvement of public facilities and services
necessary to serve them.
   (E)   The cost of providing public facilities and service improvements
occasioned by development projects within the City of Tulare exceeds the
revenue generated by fees exacted from the development projects.
   (F)   The City of Tulare hereby adopts the Impact Fee report from
TischlerBise dated October 22, 2019 which establishes the costs for providing
public facilities and service improvements occasioned by development projects
within the City of Tulare.
   (G)   The development impact fees established by this chapter are based upon
the costs which are generated through the need for new facilities and other
capital acquisition costs required, incrementally by new development within the
City of Tulare.
   (H)   The fees established by this chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost
of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the
City of Tulare.
   (I)   The fees established by this chapter relate rationally to the
reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development
projects within the City of Tulare, which public facilities are consistent with
the General Plan and the various Elements of the General Plan of the City of
Tulare.
   (J)   The public facilities and anticipated future development herein
referenced are based upon an analysis of existing land use and zoning.
   (K)   The fees established by this chapter are consistent with the goals and
objectives of the city's General Plan and are designed to mitigate the impacts
caused by new development throughout the city. Development impact fees are
necessary in order to finance the required public facilities and service
improvements and to pay for new development's fair share of their construction
costs.
   (L)   Imposition of fees to finance public facilities and service
improvements is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.

Public properties shall be classified into either the residential, commercial
or industrial land use category, and shall pay fees pursuant to that
classification, as determined by the Director of Planning of the city (herein
"Planning Director") or his or her duly authorized designee. All fees due
hereunder shall be determined and calculated by the City Engineer (herein "City
Engineer") or his or her duly authorized designee. The City Engineer or his or
her designee shall have the further authority to determine the specific amount
of development impact fees to be assessed against a use which is not
specifically or typically associated with the various land use zone districts
for which the development impact fees are established. In the determination and
calculation, the City Engineer shall establish a written record of the
calculation and nexus to infrastructure impacts for the projects identified
above.
(Ord. 19-08, passed 12-17-2019)
§ 8.56.080 Payment of fees.
   The fees established pursuant to this chapter shall be paid for the property
on which a development project is proposed at the time of the issuance of any
required building permit, except as otherwise provided below.
   (A)   Fees imposed on residential development shall be collected in
accordance with the provisions of Cal. Gov't Code § 66007, as the same
presently exists or may hereafter be amended from time to time. An applicant
for a residential building permit may request that payment be deferred until
the date of final inspection. The request shall be approved when the property
owner posts proper security in the form of cash deposit, letter of credit or
other similar instrument retrievable at the time a request is made for final
inspection and fees paid, or executes a contract to pay the fee at the time a
request is made for final inspection. The form and manner of the security or
contract shall be approved by the City Manager.
   (B)   Fees imposed on industrial and commercial development may be deferred
by action of the City Council. The action shall consist of the adoption of a
resolution consistent with the following terms and conditions:
      (1)   A determination is made that such action will promote and stimulate
economic development within the city. The City Council shall make specific
findings setting forth how the subject project accomplishes this goal;
      (2)   Establish a specific timetable for payment in full of the deferred
fees. The City Council may also require a percentage to be paid with the
issuance of a building permit. In no event shall deferral of payment in full be
permitted for more than five years;
      (3)   Interest on the unpaid portion of deferred impact fees shall accrue
at a rate equal to the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) interest rate in
effect at the time the resolution is adopted and shall be articulated in the
resolution. Interest shall be due and payable, in full, with the final payment,
although interest may be paid earlier at the election of the party developing
the project;
      (4)   A written guarantee of payment in full of the impact fees, in the
form of a surety bond or some other form of surety instrument as may be
acceptable to the City Engineer and the City Attorney, shall be executed and
delivered to the city prior to the issuance of a building permit for the
project. Interest in real property may be deemed an appropriate form of surety;
and
      (5)   A determination is made that the deferral of the fees shall not
materially affect the financial ability of the city to satisfy its then current
five-year capital improvement program.
   (C)   Development impact fees shall be paid prior to map recordation or deed
recordation on parcels intended for water well sites, storm drainage basins,
park, police, fire or other government facilities.

appropriate fund referenced in §
8.56.060 of this chapter. All fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be the
fees in effect at the time of collection; provided that fees collected pursuant
to division (B) hereinabove shall be those in effect at the time the City
Council adopts the required resolution.

§ 8.56.090 Fee adjustments.
   (A)   A developer of any project subject to the fees described herein may
apply to the City Council for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of any one or
more of the fees, based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or
nexus between the impacts of that development and either the amount of the fee
(s) charged or the type of facilities to be financed. The application shall be
made in writing and filed with the City Clerk not later than:
      (1)   Ten days prior to the public hearing on the development permit
application for the project; or
      (2)   If no development permit is required, at the time of the filing of
the request for a building permit.
   (B)   The application shall state in .detail the factual basis for the claim
of waiver, reduction or adjustment.
   (C)   The City Council shall consider the application at the public hearing
on the permit application or at a separate public hearing held within 60 days
after the filing of the fee adjustment application, whichever is later. The
hearing shall be noticed and conducted in the same fashion and manner as
prescribed by the laws of the city for hearing on development permits. The
decision of the City Council shall be final.
      (1)   If a reduction, adjustment or waiver is granted, any change in use
within the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the
fee if the change in use would render the same inappropriate.
      (2)   The City Council may, from time to time, and as the need may arise,
set forth, by resolution, specific limitations which will apply to reductions,
adjustments or waivers of development impact fees which may be made pursuant to
this section. In this regard, this chapter shall be considered enabling and
directory.

Tulare (herein "City Manager"), or his or her duly authorized designee, shall
present to the City Council a proposed five-year capital improvement program
for the various public facilities referenced in the resolution adopted pursuant
to §
8.56.030 of this chapter assigning monies (including any accrued interest) from

retain 1% of the fee to offset a portion of the costs of collection and refund.
The fee payer must submit an application for such a refund to the City Manager
within 30 calendar days of the expiration of the permit. Failure to timely
submit the required application for refund shall constitute a waiver of any
right to the refund.

adopted pursuant to §
8.56.030 of this chapter as a condition of approval of a development permit may
request an in-lieu credit of the specific development impact fee(s) involved
for the same development. Upon request, an in-lieu credit of fees shall be
granted for facilities or improvements that mitigate all or a portion of the
need therefor that is attributable to and reasonably related to the given
development. To be eligible for in-lieu fee credits, the facilities or
improvements must be constructed at prevailing wage rates.
      (2)   Only costs proportional to the amount of the improvement or
facility that mitigates the need therefor attributable to and reasonably
related to the given development shall be eligible for in-lieu credit, and then
only against the specific, relevant fee(s) involved to which the facility or
improvement relates.
      (3)   Fees required under this chapter shall be reduced by the actual
construction costs of the facilities or improvements that relate to the fees,
as demonstrated by the applicant and reviewed and approved by the City
Engineer, all consistent with the provisions of divisions (A)(1) and (2) above.
Subject to the applicable provisions of division (B) of this section, if the

reimbursement for construction of improvements or facilities, or dedication of
land or rights-of-way, shall submit the documentation, including without
limitation, engineering drawings, specifications and construction cost
estimates based upon prevailing wage rates, and utilize such methods as may be
appropriate and acceptable to the City Engineer to support the request for
credit or reimbursement. The City Engineer shall determine credit for
construction of improvements or facilities based upon either these cost
estimates or upon alternative engineering criteria and construction cost
estimates if he or she determines that such estimates submitted by the
developer are either unreliable or inaccurate. Prior to city approval of a
Notice of Completion and subsequent execution of an Oversized Construction
Reimbursement Agreement per
Chapter 8.64: Oversized Construction Reimbursement, in which final
reimbursement costs are defined, the maximum credit given for construction of
improvements shall not exceed 80% of their estimated cost. The City Engineer
shall determine whether facilities or improvements are eligible for credit or
reimbursement.

CHAPTER 8.68: CABLE TELEVISION
Section
   
8.68.010   Purpose and application.
   
8.68.020   State video franchise fees.
   
8.68.030   Audit authority.
   
8.68.040   Customer service penalties under state video franchises.
   
8.68.050   City response to state video franchise applications.
§ 8.68.010   Purpose and application.
   This chapter is designed to regulate video service providers holding state
video franchises and operating within the city.
   On January 1, 2007, the State of California became the sole authority with
power to grant state video franchise pursuant to the Digital Infrastructure and
Video Competition Act of 2006 (“DIVCA”). Pursuant to DIVCA, the City of Tulare
shall receive a franchise fee from all state franchises. Additionally, each
state franchisee must remit to the city its pro rata share of any cash payments
for the ongoing costs of public, education, and governmental access channel
facilities or institutional networks, as long as there are such payment
obligations imposed by a city issued franchise. DIVCA confirmed that the city
may establish and enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all
state video franchise holders operating within the city for violations of
customer service standards. DIVCA precludes the city from adopting its own
standards and grants all authority to adopt customer service standards to the
state. DIVCA leaves unchanged the city’s authority to regulate the city’s
current cable franchises and any city franchise(s) issue on or before January
1, 2008, until the expiration of any such franchise(s).
(Ord. 16-07, passed 6-21-2016)

   Not more than once annually, the City Manager or his/her designee may
examine and perform an audit of the business records of a holder of a state
video franchise to ensure compliance with §
8.68.020.
(Ord. 16-07, passed 6-21-2016)
§ 8.68.040   Customer service penalties under state video franchises.
   (A)   The holder of a state video franchise shall comply with all applicable
state and federal customer service and protection standards pertaining to the
provision of video service.
   (B)   The City Manager or his designee shall monitor the compliance of state
video franchise holders with respect to state and federal customer service and
protection standards. The City Manager or his/her designee will provide the
state video franchise holder written notice of any material breaches of
applicable customer service standards, and will allow the state video franchise
holder 30 days from the receipt of the notice to remedy the specific material
breach. Material breaches not remedied within the 30 day time period will be
subject to the following penalties to be imposed by the city:
      (1)   For the first occurrence of a violation, a fine of up to $500 may
be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed $1,500
for each violation.
      (2)   For a second violation of the same nature within 12 months, a fine
of up to $1,000 may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect,
not to exceed $3,000 for each violation.
      (3)   For a third or further violation of the same nature within 12
months, a fine of up to $2,500 may be imposed for each day the violation
remains in effect, not to exceed $7,500 for each violation.
   (C)   A state video franchise holder may appeal a penalty assessed by the
City Manager to the City Council within 60 days of the initial assessment. The
City Council shall hear all evidence and relevant testimony and may uphold,
modify or vacate the penalty. The City Council’s decision on the imposition of
a penalty shall be final.
(Ord. 16-07, passed 6-21-2016)
§ 8.68.050   City response to state video franchise applications.
   (A)   Applicants for state video franchises within the boundaries of the
city must concurrently provide complete copies to the city of any application
or amendments to applications filed with the California Public Utilities
Commission (PUC). One complete copy must be provided to the City Manager.
   (B)   Within 30 days of receipt, the City Manager will provide any
appropriate comments to the PUC regarding an application or an amendment to an
application for a state video franchise.

tax transfer agreement based on the anticipated financial impacts to the city;
      (5)   Prepare and publish factual information describing likely impacts
to the residents in the proposed annexation area and to the city in connection
with the proposed action. Such information should include, but not be limited
to, any information that might be helpful with the process and in describing
differences between being in the county and being in the city such as the

this code.
   (C)   Regardless of whether that occurs, the city's efforts to obtain fair
share contributions from the other agencies for impact related costs and LAFCO
imposed terms and conditions will be the same whether the annexation process is
commenced by a resolution for application of annexation or by landowner/voter
petition directly to LAFCO.

§ 10.33.010   Purpose.
   The purpose of the Small Lot Residential District (R-1-4) is to provide
living areas within the city where development is proposed to achieve compact
development with lot sizes in the range of 3,200 sq. ft. to 4,000 sq. ft.
(1995 Code, § 10.33.010) (Ord. 05-1988, passed - -2005)
§ 10.33.020   Objectives.
   The objectives of the Small Lot Residential district are:
   (A)   Thee development of compact single-family residential neighborhoods at
densities typically in the six to eight units per acre range;
   (B)   The development of compact residential neighborhoods that exhibit high
standards of design that are within close proximity to private or public parks
or amenities;
   (C)   To provide for a compact development with narrow lot widths that
minimize the dominate characteristics of garages on the streetscape; and
   (D)   To provide for an additional housing type and address issues of
affordability.
(1995 Code, § 10.33.020) (Ord. 05-1988, passed - -2005)
§ 10.33.030   Application and fee.
   (A)   An application for a small lot residential development shall be made
to the Development Services Department, Planning Division, on a form prescribed
by the Department. A fee set by resolution of the City Council shall accompany
the application.
   (B)   The following applications are required for a small lot residential
development:
      (1)   A conditional use permit application; and
      (2)   A zone amendment application to rezone the property to R-1-4.
(1995 Code, § 10.33.030) (Ord. 05-1988, passed - -2005)
§ 10.33.040   Applicability to General Plan and Official Zoning Map.
   A small lot residential development may be located on any land designated
residential, except rural residential, on the General Plan Land Use map. Where
approved, Small Lot Residential developments shall be designed as R-1-4 on the
Official Zoning Map.
(1995 Code, § 10.33.040) (Ord. 05-1988, passed - -2005)
§ 10.33.050   Findings.
   (A)   The following findings shall be made for small lot residential
developments:
      (1)   That the proposed project is consistent with the purpose and
objectives of this chapter and the zone district in which the project is
located;
      (2)   That the proposed project will not be detrimental to the public
interest, health, safety or welfare or materially injurious to properties or
materials injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity; and
      (3)   That the proposed project is consistent with the Tulare General
Plan.
   (B)   That development of RM zoned properties to small lot residential
development will not materially affect the supply of vacant land zoned for
multi-family rental development. For the purposes of making this finding, the
availability or supply of a minimum of vacant 60 acres zoned for multi-family
residential development (R-M zoning) would not be considered to materially
affect the supply of vacant land zoned for multi-family rental development.

10.36.070   Design standards.
§ 10.36.010   Purpose.
   The purpose of the Multiple-Family Residential (R-M) district is to provide
living areas within the city where development is permitted at relatively dense
concentrations of dwellings.
(1995 Code, § 10.36.010) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)
§ 10.36.020   Objectives.
   The objectives of the R-M district are:
   (A)   The development of a suitable environment for family life, recognizing
that a significant part of multiple-family population are adults, including
older adults;
   (B)   The creation of vibrant residential neighborhoods that exhibit high
standards of design, including the following features:
      (1)   Attractive, tree-lined streets, which emphasize and encourage
walking and bicycling as well as efficient automobile transit. In such
neighborhoods, the sidewalk will be set back from the street, providing space
for a tree-lined parking strip; and
      (2)   Multiple-family units designed in a manner which encourages human
activity in the front yard, by placing front doors facing the street, providing
front porches, and reducing the dominance of parking facilities as a prominent
feature in the front yard.
   (C)   To provide for limited commercial uses on the same site of multiple-
family developments. The commercial uses shall be operated as a subordinate
part of the multiple-family development. This type of land use arrangement will
work to reduce the need for residents to travel to offsite stores for basic
consumer needs;
   (D)   To provide space for community facilities needed to compliment urban
residential areas and for institutions which require a residential environment;
and
   (E)   To minimize traffic congestion, while providing an efficient
circulation system.

(1995 Code, § 10.36.060) (Ord. 05-1991, passed 11-15-2005; Ord. 00-1854, passed
- -2000)
§ 10.36.070   Design standards.
   The following standards apply to all development occurring within the RM
district and are intended to promote high standards of design.
   (A)   (1)   Building design. Architectural treatment of structures,
including materials, colors and dimensions, should be compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood. The following standards should be considered in the
design of multiple-family residential developments:
         (a)   Building facades. Building facades shall be designed utilizing
varying setbacks, projections, balconies, and by varying the pattern and
location of windows and doors on the building face.
         (b)   Design techniques. The following design techniques are
encouraged:
            1.   Setbacks should be varied within individual structures.
            2.   Floor plans should be reversed on adjacent units within the
same structure.
            3.   There should only be a maximum of two adjacent units with
identical wall and roofline planes.
            4.   Long, unbroken facades and box-like building forms are
discouraged.
      (2)   Doorways and windows.
         (a)   Doors and windows shall be clearly articulated on the face of
the structure.
         (b)   Methods for articulating windows include wood framing, insets,
and shutters. Doorways can be articulated with insets and wood framing, along
with the use of doors with distinctive patterns or carving. When possible,
multiple-family buildings should face onto streets, rather than turned sideways
on the lot.
      (3)   Building materials. Materials used for multiple-family developments
should be durable and low maintenance. Where possible, materials should emulate
distinctive features of surrounding existing development.
      (4)   Exterior stairways. Stairways should be designed as an integral
part of the overall structure and should incorporate materials used in the main
building. Prefabricated stairways composed of concrete and open wrought iron
railing is discouraged.
   (B)   Parking facilities. Parking lots, driveways and entries should be
designed to blend in with the overall project:
      (1)   Long, unbroken rows of parking spaces are discouraged. Where
possible, individual attached garages (with garage doors) for each unit are
preferred. Otherwise, dispersed parking lots and heavy landscaping can serve to
break up large parking areas.
      (2)   Parking rows shall be broken up with a landscape island every eight
spaces.
      (3)   Special treatment should be given to project entryways, including
the use of landscaping, walls, fountains, signs and other architectural
features such as arbors and trellises. Entryway paving should be given special
treatment, such as stamped paving, colored paving, or cobblestones.
      (4)   Parking areas shall be screened from view from adjoining properties
and street right-of-ways by means of a solid fence, wall, landscaping or
architectural feature.
   (C)   Multiple-family infill in existing neighborhoods. Extreme care must be
taken to ensure that multiple-family development in existing neighborhoods is
compatible in appearance with existing residences, especially single-family
dwellings.
      (1)   Setbacks. Front yard setbacks for infill development should be the
average of that for adjacent properties. If one adjacent property is vacant,
then the average shall be calculated using the next adjacent occupied parcel.
      (2)   Architectural design. New infill development should incorporate
distinctive architectural features and maintain the scale and proportions of
existing neighborhood dwellings, including building materials and colors, roof
pitch and style, porches, window and doorway design, and other important
elements.
   (D)   Landscaping. In addition to the following requirements, projects shall
be landscaped in accordance with the requirements contained in
Chapter 10.196, Landscaping.
      (1)   All outdoor areas not used for parking, walkways or other features
shall be landscaped, but not less than 10% of the total site area of each
parcel shall be landscaped.
      (2)   A children’s play yard with play equipment shall be required for
all multiple-family projects of ten units or more, and must be reviewed and
approved by the Planning and Building Director, and Parks and Community
Services Director. This condition shall not apply to senior citizen housing or
other housing excepted by the City of Tulare.
      (3)   Street trees shall be planted in accordance with the tree type and
planting schedule available from the Parks and Community Services Department.
Street trees shall be planted no more than 40 feet apart.
   (E)   Miscellaneous.
      (1)   Wherever multiple-family residential uses abut commercial uses,
industrial uses or other undesirable features such as freeways, a solid seven-
foot tall block wall and dense landscaping shall be provided along abutting
property lines and special consideration shall be given to location and
orientation of the residential structures so as to minimize any harmful effects
created by nearby nonresidential uses. Along streets designated as arterial or
primary thoroughfares, the Planning Commission may require proposed uses to
backup to the roadway.
      (2)   Adequate onsite lighting shall be required when deemed necessary.
All onsite lighting shall be directed away from abutting properties to reduce
glare. Adjustment of lighting fixtures may be required after they have been
installed.
      (3)   All trash disposal containers shall be surrounded and screened by a
solid six-foot tall fence, wall or similar architectural feature. Where
possible, trash enclosures shall be further screened with landscaping.
Additional treatments, such as a trellis or arbor, are encouraged.

which serve and are located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods
throughout the community.
(1995 Code, § 10.44.010) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)
§ 10.44.020   Objectives.
   The objectives of the C-1 District are:
   (A)   The development of a limited range of commercial uses that cater to
the daily needs of residents;
   (B)   The development of commercial buildings that are compatible with the
aesthetic character and quality of residential neighborhoods:
      (1)   Attractive, tree-lined streets, which emphasize and encourage
walking and bicycling as well as efficient automobile transit, to serve the
commercial developments. In such neighborhoods, the sidewalk will be setback
from the street, providing space for a tree-lined parking strip; and
      (2)   Commercial buildings designed in a manner which encourages human
activity on the street, by placing main entrances facing the street, and
reducing the dominance of parking facilities as a prominent visual street
feature. Where possible, parking lots should be placed to the rear or to the
side of buildings.
   (C)   To ensure that commercial buildings are designed in a manner which
minimizes the impact to the adjacent residential development though sensitive
design that considers the impacts of noise, traffic and lighting sources; and
   (D)   To minimize traffic congestion, while providing an efficient
circulation system.

CHAPTER 10.60: COMMERCIAL DISTRICT DESIGN GUIDELINES
Section
   
10.60.010   Purposes.
   
10.60.020   Design guidelines.
§ 10.60.010   Purposes.
   The purpose of this chapter is to set forth design guidelines for commercial
development in Tulare that will work to achieve high standards of project
design. These regulations complement the standard site development regulations
listed in the individual zone district chapters. These design regulations are
general in nature and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their
application to specific projects. Issues addressed in this chapter include site
planning, parking and circulation, landscaping, walls, building design, signs
and lighting.
(1995 Code, § 10.60.010) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)
§ 10.60.020   Design guidelines.
   The following guidelines apply to all development occurring within the C
districts and are intended to facilitate high quality development that
complements the character of Tulare.
   (A)   Site design. Design and placement of new buildings must consider the
existing built environment of the surrounding area, in particular existing
setbacks, building size and massing, and color and materials. Towards this end,
the following objectives should be considered:
      (1)   Structures should be sited in a manner that complements adjacent
structures. Sites should be developed in a coordinated manner to provide order
and diversity and avoid a jumbled, confused development.
      (2)   Where applicable, single and multi-structure sites should be
clustered to create plazas or pedestrian malls. New development should designed
to avoid situations where individual buildings sit in the middle of large
parking areas. Where clustering is not possible, a visual link between separate
structures should be established, by various means, including stamped concrete
walkways, arcade systems, trellises or other open structures.
      (3)   Structures should be sited to minimize conflicts between
pedestrians and vehicle traffic. Structures can be linked to adjoining street
sidewalks with textured paving, landscaping and trellises.
      (4)   Outdoor spaces between buildings should be recognized as outdoor
“rooms”that have clear recognizable shapes, as opposed to being considered as
“left over” areas. These spaces can be used to provide important pedestrian
amenities such as benches, trellises, fountains, artwork, etc.
      (5)   Freestanding commercial structures should be oriented with the main
entry towards the street and should have the main facade parallel to the
street.
      (6)   Loading facilities shall be located to the side or rear of
commercial buildings and shall be screened from view to the extent possible.
   (B)   Parking and circulation. Design considerations for parking and
circulation shall include the location of ingress and egress points, pedestrian
and vehicle conflicts, on-site circulation patterns, and service vehicle
functions.
      (1)   Safe pedestrian circulation systems shall be provided in the design
of parking facilities. Pedestrian linkages between buildings in commercial
developments should be strongly emphasized.
      (2)   Provide on-site vehicle circulation, which utilizes main entrances
and avoids awkward turning movements.
      (3)   Common driveways are encouraged to provide access to adjacent sites
and improve on-site circulation.
      (4)   Parking areas shall be generously landscaped to provide interior
and perimeter treatments.
      (5)   Parking lots shall be separated from buildings by raised sidewalks
or curbing, in conjunction with landscaping where appropriate.
      (6)   Parking driveways (access points) should be located as far as
possible from street intersections to avoid traffic problems. The number of
access points should be limited to the minimum amount necessary to provide
adequate circulation.
      (7)   Parking lots for uses that require a large number of spaces should
be divided into a series of connected smaller lots, to the extent possible.
Landscaping and offsetting portions of the lot are effective in reducing the
visual impact of large parking areas.
      (8)   Parking lots should be screened from adjoining streets by the use
of low earth berms, walls, landscaping or a combination of these methods.
   (C)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Landscaping for commercial uses should be used to define specific
areas by helping to focus on entrances to buildings and parking lots, define
the edges of various land uses, provide transition between neighboring
properties, and provide screening for loading and equipment areas.
      (2)   Landscaping around the entire base of structures is recommended to
soften the edge between the parking lot and the building.
      (3)   Trees should be located throughout parking lots not simply at the
ends of aisles.
      (4)   Landscaping must be protected from vehicle encroachment by means of
raised planting areas, walls and curbs.
      (5)   Vines and climbing plants integrated on buildings, trellises and
perimeter garden walls are recommended, in order to soften the hard appearance
of permanent structures.
   (D)   Walls and fences.
      (1)   To the extent possible, walls should be designed to blend with the
overall architectural character of the site, including material, color and
texture. Where possible, landscaping should be used to soften the appearance of
walls.
      (2)   Walls should not be blank, long surfaces, but rather should be
articulated with intervening pillars, alternating heights, offsetting sections
and materials that provide variety, including material texturing (as with
plaster treatments).
      (3)   Screening fences should be compatible with the overall site design.
Chain link fencing with slats is acceptable for areas not visible from the
street. Exterior storage should be limited to portions of the site least
visible to public view.
   (E)   Building design.
      (1)   Consideration should be given to height and scale of buildings so
that they are compatible with that of surrounding development. The height of
new buildings should transition from adjoining buildings to the maximum
building height of the new structure.
      (2)   Large buildings shall be designed to avoid the appearance of a box-
like structure. Methods to achieve this objective include:
         (a)   Vary the planes of the exterior walls. Walls should not run in
one direction for more than 50 feet without an offset.
         (b)   Vary the height of buildings so that they appear to be divided
into distinct massing elements.
         (c)   Articulate the different parts of a buildings exterior by use of
color and material changes, trim accents, window placement and other facade
elements.
         (d)   Use of landscaping, including climbing vines, can work to reduce
the bulky appearance of buildings.
         (e)   All building faces shall receive architectural treatment, not
just the street face of the building. Walls and roof lines should have varied
planes.
      (3)   (a)   Rooflines should not run in a continuous plane for more than
50 feet without offsetting or jogging the roof plane.
         (b)   All roof-mounted equipment shall be screened from public view by
materials similar to those used in the overall structure. Mechanical equipment
should be located below the highest vertical element of the building.
      (4)   Where appropriate, the use of awnings are encouraged. Awning color
and form should be consistent. Plexiglas, metal and glossy vinyl awning are
discouraged, while canvas, fabric, and matte finish vinyl awnings are
encouraged.
      (5)   The use of standardized corporate architectural styles associated
with chain restaurants and stores is discouraged. Effort should be made to
integrate the building design into the established architectural context of the
surrounding neighborhood and the city as a whole.
      (6)   Building color is an important part of the overall appearance of a
project. Much of the existing color in the city is derived from the primary
building’s finish materials such as brick, wood, stucco and terra cotta tile.
Also dominant are earth tones that match these natural materials. Recognizing
the importance of colors, the following standards for building color should be
observed:
         (a)   Where possible, the number of colors appearing on exterior walls
should be minimized. Most structures should use no more than three colors.
         (b)   Large areas of white should be avoided. The use of a subdued
dominating color is encouraged, however a bright trim color may be appropriate.
         (c)   Colors used on new buildings should be complementary to colors
used on surrounding existing development, unless surrounding buildings use
colors that strongly conflict with these standards.
   (F)   Signs. 
      (1)   New development should be designed with a precise concept for
signage, including provisions for sign placement, sign scale (in relationship
to the building) and sign readability.
      (2)   The design of individual signs should be integrated with building
architecture, in terms of materials, colors and texture.
      (3)   Monument-style signs are the preferred sign type for new
development, where possible. Monument scale signs are more in-scale with
motorist’s view.
      (4)   The use individually-cut letter signs, either internally or
externally lit is strongly encouraged.
   (G)   Lighting.
      (1)   Exterior lighting is encouraged to provide illumination for the
security and safety of on-site areas such as parking, loading, shipping and
receiving, pathways and other work areas.
      (2)   The design of light fixtures should be architecturally compatible
with on-site buildings.
      (3)   All light fixtures must be shielded to confine the spread of light
within the boundaries of the site, particularly where incompatible uses are
located in close proximity.
   (H)   Driveways.
      (1)   Driveways shall conform to city commercial driveway approach
standards.
      (2)   Entrance driveways for major shopping centers shall be setback 200
feet from major intersections.
      (3)   Entrance driveways for service stations, small commercial
properties or neighborhood shopping centers shall be setback 50 feet from
intersections.
      (4)   Service driveways, or private alleys, provided at the rear of
commercial buildings for delivery of goods shall have a minimum width of 30
feet. The City Engineer shall approve all service driveways or private alleys
located within 50 feet of a street intersection or other commercial driveway.
      (5)   All entrance driveways for major shopping centers which provide for
left and right turning movements on arterial street shall have a driveway
throat of 100 feet.

Section
   
10.76.010   Purpose.
   
10.76.020   Objectives.
   
10.76.030   Design guidelines.
§ 10.76.010   Purpose.
   The purpose of this chapter is to set forth design guidelines for industrial
development in Tulare that will work to achieve high standards of project
design. These regulations complement the standard site development regulations
listed in the individual zone district chapters. These design regulations are
general in nature and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their
application to specific projects. Issues addressed in this chapter include site
planning, parking and circulation, landscaping, walls, building design, signs
and lighting.
(1995 Code, § 10.76.010) (Ord. 2021-03, passed 11-2-2021; Ord. 00-1854, passed
- -2000)
§ 10.76.020   Objectives.
   (A)   To enhance the visual appearance of new development in the community;
   (B)   To promote energy conservation opportunities through increased shading
from trees and landscaping;
   (C)   To protect property values by maintaining high standards of property
development;
   (D)   To promote safe and efficient vehicle and pedestrian circulation; and
   (E)   To improve the safety and security of the residents and visitors of
Tulare.
(1995 Code, § 10.76.020) (Ord. 2021-03, passed 11-2-2021; Ord. 00-1854, passed
- -2000)
§ 10.76.030   Design guidelines.
   The following guidelines apply to all development occurring within the M
districts and are intended to facilitate high quality development that
complements the character of Tulare.
   (A)   Site design.
      (1)   A variety of building and parking lot setbacks should be provided
to avoid long, monotonous building facades and to create diversity.
      (2)   For industrial complexes that include multiple buildings (such as
an industrial campus) the placement of structures which creates opportunities
for plazas, courts or gardens is encourage. This generates visual interest that
is generally absent from square, featureless buildings. Setback areas may be
used to provide space for employee lunch/break areas.
      (3)   Where industrial uses are adjacent to non-industrial uses,
buffering techniques such as setbacks, screening and landscaping need to be
provided to reduce/eliminate any negative impacts of industrial operations.
   (B)   Parking and circulation. Important design considerations for parking
and circulation include, the location of ingress and egress points, on-site
pedestrian and vehicle traffic and circulation patterns and service functions.
The purpose is to ensure efficient circulation, safety and visual quality.
      (1)   Site access and internal circulation should be designed in a manner
which emphasizes safety and efficiency. Consideration should be given to the
separation of employee/customer parking and commercial vehicle operations
(trucking, delivery, etc.).
      (2)   Parking facilities should be designed so that vehicles can move
from one area to another on the same site without entering the street. This
will work to reduce on-street traffic.
      (3)   Addressing pedestrian movement in parking lots can improve safety
and make parking lots more visually appealing. Separate vehicle and pedestrian
circulation systems should be considered in the design of parking facilities.
Pedestrian linkages between buildings in multi-structure industrial
developments should be strongly emphasized. To improve vehicle circulation,
parking aisles should be aligned with vehicle circulation routes.
      (4)   To improve vehicle circulation, parking access to adjacent sites
and improve on-site circulation.
      (5)   Common driveways are encouraged to provide access to adjacent sites
and improve on-site circulation.
      (6)   Parking areas shall be generously landscaped to provide interior
and perimeter treatments.
      (7)   Parking driveways (access points) should be located as far as
possible from street intersections to avoid traffic problems. The number of
access points should be limited to the minimum amount necessary to provide
adequate circulation.
      (8)   Large parking lots should be divided into a series of connected
smaller lots, to the extent possible. Landscaping and offsetting portions of
the lot are effective in reducing the visual impact of large parking areas.
      (9)   Parking lots should be screened from adjoining streets by the use
of low earth berms, walls, landscaping or a combination of these methods.
      (10)   Industrial sites should be designed to accommodate all parking
needs generated by the use. The use of the public street for parking and
staging of trucks is not permitted.
      (11)   Parking lots shall be designed to accommodate solid waste pick-up
service without excessive backing-up of service trucks.
   (C)   Loading facilities.
      (1)   Loading facilities should be located out of sight of the public-of-
way, to the extent possible. Loading docks are most appropriately located at
the rear of buildings.
      (2)   Highly visible loading facilities should be screened from view
particularly if it is not possible to locate them at the rear of the building.
      (3)   Loading facilities should be located so that vehicles are not
required to use public streets backing into loading docks.
   (D)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Landscaping for industrial uses should be used to define specific
areas such as entrances to buildings and parking lots; define the edges of
various land uses, provide transition between neighboring properties and
provide screening for loading and equipment areas.
      (2)   Landscaping around the entire base of structures is recommended to
soften the edge between the parking lot and the building.
      (3)   Trees should be located throughout parking lots not simply at the
ends of aisles. This will achieve shading requirements and enhance the overall
appearance of parking facilities.
      (4)   Landscaping must be protected from vehicle encroachment by means of
raised planting areas, walls and curbs.
      (5)   Vines and climbing plants integrated on buildings, trellises and
perimeter garden walls are recommended, in order to soften the hard appearance
of long building walls.
   (E)   Walls and fences.
      (1)   Walls are often highly visible part of many projects and their
appearance can add or detract from the overall visual quality of a site. To the
extent possible, walls should be designed to blend with the overall
architectural character of the site, including material, color and texture.
Where possible, landscaping should be used to soften the appearance of walls.
      (2)   Where visible form the public right-of-way, walls should not be
blank, long surfaces, but rather should be articulated with intervening
pillars, alternating heights, offsetting sections and materials that provide
variety, including material texturing (as with plaster treatments).
      (3)   Screening fences for storage/ equipment/work areas should be
compatible with the overall site design. Chain link fencing with slats is
acceptable. Exterior storage should be limited to portions of the site least
visible to public view.
   (F)   Building design. As a category of structural types, industrial
buildings house a variety of uses, and as such, often present unattractive and
monotonous facades. However, there are a variety of design techniques that can
be utilized to promote visual variety and facilitate a cohesive, attractive
design statement:
      (1)   Avoid long, blank building facades, particularly on walls visible
form the public right-of-way. Facades with varied setbacks are encouraged. If
possible, wall planes should not run in one continuous direction for more than
50 feet without an offset.
      (2)   All elevations to a building should be architecturally treated to
avoid monotonous overall design.
      (3)   Window and doors are key elements of a structure's form and should
relate to the scale of the facade on which they appear. Windows and doors can
help establish character by their rhythm, spacing and variety. Recessed
openings further work to provide depth and contrast on elevation planes.
      (4)   Berming and associated landscaping can be used at the building edge
to reduce structure mass and height along facades.
      (5)   Metal buildings should be architecturally designed, providing
variety and visual interest to the streetscape.
      (6)   All roof-mounted equipment shall be screened from public view by
materials similar to those used in the overall structure. Mechanical equipment
should be located below the highest vertical element of the building.
      (7)   Design elements which are undesirable and should be avoided
include:
         (a)   Highly reflective surfaces;
         (b)   Large blank, unarticulated wall surfaces;
         (c)   Exposed, treated block walls;
         (d)   Poorly designed mansard roofs on a portion of the roofline; and
         (e)   Materials with high maintenance requirements, such as stained
wood or shingles.
   (G)   Signs.
      (1)   New development should be designed with a precise concept for
signage, including provisions for sign placement, sign scale (in relationship
to the building) and sign readability.
      (2)   The design of individual signs should be integrated with building
architecture, in terms of materials, colors and texture.
      (3)   Monument-style signs are the preferred sign type for new
development, where possible. This type of sign reduces visual clutter and is
more visible to the eye-level of motorists.
      (4)   The use of individually-cut letter signs, either internally or
externally lit is strongly encouraged.
   (H)   Lighting.
      (1)   Exterior lighting is encouraged to provide illumination for the
security and safety of on-site areas such as parking, loading, shipping and
receiving, pathways and other work areas.
      (2)   The design of light fixtures should be architecturally compatible
with on-site buildings.
      (3)   All light fixtures must be shielded to confine the spread of light
within the boundaries of the site, particularly where incompatible uses are
located in close proximity.
   (I)   Driveways.
      (1)   Driveways shall conform to city industrial driveway approach
standards.
      (2)   Driveways designed for heavy truck usage shall not exceed 60 feet
in width without approval from the City Engineer.
      (3)   Minimum separation between on-site driveways shall be 100 feet.
   (J)   Monitored electrified security fences.
      (1)   Definition. MONITORED ELECTRIFIED SECURITY FENCE means a perimeter
alarm system with an assembly of battery powered equipment, including but not
limited to: a monitored alarm device and energizer which is intended to
periodically deliver pulses to a security fence, a battery charging device used
exclusively to charge the system's battery, and other integrated components.
      (2)   The monitored perimeter security fence system shall transmit a
signal to an alarm monitoring business in response to an intrusion or burglary.
The system shall not directly connect to or call law enforcement. The business
must first verify the alarm event prior to requesting deployment of law
enforcement.
      (3)   The design, construction, and use of monitored electrified security
fences shall be allowed, subject to the following requirements:
         (a)   IEC Standard 60335-2-76. Unless otherwise specified herein,
Monitored Electrified Security Fences shall be constructed and operated in
conformance with the specifications set forth in International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) Standard No. 60335-2-76, current edition.
         (b)   Power source. The energizer for monitored electrified security
fences must be driven by a commercial storage battery not to exceed 12 volts
DC. The storage battery is charged by a solar panel.
         (c)   Perimeter barrier. Monitored electrified security fences shall
be installed behind a minimum five-foot high, maximum seven-foot high, non-
electrified perimeter barrier. On all new fencing the minimum of six-foot high
shall apply.
         (d)   Emergency gate access. Before a monitored perimeter security
fence is activated, a Knox device shall be approved by the Fire Department. The
Knox device will be installed at the main entry gate and fully functional at
all times when the monitored electrified security fence is operational.
         (e)   Setback. The monitored electrified security fence shall be
setback four inches to 12 inches from the non-electrified perimeter barrier.
         (f)   Height. Monitored electrified security fences shall be a minimum
of two feet above the non-electrified perimeter barrier, but in no event, more
than ten feet in height.
         (g)   Warning signs. Monitored electrified security fences shall be
clearly identified with warning signs that read: "Warning-Electric Fence" at
intervals of not less than 30 feet.
      (4)   It shall be unlawful for any person to install, maintain or operate
a monitored electrified security fence in violation of this chapter.

§ 10.92.010   Purposes.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide the City of Tulare with a
residential planning “tool” that can be used to promote residential development
that is designed differently than traditional residential development. The
residential development product that can be created through this combining
district is one that is more dense, flexibility in lot sizes, provides for the
construction of duplexes on corner lots, generates funds for neighborhood
parks, and is serviced by narrower streets. The Planned Residential Combining
District is designed to produce a comprehensive development that is equal to or
better than that resulting from residential development developed under more
traditional zoning regulations.
(1995 Code, § 10.92.010) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)
§ 10.92.020   Objectives.
   The objectives of this chapter are as follows:
   (A)   Allow for averaging of lot sizes to create greater flexibility in
subdivision design;
   (B)   Allow for greater flexibility in lot width and lot depth;
   (C)   Allow for the placement of duplexes on corner lots within single-
family residential developments;
   (D)   Provide for the integration of neighborhood parks; and
   (E)   Allow for different housing types and densities within the same zoning
district.

§ 10.92.030   District formation.
   (A)   To implement the objectives of this chapter, the Planned Residential
Combining District may be combined with any other single-family residential
zone district contained on the Official Zoning Map. Zone districts that are
combined with the Planned Residential Combining District shall be designated on
the Official Zoning Map with the base zone district followed by the Planned
Residential Combining District notation - (PD). For example, a single-family
zone that is combined with the Planned Residential district shall have the
notation R-1 (PD).
   (B)   The classification of property to the Planned Residential Combining
District shall be processed consistent with
Chapter 10.112, Zoning Ordinance Amendments. Any single-family residential zone
district contained in this chapter may be combined with the Planned Residential
Combining District.
(1995 Code, § 10.92.030) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)
§ 10.92.040   Permitted uses.

§ 10.92.060   Application.
   Applications to reclassify property to a planned residential combining
district, shall be processed consistent with
Chapter 10.112, Zoning Ordinance Amendments. The tentative subdivision map or
residential development plan that accompanies an application for
reclassification shall be reviewed by the Planning and Building Department to
determine consistency with the provisions of this chapter. The map or plan
shall include the following information:
   (A)   Legal description and boundary survey map of the exterior boundaries
of the parcel to be developed;
   (B)   Plot plan of land to be developed, showing residential uses by type,

development which is consistent with the intent of this district.
   (E)   Average lot size: the average lot size of a residential project under
the Planned Residential Zone District shall be that of the minimum lot size of
the base zone (e.g., the R-1-7 zone district has a minimum parcel size of 7,000
square feet therefore the average lot size shall be 7,000 square feet). Average
lot size shall be calculated by adding the square footage of all lots
designated for single-family use and dividing that number by the number of
single-family lots.
   (F)   Percentage of lots below minimum parcel size of base zone: the
percentage of lots designated for single-family homes that are below the
minimum lot size of the base zone shall not be more than 33% of the total lots
designated for single-family uses.
   (G)   Lot width: not more than 33% of the single-family residential lots
shall have a lot width less than the base zone standard.

paved width.
   (K)   Neighborhood subdivision parks: one lot of not less than average size
for every 20 lots within a subdivision shall be dedicated and improved as a
neighborhood park unless the Commission finds that a neighborhood park is not
necessary because of the location of a community park. Where the Commission
finds that a park is not necessary, an in lieu fee shall be paid. The amount of
the fee shall be determined by the City Engineer and shall be identified in a
subdivision or development agreement.
   (L)   Zero lot line standards:

removal or building permit for any historic resource, the city department or
agency receiving same shall, within five calendar days, notify the Secretary
and forward said permit application or proposal and accompanying documentation

authorization of the Commission. The Commission may approve non-substantial
alterations to the historic resource based on the application presented.
   (C)   Any application or proposal which proposes the substantial alteration
of an historic resource shall also be referred to the Secretary or his or her
designee for review.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on any
historic resource covered by this chapter that does not involve a change in
design, materials or external appearance.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Secretary
from issuing a building permit if he or she determines that demolition, removal
or substantial alteration of the historic resource is immediately necessary to
protect the public health, safety or general welfare.
   (F)    After consideration of all evidence and testimony, the Commission
shall have the authority to approve, deny or approve with modifications, any
application or proposal.
   (G)   No application or proposal shall be approved or approved with

      (1)   The proposed work is found to be consistent with the purposes of
this chapter and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards, not detrimental to
the special historical, architectural or aesthetic interest or value of the
historic resource; or
      (2)   The action proposed is necessary to correct an unsafe or dangerous
condition on the property; or
      (3)   Denial of the application will result in unreasonable economic
hardship to the owner. In order to approve the application, the Commission must
find facts and circumstances, not of the applicant's own making, which
establish that there are no feasible measures that can be taken that will
enable the property owner to make a reasonable economic beneficial use of the
property or derive a reasonable economic return from the property in its
current form; or
      (4)   The site is required for a public use which will directly benefit
the public health, safety and welfare and will be of more benefit to the public
than the historic resource.
      (5)   For applications for relocation of an historic resource, the
Commission shall find that one or more of the above conditions exist, that
relocation will not destroy the historical, architectural or aesthetic value of
the resource and that the relocation is part of a definitive series of actions
which will assure the preservation of the resource.
   (H)   Any finding that denial of the application or proposal will result
unreasonable economic hardship to the owner, pursuant to this section, may be
based on the following factors:
      (1)   An economic feasibility analysis conducted pursuant to this section
shall include the determination of an "after-rehabilitation" value of the
property calculated on an income approach utilizing the capitalization rate
determined appropriate by the city. This "after-rehabilitation" value shall be
determined in the following manner:
         (a)   The potential residential or commercial rental rate(s) which
could be generated by the property after an appropriate rehabilitation shall be
determined by a review of current market rates for comparable properties within
comparable neighborhoods.
         (b)   The potential annual net income that could be generated by the
property after an appropriate rehabilitation, taking into consideration
standard vacancy and expense factors, shall be determined.
         (c)   The appropriate capitalization rate shall be applied to the
potential annual net income to determine the "after-rehabilitation" value of
the property.
      (2)   The fair market value of the land, exclusive of improvements and
without development restrictions pursuant to this chapter, shall be determined
by a standard appraisal.
      (3)   The monetary cost of an appropriate rehabilitation of the resource,
in accordance with the standards of this chapter, shall be determined by
professionals qualified to make such a determination.
      (4)   If the fair market value of the land, combined with the costs of
rehabilitation, exceed the "after-rehabilitation" value of the property by more
than 20%, the Commission shall find that denial of the application will result
in an unreasonable economic hardship to the owner.
   (I)   If the Commission determines a permit should not be issued for the
demolition, alteration, relocation or new construction, or the Council on
appeal concurs, a new application affecting the same property may be submitted
during the 12-month period after the disapproval only if a substantial change
is made in the plans for the project.
   (J)   The Commission shall give written notice of the decision regarding the

§ 10.96.140   Historic district permit review process.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, association,
partnership or other legal entity to directly or indirectly alter, remodel,
demolish, grade, remove, construct, reconstruct or restore any property within
any historic district without first obtaining a city permit and written
approval of the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application or proposal for a demolition, grading,
removal or building permit for any property within any historic district, the
city department or agency receiving same shall, within five calendar days,
notify the Secretary and forward said permit application or proposal and
accompanying documentation to the Secretary and shall not process the permit or
proposal without the authorization of the Commission. The Commission may
approve non-substantial alterations to the property based on the application
presented.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on any
property covered by this chapter that does not involve a change in design,
materials or external appearance.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Planning
Director from issuing a building permit if it is determined that demolition,
removal or substantial alteration of a property within any historic district is
immediately necessary to protect the public health, safety or general welfare.
   (E)   After consideration of the final environmental document, all evidence
and testimony, the Commission shall have the authority to approve, deny or
approve with modifications, any proposed application or permit application.
   (F)   No application shall be approved with modifications unless the
Commission makes the following findings:
      (1)   For a contributor to any historic district, the proposed work is
found to be consistent with the general purposes of this chapter and the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards, not detrimental to the special
historical, architectural or aesthetic interest or value of the Contributor or
the respective historic district in general and consistent with the district's
adopted design standards; or
      (2)   For a non-contributor to any historic district, the proposed work
is found not detrimental to the historical or architectural values of the
respective historic district in general and consistent with the district's
adopted design standards; or
      (3)   For new in-fill construction within any historic district, the
proposed work is found not detrimental to the historical or architectural
values of the respective historic district in general and consistent with the
district's adopted design standards; or
      (4)   The action proposed is necessary to correct an unsafe or dangerous
condition on the property; or
      (5)   Denial of the application will result in unreasonable economic
hardship to the owner. In order to approve the application, the Commission must
find facts and circumstances, not of the applicant's own making, which
establish that there are no feasible measures that can be taken that will
enable the property owner to make a reasonable economic beneficial use of the
property or derive a reasonable economic return from the property in its
current form; or
      (6)   For applications for relocation of a contributor from any historic
district, the Commission shall find that one or more of the above conditions
exist, that relocation will not destroy the historical, architectural or
aesthetic value of the resource and that the relocation is part of a definitive
series of actions which will assure the preservation of the resource.
   (G)   Any finding that denial of the permit application will result in
unreasonable economic hardship to the owner, pursuant to division (F)(5) above,
may be based upon the application of the following factors:
      (1)   An economic feasibility analysis conducted pursuant to this section
shall include the determination of an "after-rehabilitation" value of the
property calculated on an income approach utilizing the capitalization rate
determined appropriate by the Development Services. This "after-rehabilitation"
value shall be determined in the following manner:
         (a)   The potential residential or commercial rental rate(s) which
could be generated by the property after an appropriate rehabilitation shall be
determined by a review of current market rates for comparable properties within
comparable neighborhoods.
         (b)   The potential annual net income that could be generated by the
property after an appropriate rehabilitation, taking into consideration
standard vacancy and expense factors, shall be determined.
         (c)   The appropriate capitalization rate shall be applied to the
potential annual net income to determine the "after-rehabilitation" value of
the property.
      (2)   The fair market value of the land, exclusive of improvements and
without development restrictions pursuant to this chapter, shall be determined
by a standard appraisal.
      (3)   The monetary cost of an appropriate rehabilitation of the resource,
in accordance with the standards of this chapter, shall be determined by
professionals qualified to make such a determination.
      (4)   If the fair market value of the land, combined with the costs of
rehabilitation, exceeds the "after-rehabilitation" value of the property by
more than 20%, the Commission shall find that denial of the application will
result in an unreasonable economic hardship to the owner.
   (H)   A decision relating to the approval with modifications or disapproval
of an application for any permit may be appealed pursuant to section §
10.96.160.
   (I)   If the Commission determines a permit should not be issued for the
demolition, alteration, relocation or new construction, or the City Council on
appeal concurs, a new application affecting the same property may be submitted
during the 12-month period after the disapproval only if a substantial change
is made in the plans for the project.
   (J)   The Secretary shall give written notice of the decision regarding the
regulated permit to the property owner/applicant. The notice shall contain the
Commission's findings in support thereof.

§ 10.100.060   Airport Combining District Zones.
   (A)   In order to carry the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain airport zones which include all of the land
lying within the Airport Combining District including, approach zones,
transitional zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. An area located in more
than one of the following zones is considered to be only the zone with more
restrictive height limitation.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or tree
shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limits
herein established for the zone. The applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each zone in question as follows:
      (1)   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and shall have a
width as specified on the Airport Zoning Map. The approach zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from
the primary surface at a slope upward 25 feet horizontally for each foot
vertically. The slope begins at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
      (2)   Heliport Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Approach Zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and shall
have a width as specified on the Airport Zoning Map. The approach zone expands
outward uniformly to a width of 500 feet at a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet
from the primary surface at a slope upward 25 feet horizontally for each foot
vertically. The slope begins at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
      (3)   Transitional Zones (LT). These zones are hereby established as the
area beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and
upward at 90-degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline
extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach zones, extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits
sloping upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach zones, and
extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision
instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, height limits
sloping upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically
shall be maintained beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as
precision instrument runway approach surface, and extending to horizontal
distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway
centerline.
      (4)   Heliport VFR Transitional Zones. These zones extend from the sides
of the primary surface and the approach zones a horizontal distance of 250 feet
from the primary surface centerline and the extended primary surface centerline
and slope upward and outward two feet horizontally for each foot vertically.
The slope begins at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surfaces and extends a distance of 250 feet measured
horizontally from 90-degree angles to the primary surface centerline and
extended centerline.
      (5)   Horizontal Zone (H). The horizontal zone is hereby established by
swinging arcs of radii specified on the Airport Zoning Map from the centerline
of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting to the
adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone
extends at an elevation of 150 feet above the airport elevation, however it
does not include the approach and transitional zones. The radius of each arc is
5,000 feet for all runways designated as utility or visual.
      (6)   Conical Zone (C). The conical zone is hereby established as the
area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward
there from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone slopes upward
and outward 25 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the
periphery of the horizontal zone and 150 feet above the airport elevation and
extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. The conical zone
does not include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional
zones.
      (7)   Primary Surface Zone (L). The elevation of any point on the primary
surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline. The width of a primary surface is 250 feet for utility runways
having only visual approaches.
      (8)   Approach Surface Zone (AA). An approach surface is applied to each
end of each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for
that runway end. The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as
the primary surface and it expands uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet for that
end of a utility runway with only visual approaches. The approach surface
extends for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet at a slope of 25 feet to one
for all utility and visual runways.

§ 10.104.010   Statutory authorization; findings of fact; statement of purpose.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of California
has in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local
government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of Tulare does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Tulare are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect
of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards that increase flood heights
and velocities also contribute to the flood loss.
   (C)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
(1995 Code, § 10.104.010) (Ord. 11-03, passed 4-19-2011; Ord. 00-1854, passed -
-2000)
§ 10.104.020   Methods of reducing losses.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(1995 Code, § 10.104.020) (Ord. 11-03, passed 4-19-2011; Ord. 00-1854, passed -

§ 10.104.030   Definitions.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure that is either:

use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ALLUVIAL FAN. A geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped
deposit of boulders, gravel and fine sediments that have been eroded from
mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley
floors, and  which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris
flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain
which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community (July 5, 1983).
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction  of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOOD WATER.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood- related erosion.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). The official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP. The official map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas
of flood hazards.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable
to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. An area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source. See FLOODING.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving  and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of
police power which control development in flood- prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures, and their contents. (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB
3-93 and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing.)
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
   FRAUD and VICTIMIZATION. As related to §
10.104.070 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause
fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the
Tulare City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed
building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the
community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed
below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased
risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the
community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and
suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners
may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is  located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The local governing unit, i.e. City of Tulare, that is
empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health,
safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HARDSHIP. As related to §
10.104.070 of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result
from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that
the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved.
Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience,
aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the
disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an
exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means
without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or
requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different
use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
   LEVEE. A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement, (See BASEMENT definition.)
      (1)   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor
that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   The wet floodproofing standard in §
10.104.060(A)(3)(c);
         (b)   The anchoring standards in §
10.104.060(A)(1);
         (c)   The construction materials and methods standards in §
10.104.060(A)(2);
         (d)   The standards for utilities in §
10.104.060(B).
      (2)   For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are
prohibited as they are considered to be basements. (See BASEMENT definition.)
This prohibition includes below grade garages and storage areas.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. Determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in
new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation
which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement
of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by
reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building
construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking
into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain Administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or
accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized
building cost estimating guides may be considered only if the factors are
included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and
supported by a written explanation of the differences.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum
(NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   MUDSLIDE. A condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid
mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush
cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a
period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA. An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, means structures for
which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of
floodplain management regulations adopted by this community (July 5, 1983), and
includes any subsequent improvements to the structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes  are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community (July 5,
1983).
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD or 100-YEAR FLOOD. See BASE FLOOD.
   PUBLIC SAFETY and NUISANCE. As related to §
10.104.070 of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not
result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire
community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully
obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable
lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this
is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its  noncompliance. Ways that impacts
may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development
from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   SHEET FLOW AREA. See AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). An area in the floodplain subject to a 1%
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM
as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99 or AH.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the
permit. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
PERMANENT CONSTRUCTION does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground;
this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or
other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains
of coastal or riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
(1995 Code, § 10.104.030) (Ord. 11-03, passed 4-19-2011; Ord. 00-1854, passed -
-2000)
§ 10.104.040   General provisions.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of Tulare.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) dated January 5, 1983, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated July 5, 1983, and all
subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the
minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which
are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study,
FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at 411 East Kern Avenue, Planning and Building
Department.
   (C)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the term
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent
the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.
   (D)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (E)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the City Council; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (F)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of City Council, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or
the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (G)   Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby
declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the
section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(1995 Code, § 10.104.040) (Ord. 11-03, passed 4-19-2011; Ord. 00-1854, passed -
-2000)
§ 10.104.050   Administration.
   (A)   Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of
special flood hazard established in §
10.104.040(B). Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be limited
to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.
Specifically, the following information is required.
      (1)   Site plan, including but not limited to:
         (a)   For all proposed structures, spot ground elevations at building
corners and 20-foot or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or
one-foot contour elevations throughout the building site;
         (b)   Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer, and
utilities;
         (c)   If available, the base flood elevation from the Flood Insurance
Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Map; and
         (d)   If applicable, the location of the regulatory floodway; and
      (2)   Foundation design detail, including but not limited to:
         (a)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement) of all structures;
         (b)   For a crawlspace foundation, location and total net area of
foundation openings as required in §
10.104.060(A)(3)(c) hereof and FEMA Technical Bulletins 1-93 and 7-93; and
         (c)   For foundations placed on fill, the location and height of fill,
and compaction requirements (compacted to 95% using the Standard Proctor Test
method); and
      (3)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed, as required in §
10.104.060(A)(3)(b) hereof and FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 3-93; and
      (4)   All appropriate certifications listed in §
10.104.050(C)(4) hereof; and
      (5)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   (B)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Planning and Building
Director is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter
by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.
   (C)   Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The
duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but
not be limited to the following.
      (1)   Permit review. Review all development permits to determine that:
         (a)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
         (b)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
         (c)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, ADVERSELY
AFFECTS means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   Review, use and development of other base flood data.
         (a)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in
accordance with §
10.104.040(B), the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer §
10.104.060. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for
adoption; or
         (b)   If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or
state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained
using one of two methods from the FEMA publication Managing Floodplain
Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing
Base (100-year) Flood Elevations dated July 1995 in order to administer §
10.104.060.
         (c)   Simplified method.
            1.   One hundred year or base flood discharge shall be obtained
using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey
publication, or the discharge drainage area method; and
            2.   Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-
2 computer program developed by FEMA; or
         (d)   Detailed method.
            1.   One hundred year or base flood discharge shall be obtained
using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ HEC-HMS computer program; and
            2.   Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers’ HEC-RAS computer program;
      (3)   Notification of other agencies. Alteration or relocation of a
watercourse:
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
         (c)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (4)   Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations.
         (a)   1.   Within six months of information becoming available or
project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall
submit or assure that the permit application submits technical or scientific
data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
            2.   All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the “start of construction” definition.
         (b)   Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of the
physical changes affecting flood conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements are based on current data.
      (5)   Changes in corporate boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever
the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and
include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate
limits.
      (6)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
         (a)   Certification required by §§
10.104.060(A)(3)(a) and
10.104.060(D) (lowest floor elevations);
         (b)   Certification required by §
10.104.060(A)(3)(b) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);
         (c)   Certification required by §
10.104.060(A)(3)(c) (wet floodproofing standard);
         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
10.104.060(C)(2) (subdivision standards); and
         (e)   Certification required by §
10.104.060(F)(1) (floodway encroachments).
      (7)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the
boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location
of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided herein.
      (8)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter
as specified in §
10.104.040(C).
   (D)   Appeals. The City Council of Tulare shall hear and decide appeals when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.

-2000)
§ 10.104.060   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
   (A)   Standards of construction. In all areas of special flood hazards the
following standards are required:
      (1)   Anchoring.
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy.
         (b)   All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of §
10.104.060(D).
      (2)   Construction materials and methods. All new construction and
substantial improvement shall be constructed:
         (a)   With flood resistant materials as specified in FEMA Technical
Bulletin TB 2-93, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
         (b)   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
         (c)   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding; and if
         (d)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (3)   Elevation and floodproofing. (See §
10.104.030, definitions for “basement,” “lowest floor,” “new construction,”
“substantial damage” and “substantial improvement”.)
         (a)   1.   Residential construction, new or substantial improvement,
shall have the lowest floor, including basement:
               A.   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to
a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM,
or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified. (The State of California recommends that in AO zones
without velocity the lowest floor be elevated above the highest adjacent grade
to a height exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at
least two feet, or elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade
if no depth number is specified.)
               B.   In an A zone, elevated to or above the base flood
elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods
in §
10.104.050(C)(2). (The State of California recommends the lowest floor be
elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by the
community.)
               C.   In AE, AH, and A1-30 Zones, elevated to or above the base
flood elevation. (The State of California recommends the lowest floor be
elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation.)
            2.   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the
lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
         (b)   Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement,
shall either be elevated to conform with §
10.104.060(A)(3)(a) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
            1.   Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under §
10.104.060(A)(3)(a) so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
            2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
            3.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the standards of this division are satisfied. The certification
shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
         (c)    All new construction and substantial improvement with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in
FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93 and TB 7-93, and must exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            1.   Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater; or
            2.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
         (d)   Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in §
10.104.060(D).
   (B)   Standards for utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
         (a)   Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
         (b)   Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
   (C)   Standards for subdivisions and other proposed development.
      (1)   All preliminary subdivision proposals or other developments greater
than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, shall:
         (a)   Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood
elevation (BFE).
         (b)   Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed
structures and pads on the final plans.
         (c)   If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the
following as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a
registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an
application for a Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) to the
Floodplain Administrator:
            1.   Lowest floor elevation.
            2.   Pad elevation.
            3.   Lowest adjacent grade.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (4)   All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes.
      (1)   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved,
within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, on
sites located:
         (a)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
         (b)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
         (c)   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
         (d)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site
upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result
of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation
(the State of California recommends at least two feet above the base flood
elevation) and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (2)   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30,
AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to
the provisions of §
10.104.060(D)(1) will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so
that either the:
         (a)   Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation (the State of California recommends at least two feet above the
base flood elevation); or
         (b)   Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
36 inches in height above grade.
         (c)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the
lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. The certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (E)   Standards for recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed
on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate
Map will either:
      (1)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use - a recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions; or
      (2)   Meet the permit requirements of §
10.104.050 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes
in §
10.104.060(D)(1).
   (F)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
10.104.040(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in [the base] flood elevation during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If §
10.104.060(F)(1) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this §
10.104.060.
(1995 Code, § 10.104.060) (Ord. 11-03, passed 4-18-2011; Ord. 00-1854, passed -
-2000)
§ 10.104.070   Variance procedures.
   (A)   Nature of variances.
      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (B)   Appeal Board.
      (1)   In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the:
         (a)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
         (c)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
         (d)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
         (e)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (f)   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (g)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
         (h)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
         (k)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
      (2)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   The construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Tulare County
Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (C)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of §§
10.104.070(C)(4) and
10.104.070(C)(5) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
“historic structures” (as defined in §
10.104.030 hereof) upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that  elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
         (a)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional “hardship” (as defined in §
10.104.030 hereof) to the applicant; and
         (c)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in §
10.104.030), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in §
10.104.030) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §§
10.104.060(C)(1) through
10.104.070(C)(5) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
      (7)   Upon consideration of the factors of §
10.104.070(B)(1) and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.

10.108.040   Development standards.
   
10.108.050   Design standards.
§ 10.108.010   Purposes.
   The purpose of the Downtown Commercial (D) District is to provide a
comprehensive set of development standards to be applied within Tulare’s
downtown area. These standards are provided for the continuance and enhancement
of the historic downtown area as the functional and symbolic center of Tulare.
(1995 Code, § 10.108.010) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)
§ 10.108.020   Objectives.
   The objectives of the D District are:
   (A)   Enhance efforts aimed at economic development by fostering an
environment conducive to business success in the downtown area;
   (B)   Generate pride and confidence in the downtown area;
   (C)   Create an attractive environment that is active throughout the day and
evening;
   (D)   Maintain a consistently high level of architectural design quality
that respects the historical context that has been established; and
   (E)   Encourage pedestrian activity by facilitating building design that
caters to and facilitates pedestrian shopping. Main building entrances should
face the street and parking lots should be placed to the rear or to the side of
buildings.
(1995 Code, § 10.108.020) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)
§ 10.108.030   Permitted and conditional uses.
   Permitted and conditionally permitted uses are the same as those permitted
in the C-3 Zone. See
Table 12-1 for a list of permitted and conditionally permitted uses in the C-
3 Zone.
(1995 Code, § 10.108.030) (Ord. 00-1854, passed - -2000)

buildings were constructed at the front of their lot. This allows pedestrians
to window-shop as they walk down the street. Parking lots are usually situated
to the rear or to the side of buildings, or are segregated from the site
entirely. To the extent practical, new construction shall follow this building
pattern, as follows:
      (1)   Front yard: buildings shall be designed so that at least one-half
of the parcel frontage shall abut a building wall.
      (2)   Side yard: no requirement, except that buildings located on corner
lots shall be designed so that at least one-half of the side lot-line abuts a
building wall.
      (3)   Rear yard: no requirement
   (E)   Plaza provisions:
      (1)   Minimum size: ten feet deep and the width of the entire storefront,
or an area incorporating at least 650 square feet.
      (2)   Paving: a minimum of 80% of the area shall be paved in a decorative
paver or textured, colored concrete. Asphalt paving is prohibited as a plaza
paving material.
      (3)   Landscaping: landscaping provided shall be consistent with the
requirements of
Chapter 10.196, Landscaping.
      (4)   Walls: walls up to 30 inches tall (which can be used for sitting)
may be located on the property line for restaurants or other uses utilizing the
plaza for retailing or other similar outdoor uses.
   (F)   Distance between structures: no requirement.
   (G)   Building height: 60 feet, maximum.
   (H)   Fences, walls and hedges:
      (1)   Maximum fence height in the Downtown Commercial district shall be
seven feet, except for walls constructed in pedestrian plazas.
      (2)   Materials and colors used for fences and walls shall be
complementary to the materials and colors used in buildings located on the
site.
   (I)   Off-street parking and loading facilities: off-street parking and
loading facilities shall be provided for each use as required in
Chapter 10.192, Parking and Loading. General parking lot design criteria are as
follows:
      (1)   Parking lots shall be located as much as possible to the rear of
buildings.
      (2)   Parking lots located between the front property line and the
primary entrance is prohibited.
      (3)   Parking lots constructed adjacent to any street right-of-way shall
be set back a minimum of five feet from the property line. The parking lot
shall be screened by minimum four-foot tall solid wall and landscaping.
   (J)   Signs: signs shall be designed consistent with the requirements
contained in
Chapter 10.188, Signs.
   (K)   Public improvements: new development may be required to install public
infrastructure necessary to adequately serve the project, based on requirements
of the City Engineer, including sewer, water, and storm drainage lines, curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, street paving, and street lighting. These improvements
shall be constructed consistent with requirements shown in the City of Tulare
Standards and Specifications Manual and shall be installed prior to occupancy
of any structures on the site.
   (L)   Traffic safety sight area:
      (1)   On corner lots, where the intersection consists of a state highway
and a designated arterial street, no fence, wall, hedge, sign or building,
shrubbery, mounds of earth or other visual obstruction over 36 inches in height
above the nearest street curb elevation shall be erected, placed, planted or
allowed to grow within the traffic safety sight area. The foregoing provision
shall not apply to public utility poles; trees trimmed (to the trunk) to a line
at least six feet above the level of the intersection; saplings or plant
species of open growth habits and not planted in the form of a hedge, which are
so planted and trimmed as to leave at all seasons a clear and unobstructed
cross view; supporting members of appurtenances to permanent buildings existing
on the date this title becomes effective; official warning signs or signals;
freestanding pole signs where the post does not not exceed 12 inches in
diameter and the bottom of the sign board is at least six feet above the level
of the intersection.
      (2)   In the downtown district, the following intersections consist of a
state highway and an arterial street:
         (a)   Inyo Avenue and “J” Street;
         (b)   Inyo Avenue and “M” Street;
         (c)   “M” Street and Kern Avenue;
         (d)   “M” Street and Tulare Avenue; and

§ 10.108.050   Design standards.
   (A)   Storefront construction. Ground-floor storefronts should have a
minimum of 60% transparent space (windows).
   (B)   Side walls. Blank, solid end walls or side walls visible from public
view are discouraged. If the walls are necessary (based on interior design),
the structure wall shall receive some form of articulation or “add-on” elements
such as awnings, cornice bands, murals, etc.
   (C)   Facade. The facade appearance of adjacent structures shall be
considered in the design of new buildings to avoid clashes in architectural
style and materials.
   (D)   Roofline. The roofline of buildings shall be considered as an
important element in the overall building design. Decorative embellishments at
the roofline such as cornices, or changes in height, material, color or shape
are encouraged.
   (E)   Canopies and awnings.
      (1)   Canopies and awnings shall respect the character and style of the
structure on which they are located, particularly in the material, color and
size.
      (2)   Canopies shall be sized so that they do not obscure significant
architectural features or cover transom windows above the canopy.
      (3)   The minimum clearance of a canopy or awning (including any attached
hanging signs) shall be eight feet from the lowest point to the sidewalk.
   (F)   Doors and windows.
      (1)   The design and location of doors and windows shall consider the
architectural character of the surrounding area. The use of simple wood and
glass doors and windows is encouraged. Where aluminum is used, a dark anodized
or baked enamel finish shall be used.
      (2)   Clear glass should be used on ground floor windows to promote
window shopping, visual displays and pedestrian activity. Tinted glass allowing
a minimum 50% light transmission will be considered only for use in second
floor windows and above on an individual case basis. The use of reflective
glass is prohibited.
      (3)   Storefront windows should be as large as possible while maintaining
height standards for bulkheads. Maximum bulkhead height for new construction
shall be 42 inches, and minimum bulkhead height shall be 24 inches. Bulkheads
should be accented with decorative tile, finished stone or other distinctive
material.
      (4)   Replacement windows must always fill the entire opening and
duplicate original patterns.
      (5)   Window patterns in new buildings shall respect existing window
patterns where a distinctive rhythm has been established.
   (G)   Lighting.
      (1)   All exterior lighting fixtures shall be designed as part of the
overall architectural theme. Fixtures, standards and all exposed accessories
shall be harmonious with the building design, the lighting design of adjacent
public spaces and the overall visual environment of the downtown.
      (2)   Night lighting of buildings shall be selective and focused;
exterior lighting of entire building faces is generally not desirable. Lighting
should highlight entrances, dramatize special architectural features, keynote
repeated features and use the play of light and shadow to articulate the
facade.
      (3)   Entrances of buildings and parking areas shall be well illuminated
to enhance safety, identification and convenience.
      (4)   Recessed building entry ways should be illuminated by down lights.

§ 10.109.070   Development standards.
   This section establishes development standards for uses in the MU district.
In the MU District, site development standards are used to encourage urban
development with pedestrian character. Site development standards include
minimum and maximum setbacks to create a street with vibrant pedestrian
environment, slow traffic down, provide a visually interesting character to the
street, and encourage walking. The setback standards encourage public spaces
between sidewalks and buildings entrances (e.g., extra-wide sidewalks, plazas,
squares, outdoor dining areas, and pocket parks).
   (A)   Minimum residential density.
      (1)   If housing is a part of a mixed-use development, dwellings are
permitted on and above the second floor of commercial uses with no minimum
density.
      (2)   Freestanding residential building density of 12 dwellings units per
residential acre.
   (B)   Maximum residential density. Ninety dwelling units per net residential
acre, either in freestanding residential buildings or in mixed use buildings on
and above the second floor.
   (C)   Lot size. No lot size restrictions.
   (D)   Minimum lot frontage. 18 feet.
   (E)   Maximum building footprint. 30,000 square feet, exclusive of any
parking structure.
   (F)   Setbacks.
      (1)   Minimum front yard.
 
Residential      5 feet
Mixed Use        None
Commercial/Other None
 
      (2)   Maximum front yard. 10 feet.

walls for attached residential or commercial development are proposed, or
existing buildings which are already constructed to property line.
   (G)   Building height.
 
Minimum 22 feet for new construction
Maximum 5 stories
 
   (H)   Building height transition. Development in the Mixed Use District
shall provide for a building height transition when adjacent to an existing
single-family residential zone district, to provide compatible scale and
privacy between developments. Buildings in the Mixed Use District, taller than
22 feet exclusive of any parapet walls, shall provide one foot of separation
from the single family zoned district for each foot of the building height.
   (I)   Off street parking and loading.
      (1)   One space per residential unit.
      (2)   One space per 300 square feet of gross floor area for commercial or
office uses.
      (3)   Institutional, assembly and restaurants uses shall provide parking
in accordance with
Chapter 10.192.
      (4)   Mixed Use buildings or sites are required to provide on-site
parking equal to 75%of the aggregate total of all required commercial, office
and residential parking. This 25% credit acknowledges sharing parking concepts
between commercial, office and residential uses.
      (5)   Parking areas shall conform to the standards as set forth in §
10.192.050.
      (6)   Loading facilities shall be provided in accordance with §

Commission.
(1995 Code, § 10.109.070) (Ord. 06-2004, passed 2- 21-2006)
§ 10.109.080   Design standards.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to require building and entrances to be
oriented to the street to the maximum extent practicable to encourage
pedestrian access and movement. Requirements for orientation and primary
entrances are intended to provide for convenient, direct and accessible
pedestrian circulation by connecting activities within a structure to the
adjacent sidewalk and to nearby transit stops; and promote the use of
pedestrian and transit modes of transportation to retail and commercial
facilities.
   (B)   The following design standards shall apply:
      (1)   All ground-floor tenant spaces with at least 25 feet of frontage
facing a public, or private streets shall have at least one building entrance
oriented to the adjacent street. Such an entrance shall open directly to the
outside and shall not require a pedestrian to first pass through a garage,
parking lot or loading area to gain access to the entrance from the street, but
the entrance may include architectural features such as arcades, anti-chambers,
porticos and the like without being in violation of this provision. If a
building has frontage on more than one street, the building shall provide a
main building entrance oriented to one of the streets or a single entrance to
the corner where the two streets intersect. Where one single tenant has 200
feet or more of frontage on public or private streets, one additional entrance
shall be provided for each 200 feet of frontage on one of the public or private
street. Freestanding banking institutions and restaurants located in the Mixed
Use district are exempt from the provisions contained in this division and may
locate the primary building entrance on any facade of the structure. A clear
internal site pedestrian sidewalk or pathway shall be provided to the building
entrance from all public or private street sidewalks. A building may have more
building entrances than required by this section oriented to a public or
private street, and may have secondary entrances facing off-street parking
areas and loading areas.
      (2)   Residential dwellings fronting on a public or private street shall
have a main entrance to the dwelling opening onto the front of the dwelling at
the ground floor lever. Such an entrance shall open directly to the outside and
shall not require passage through a garage to gain access to the doorway. The
doorway may be above final grade where a porch, stoop, portico, anti-chamber,
wheelchair ramp or similar architectural feature is included in the design.
Ground floor single-family attached housing or townhouse, condominium
residential units fronting on a public or private street shall have separate
entries directly from the major pedestrian route.
      (3)   Ground floor and upper story residential units in a multi-family
building fronting on a public or private street may share one or more entries
accessible directly from the street.
      (4)   Residential building facades over 150 feet in length facing a
street shall provide two or more main building entrances.
      (5)   Entryways into mixed-use buildings containing residential units
shall be clearly marked with a physical feature incorporated into the building
or an appropriately scaled element applied to the facade.
      (6)   Bicycle parking spaces shall be sited so as not to occupy space
within, reduce the size of, or impede the use of required sidewalks, pedestrian
ways, curbside landscape strips, landscape buffers or unable open spaces. All
bicycle parking must be easily accessible and shall be equipped or located so
as to allow the bicycle to be conveniently and securely locked to a parking
device or within a secured bicycle parking area. Covered bicycle parking shall
be provided. Covered bicycle parking may be provided within a parking
structure, garage, under a separate roof within a bicycle locker, or in a
designated area within a building or residential complex. A covered bicycle
structure may occupy two of the required on-site parking spaces.
      (7)   Surface parking areas shall provide perimeter parking lot
landscaping adjacent to a street which meets one of the following standards: a
five-foot wide planting strip between the right-of-way and the parking area
shall be provided for streets designate collector or local. A ten-foot wide
planting strip between the right-of-way and parking area shall be provided for
streets designated arterial.
(1995 Code, § 10.109.080) (Ord. 06-2004, passed 2-21-2006)
§ 10.109.090   Architectural standards.
   (A)   Ground floor windows and building facade requirements. Long expanses
of blank walls facing a street or other public areas detract from the
attractiveness to the streetscape and perceived safety of pedestrians using
those spaces. The standards of this division are intended to enhance street
safety and provide a comfortable street environment by providing ground-level
features of interest to pedestrians along streets. These standards also have
the purpose of encouraging surveillance opportunities where buildings face
abutting streets and public areas, preventing fortress-like facades, and
avoiding a monotonous pedestrian environment. These standards also help enhance
the economic vitality of a neighborhood by providing the opportunity for
merchants to display goods, and advertise their wares to shoppers. By
encouraging “window shopping” in Mixed Use Districts the activity on the street
is increased along with security. The following design standards shall apply:
      (1)   Mixed Use building with ground level commercial or office use shall
conform to the design standards in §
10.109.080.
      (2)   All development shall provide ground floor windows on the building
facade facing and adjacent to a public street, or facing onto a park, plaza or
other public outdoor space required windows shall provide a lower sill no more
than three feet above grade; except where interior floor levels prohibit such
placement, the sill may be located not less than two feet above the finished
floor level to a maximum sill height of five feet above exterior grade.
      (3)   Darkly tinted windows and mirrored windows which block two way
visibility are prohibited as ground floor windows required under this provision
except where the closest face of the building to the nearest edge of the
sidewalk within a public right-of-way or private street parallel and adjacent
to the building is greater than 50 feet.
      (4)   In all districts, building frontages along streets shall break any
flat, monolithic facade by including architectural elements such as bay
windows, recessed entrances or other articulation so as to provide pedestrian
scale to the first floor.
      (5)   Where ground floor windows are required by this section on public,
institutional office and commercial structures, exterior walls facing a public
street, public open space, pedestrian walkway and/or transit station shall have
window, display areas or doorways for at least 50% of the length and 50% of the
area of the ground level wall area, which is defined as the area to the
finished ceiling height of the fronting space or 15 feet above finished grade,
whichever is less.
   (B)   Building step-back requirements.
      (1)   Step-back requirements help assure a comfortable street environment
by preventing fortress-like facades, providing light and air at the street
level, and providing features of interest to pedestrians along streets in
mixed-use districts. The following design standards shall apply:
         (a)   Step-back requirements shall be achieved, at the option of the
applicant, by one of two methods:
            1.   Floors above the second floor shall be stepped back a minimum
of five feet for the first story above two, and additional five feet for floors
above three. The maximum step-back under this method shall not exceed 15 feet;
or
            2.   A building shall be stepped-back by an appropriate amount from
the plane of the street so as to maintain an angle not greater than 60 degrees
between the top of the building facade fronting on to the street and the back
of the sidewalk of the opposite side of the same street.
         (b)   Upon petition of the applicant, the Planning Commission may
waive the building step-back requirements of this section provided that the
applicant clearly demonstrates the proposed project:
            1.   Includes widow treatments, entry placement, facade relief and
other architectural treatments to provide visual interest and pedestrian-
sensitive design at the street level and to maintain a human scale in the
streetscape; and
            2.   Extends the same architectural features above the ground floor
level through variations in design, detail, and proportion, and by avoiding
designs featuring a monolithic street facade.
      (2)   Where step-back requirements are not required, the above design
standards shall be adhered to for multi-story buildings.
   (C)   Architectural design requirements. Good design results in buildings
visually compatible with one another and adjacent neighborhoods, contributing
to mixed use areas, which are attractive, stimulating, active and safe. The
following design requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Buildings shall promote and enhance a pedestrian scale and
orientation on the facade facing the public street. Street-side building
facades and dwelling units within all Mixed Use Districts shall be varied and
articulated to provide visual interest to pedestrians and avoid a flat
appearance. In addition, development proposals shall make provisions and
include designs consistent with the following:
         (a)   All new commercial, public/ institutional, mixed use, and
residential buildings constructed within a Mixed Use District shall demonstrate
that it promotes and enhances a pedestrian scale and orientation on any facade
facing a public or private street and it incorporates discernible and
architecturally appropriate features; such as, but not limited to, cornices,
bases, fenestration, fluted masonry, bays, recesses, arcades, display windows,
unique entry areas or other treatments for visual interest, to create community
character and to promote a sense of pedestrian scale. The design shall
recognize that the simple relief provided by window cutouts or sills on an
otherwise flat facade, in and of themselves, does not meet the requirements of
this section; and
         (b)   All residential dwellings, of any type, constructed within any
Mixed Use District shall be constructed with exterior building materials and
finishes of high quality to convey an impression of permanence durability.
Materials such as, and including masonry, stucco, stone, terra cotta, tile,
cedar shakes and shingles, beveled or ship-lap or other narrow-course
horizontal boards or siding, authentic vertical board and batten siding/
articulated architectural concrete masonry units (CMU), and similar durable
architectural materials are allowed. Materials such as and including, T-111
siding, plain or plain painted plywood and strandboard sheets, concrete or
cinder block, smooth surface concrete panels and similar quality and nondurable
material are prohibited.
      (2)   Commercial buildings and sites shall be organized to group the
utilitarian functions away from the public view. Delivery and loading
operations, HVAC equipment, trash compacting collection, and other utility and
service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building
(s) and the landscaping. The visual and acoustic impacts of these functions,
along with all wall-or ground-mounted mechanical, electrical and communications
equipment shall be out of view from adjacent properties and public streets, and
screening materials and landscape screens shall be architecturally with and not
inferior to the principal materials of the buildings and primary landscaping.
The visual and acoustic aspects of roof-mounted equipment behind parapets,
within architectural screening, roof-top screening and deadening the sound of
such equipment.
(1995 Code, § 10.109.080) (Ord. 06-2004, passed 2-21-2006)
§ 10.109.100   Maintenance of common areas.
   (A)   Property owner association, a landscape and lighting district or other
similar mechanism for the maintenance of common open space, private streets or
other improvements shall be set up as a condition of approval.
   (B)   All condominium projects shall comply with the requirements of
Chapter 10.146.
(1995 Code, § 10.109.100) (Ord. 06-2004, passed 2-21-2006)
§ 10.109.110   Variances.
   (A)   A variance may be granted to any development regulation or design
standard contained in this chapter provided the Planning Commission finds that
by granting the variance:
      (1)   The adjustment will equally or better meet the purposes of the
Mixed Use Districts and of the regulation to be modified;
      (2)   The variance or cumulative variance adjustments results in a
project which is still consistent with the overall purpose and intent of the
district;
   (B)   The Planning Commission may approve a variance from the architectural
standards if the project meets the following criteria.
      (1)   Multiple main building entrances required to be oriented to the
street. Variances may be granted to allow a single secured entrance to an
establishment upon a finding that the internal security measures, which are
standard operating procedures of the applicant would be irreparably harmed by
this requirement; except in no case shall there be less than one main entrance
oriented to a public or private street unless otherwise authorized by an
exception contained in this section.
      (2)   Ground floor windows. A variance to the percentage of window area
required for ground floor windows in buildings facades where required by this
section may be allowed upon findings that:
         (a)   Such windows would unavoidably compromise necessary personal
privacy or security within the building (for example, privacy in a clinic
examination room, security in a pharmacy storeroom, or security and privacy in
a research and development laboratory);
         (b)   Due to the design of the structure or other demonstrable
restrictions or constraints, the required personal privacy or security cannot
otherwise be provided; and
         (c)   The loss of the window area cannot be recaptured elsewhere on
the facade.

   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT. A single building containing more than one type of
land use or a single development of more than one building and use, where the
different types of land uses are in close proximity, planned as a unified
complementary whole, and functionally integrated to the use of shared vehicular
and pedestrian access and parking areas.
   SPECIAL USE PERMIT. A permit issued to establish conditions of approval for
an otherwise permitted or conditional use within a Mixed Use Overlay District.

public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to the property or improvements

10.144.070   Existing non-conforming accessory dwelling units.
§ 10.144.010   Purpose.
   The purpose of this chapter is to allow for accessory dwelling units on lots
developed with or proposed to be developed with single-family dwellings, and to
provide a process for accessory dwelling units consistent with Cal. Gov't Code
§ 65852.2.
(Ord. 19-05, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 10.144.020   Objective.
   The adopted policy of the city, as outlined in the goals and policies of the
Tulare General Plan, is to encourage a range of housing types, styles, and
costs to suit the varying needs and desires of the community. Accessory
dwelling units will allow homeowners a means of obtaining additional income
derived from tenants in accessory dwelling units, and would also allow for the
addition of inexpensive rental units to the housing stock of the city,
providing a valuable source of affordable housing for family members, students,
the elderly, in-home health care providers, the disabled, and others within
existing or proposed single-family dwelling units. Accessory dwelling units
provide much needed housing that is appropriate for a variety of stages in the
household life cycle, thereby lessening fluctuations in neighborhood demand,
while also protecting the stability, property values, and character of single-
family residential neighborhoods by ensuring that accessory dwelling units are
subject to the standards that follow.
(Ord. 19-05, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 10.144.030   Definition.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT. An accessory dwelling unit is either a detached or
attached dwelling unit which provides complete, independent living facilities
for one or more persons. It shall include permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the principal
dwelling unit. An accessory dwelling unit may also be an efficiency unit, as
defined in § 17958.1 of the Cal. Health and Safety Code, or a manufactured
home, as defined in § 18007 of the Cal. Health and Safety Code.
   LIVING AREA. The interior habitable area of a dwelling unit including
basements and attics but does not include a garage or any accessory structure.
   PRINCIPAL DWELLING UNIT. A single-family dwelling unit situated on a
residential lot to which an accessory dwelling unit as defined by this chapter
has been or is proposed to be added.
(Ord. 19-05, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 10.144.040   Application and fee.
   An application for an accessory dwelling unit shall be made to the Community
and Economic Development Department on a form prescribed by the Department. The
application shall be accompanied by a fee set by resolution of the City
Council.
(Ord. 19-05, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 10.144.050   Findings and approval process.
   The Community and Economic Development Department shall make the following
findings:
   (A)   That the location of the accessory dwelling unit and the conditions
under which it would be operated or maintained shall not be detrimental to the
public health and safety, nor be materially injurious to properties or
improvements immediately adjacent to the location of the accessory dwelling
unit;
   (B)   That the accessory dwelling unit shall comply with applicable
development standards contained in §
10.144.060 of this chapter; and

§ 10.145.010   Purpose.
   The city desires to allow for greater flexibility in housing style and
design. In order to accomplish housing variety, an ordinance providing for
townhouse or row housing development is enacted which provides for development
standards and guidelines. Townhouse development provides for increased density
in the range of eight to 12 units per acre. Increased density addresses
critical statewide issues such as housing affordability and resource land
protection by minimizing spread out development.
(1995 Code, § 10.145.010) (Ord. 05-1989, passed - -2005)
§ 10.145.020   Objectives.
   The objectives of townhouse developments are:
   (A)   The development of single-family residential housing units in a high-
density configuration utilizing common wall design;
   (B)   The development of single-family residential housing units in a high-
density configuration utilizing common wall design;
   (C)   Provide for attractive, well designed clusters of townhouse
development that exhibit a variety of architectural details with varying front
yard setbacks; and
   (D)   Address issues of affordability and provide for housing units to
address the needs of persons who do not wish a suburban style single-family
lot.

recreation, pedestrian access, or landscaping, but excluding parking
facilities, driveways, utility or service areas, or any required front or
street side yard, and excluding any space with a dimension of less than six
feet in any direction.
   OPEN SPACE, COMMON. An open space within a residential development reserved
for the exclusive use of residents of the development and their guests.
   OPEN SPACE, PRIVATE. A usable open space adjoining and directly accessible
to a dwelling unit, reserved for the exclusive use of residents of the dwelling
unit and their guests.
   TOWNHOUSE. Units shall be constructed up to common side lot lines without
side yards, and no windows, doors, or other openings, shall face a side lot
line except that the outside wall of end units may contain such openings.

townhouse, windows may be installed in the second-story or three-story wall of
the townhouse.
   TRAFFIC COURTYARD. A group of four to six dwelling units facing a courtyard.
COURTYARDS typically are developed in a “hammerhead” or cul-de-sac with
adequate dimensions to facilitate vehicles backing out from garages.

the application.
The following applications are required for a townhouse development:
   (A)   A conditional use permit application; and
   (B)   A zone amendment application to include a PD overlay, if the base zone
district is R-1-4, R-1-5 or R-1-6.
(1995 Code, § 10.145.040) (Ord. 05-1989, passed - -2005)
§ 10.145.050   Applicability.
   A townhouse development may be located in any R-M-3 or R-M-4 district
pursuant to securing a conditional use permit (
Chapter 10.116) or on any land zoned R-1-4, R-1-5 or R-1-6 by securing a zone
amendment to incorporate a PD overlay (
Chapter 10.92).
(1995 Code, § 10.145.050) (Ord. 05-1989, passed - -2005)
§ 10.145.060   Findings.
   The following findings shall be made for townhouse developments:

objectives of this chapter and the zone district in which the project is
located;
   (B)   That the proposed project will not be detrimental to the public
interest, health, safety or welfare or materially injurious to properties or
materials injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity;
   (C)   That the proposed project is consistent with the Tulare General Plan;
and
   (D)   That development of RM zoned properties to townhouse development will
not materially affect the supply of vacant land zoned for multi-family rental

CHAPTER 10.146: CONDOMINIUMS
Section
   
10.146.010   Purpose.
   
10.146.020   Objectives.
   
10.146.030   Definitions.
   
10.146.040   Applicability.

10.146.060   Condominium development policy, standards and criteria.
   
10.146.070   Condominium development standards.
   
10.146.080   Declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions.
   
10.146.090   Conversions of residential structures to condominiums.
§ 10.146.010   Purpose.
   Residential condominium projects require that householders, with vested
ownership in their respective dwelling units, live in close proximity to one
another. Condominium projects also require that such owners be bound together
in an association which is responsible for the maintenance, management, and
possible reconstruction of improvements within the common area of the project.
This mix of individual and common ownership is different from conventional and
familiar patterns of housing in the city. The unique status of residential
condominium projects tends to magnify the effects associated with higher urban
densities to the point where they may lead to conditions of mismanagement,
neglect and blight that impact upon the public health, safety, welfare and
economic prosperity of the larger community. To ensure that such problems are
avoided in both the short and long term, it is the express intent of the city
to encourage condominium projects by establishing reasonable regulations for
the development of such projects. The expressed purpose of this chapter is to
regulate “air space” condominiums, including conversions.
(1995 Code, § 10.146.010) (Ord. 05-1990, passed 11-15-2005)
§ 10.146.020   Objectives.
   (A)   To ensure that condominium ownership is bound together by appropriate
conditions, covenants and restrictions (C.C. & R’s).
   (B)   To establish reasonable procedures for the dissolution of the
condominium and demolition of the structures at the end of their economic,
functional or physical life and thus obviate conditions of residential
obsoleteness and blight and their detrimental effects upon both immediate
occupants and the larger community;
   (C)   To ensure that the project developer provides adequate private outdoor
living space, storage space and parking space to meet the expectations and
changing needs of property owners over a long period of time;
   (D)   To ensure that the project developer is attentive to the performance
characteristics of the structure and mitigates such problems as vibration and
noise transmission which may be apparent to the buyer without living in the
unit but which, if not adequately attenuated, may nevertheless render the
living environment within the project undesirable and the transfer of unit
ownership difficult;
   (E)   To ensure that the project developer uses contemporary and
environmentally sensitive concepts of site planning and architectural design in
the creation of the project and to ensure that the project, once completed,
maintains its integrity over time.

§ 10.146.040   Applicability.
   A condominium development may be located in any R-M District pursuant to
securing a conditional use permit (
Chapter 10.116) or on any land zoned R-1-4, R-1-5 or R-1-6 by securing a zone
amendment to incorporate a PD Overlay (

   A condominium project shall conform to the following density.
   (A)   Maximum eight units to the acre if located in an R-1 Zone District.
   (B)   Maximum eighteen units to the acre, if located in an R-M-2, R-M-3, or

§ 10.146.060   Condominium development policy, standards and criteria.
   (A)   To achieve the purpose of this section, all proposals for condominium
usage made pursuant to the provisions of this section, including the conversion
of existing residential structures to condominiums, shall conform to the
condominium development standards provided for in this section. Additionally
the Commission shall review the project proposal in order to determine its
degree of compliance with both the condominium development standards and
development criteria delineated in §§
10.146.070 and
10.146.080 of this chapter. A condominium proposal which does not comply with
all of the precise development standards in this chapter may be approved where
the Commission finds that there are unusual circumstances regarding the
development’s location, site or configuration, that the project is in
substantial compliance with both the development standards and development
criteria, and that there are mitigating features incorporated in the project
which tend to further the expressed intent and purposes of this section.
   (B)   Recognizing that the conversion of existing multiple residential
structures to condominium usage presents unique problems with respect to the
requirements of this section, the City Planning Commission is empowered to vary
any and all requirements contained herein with regard to a particular
conversion proposal upon a finding that the creation of the proposed
condominium will not have the potential to contravene the intent and purpose of
this chapter. Project characteristics of critical importance in determining
whether or not a proposed conversion has that potential include the age of the
structure and the degree to which the proposal varies from the required
standards for the following:
      (1)   Parking;
      (2)   Minimum unit size is 800 square feet;
      (3)   Sound transmission characteristics;
      (4)   Private open space; and
      (5)   Storage space.
   (C)   The City Planning Commission is also empowered to impose conditions on
its approval of the site plan which would require that specified modifications,
designed to bring a structure more nearly into compliance with the condominium
development standards contained herein, be made to the structure proposed for
conversion.
(1995 Code, § 10.146.060) (Ord. 05-1990, passed 11-15-2005)
§ 10.146.070   Condominium Development Standards.
   To achieve the purpose of this section, the City Planning Commission shall
require, except as noted above, that all condominium projects conform to all
ordinances of the city and all of the following condominium development
standards:
   (A)   Private open space. Notwithstanding the minimum total amount of usable
open space required for a project and the required minimum dwelling unit size,
in projects which include five units or more, all of the units shall have an
appurtenant private patio, deck, balcony, atrium, or solarium with a minimum
area of 200 square feet, except that one-bedroom units shall have a minimum
area of 150 square feet. Such space shall have a configuration that would allow
a horizontal rectangle or square of 100 square feet in area and a minimum
dimension of seven feet to be placed in the space. Additionally, such space
shall be at the same level as and immediately accessible from either a kitchen,
dining room, family room, master bedroom, or living room within the unit. The
City Planning Commission may evaluate such project on its own merits, for the
purpose of determining the number of bedrooms and with regard to the type,
configuration and characteristics of the development including condominium unit
mix, and may allow variations from the above dimensional standards where it can
be shown that the required private open space meets the intent and purpose of
this section.
   (B)   Private storage space. Each unit within the project shall have at
least 400 cubic feet of enclosed, weatherproofed and lockable storage space for
this sole use of the unit owner. Such space shall have a minimum horizontal
surface area of 50 square feet, a minimum interior dimension of five feet, and
an opening not less than three feet by six feet, a minimum interior dimension
of five feet, and an opening not less than three feet by six feet. Such space
may be provided within individual storage lockers, cabinets or closets in any
location approved by the City Planning Commission, but shall not be split along
two or more locations. Moreover, since it is the intention of this standard to
require space over and above that normally associated with day-to-day
functioning of the unit, the City Planning Commission shall exercise reasonable
discretion in differentiating between such required private storage space and
guest, linen, clothes closets, or food pantries that are customarily within the
unit. Thus, while providing such private storage space within the limits of the
unit is not precluded, it shall be over and above that which would otherwise be
provided within the unit.
   (C)   Off-street parking spaces.
      (1)   Spaces assigned to units. There shall be at least two covered
parking spaces assigned to each condominium unit within the project.
      (2)   Spaces designated for visitors. In addition to the above
requirements, there shall be at least one visitor parking space for each five
condominium units within the project. A fractional requirement equal to, or
greater than, one-half of a visitor parking space shall be interpreted as a
requirement for a total visitor parking space. Where buffer and other physical
conditions are conducive to street parking without impeding traffic or creating
undesirable safety conditions, parallel on street parking at the curb may be
determined by the City Planning Commission to be appropriate visitor parking.
   (D)   Walls.
      (1)   A 36-inch-high concrete, masonry, or decorative block wall shall be
provided and maintained on the outside perimeter of all off-street parking
areas abutting or visible from a public street except at points of ingress and
egress for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. In lieu of the 36-inch-high screen
wall, land contouring and landscaping equivalent to 36 inches in height, or a
combination of wall and land contouring, may be provided if approved by the
Planning Department.
      (2)   A six-seven foot-high solid concrete masonry wall shall be provided
and maintained on the boundary of any condominium project (except front yard),
unless the Commission finds that a block wall is unnecessary or undesirable.
      (3)   All walls shall be architecturally compatible to main buildings.
Type, texture, and color shall be approved by the Planning Department.
   (E)   Treatment of utilities. Services and systems shall comply with all
building department codes and regulations. Separate utilities are normally
required by the City Engineer.
   (F)   Attenuation of noise - general. All proposed condominium projects and
conversions shall comply with all city and State of California thermal and
noise insulation requirements
   (G)   Underground utilities. All utilities shall be underground in
accordance herewith.
   (H)   Refuse storage. All common outdoor trash, garbage, and refuse areas
shall be screened on all sides from public view by a decorative concrete block
or masonry wall and the opening provided with a gate of durable wood or
comparable material. Such area shall be so located as to be easily accessible
for trash pickup. The Department shall approve type, texture and color.
   (I)   Lighting. All lighting of the building, landscaping, parking area, or
similar facilities shall be hooded and directed to reflect away from adjoining
properties.
   (J)   Mechanical equipment. All ground mechanical equipment shall be
completely screened if visible from a public street. All wall air conditioner
units shall be screened from view with material that is compatible and in
harmony with the architectural styling and detailing of the building.
   (K)   Clothes-drying areas. All clothes-drying areas shall be screened on
all sides by a fence or wall not less than six feet high.
   (L)   Development on lots of parcels with existing structures. No
condominium development shall take place on a lot portion parcel on which
another type of land use structure is located until such structure is removed.
   (M)   Signs. Only the following signs, subject to the following conditions,
are authorized:
      (1)   One nameplate per unit, not exceeding one square foot in area,
containing the name and address of the occupant of the premises, unless the
Fire Marshall requires larger address;
      (2)   One interior lighted or unlighted sign attached to a main building,
of no more than two square feet per dwelling unit, up to a maximum of twenty
square feet, at a major entrance which faces a street;
      (3)   One interior lighted or unlighted sign attached to a main building,
not to exceed 15 square feet of surface area, pertaining only to the sale,
lease, or rental of the particular building, property or premises upon which
displayed;
      (4)   All attached signs shall be flat against the building or structure
and shall not extend above the top of the wall; must be constructed of metal,
or comparable fireproof material; and shall be enclosed and bird and vermin-
proof;
      (5)   Unimproved property shall be permitted one freestanding “for sale,”
“lease,” or “rent” sign not to exceed six feet in height and 15 square feet per
face.
   (N)   Height limitation. Condominium structures shall be limited to four
stories in height, excluding subterranean levels devoted to automobile parking.
   (O)   Maintenance of standards. All improvements in the condominium project
shall be continuously maintained in a neat, orderly, and healthy condition. The
improvements shall include, but not be limited to signs, landscaping, off-
street parking, storage areas and walls.
   (P)   Building code conformance. All common walls and ceiling/floor systems
shall be fireproof and soundproof and must conform to current building
standards adopted by the city. Also, condominiums shall provide for a four-hour
fire rated construction between units.
   (Q)   Building elevations. All building elevations and colors shall be
approved by the Planning Commission. The Commission may require elevations to
vary to avoid repetitive design.
   (R)   Private streets. Private streets maybe allowed 36 feet curb to curb
and a six-foot adjacent sidewalk for a total right-of-way of 48 feet.
   (S)   Common wall construction or separation.  Condominium units shall
either have common wall construction or have the following separation:
      (1)   Ten feet between adjacent single-story units or a single and a two-
story unit;
      (2)   Twelve feet between adjacent two story units; or
      (3)   Fifteen feet if three story or greater are proposed between the
next adjacent unit or structure.
   (T)   Requirement of architectural designs. The Commission may require a
minimum of three distinct architectural designs for larger developments.

   To achieve the purpose of this section, the declaration of covenants,
conditions and restrictions relating to the management of the common area an
facilities shall accompany all proposals for condominium usage made pursuant to
the provisions of this section. In addition to such covenants, conditions, and
restrictions that may be required by the Department of Real Estate and the
State of California or pursuant to Cal. Civil Title 6, Part IV, Division II or
other state laws or policies, such declaration shall provide for the following,
none of which, after acceptance in final form by the city, shall be amended,
modified or changed without first obtaining the written consent of the city.
   (A)   Assignment of conveyance of private open space. The surface area and
appurtenant airspace of private open space areas, including but not limited to
the private patio, deck, balcony, solarium, or atrium required by §
10.146.070(A) of this chapter, and any integral potion of that space that may
exceed the minimum area requirements, shall be described and irrevocably
assigned to its respective unit except that where the private open space is
totally within the boundary described by the interior surfaces of the unit, it
shall be conveyed as an integral part of the unit.
   (B)   Assignment or conveyance of private storage areas. The surfaces and
appurtenant airspace of private storage areas, including but not limited to the
private storage space required by §
10.146.070(A) of this chapter shall be described and irrevocably assigned in
the declaration or condominium plan to its respective unit, except that where
the private storage space is totally within the boundary described by the
interior surfaces of the unit, as it would be in a closet opening upon a unit’s
room or hallway, it shall be conveyed as an integral part of the unit.
   (C)   Assignment of conveyance and use of required off-street parking
spaces. Required off-street enclosed parking spaces, except guest parking
spaces, shall be permanently and irrevocably assigned to particular units
within the project on the basis of two spaces per unit, except that where two
parking spaces are totally within the boundary described by the interior
surfaces of the unit, as they would be in a townhouse development with a
private entrance from the parking garage to the unit, it shall be conveyed as
an integral part of the unit. To the maximum practicable extent the two spaces
assigned to each unit shall be contiguous. In no case shall the private storage
area of one unit overhang or take its access form the required off-street
parking space of another unit. All parking spaces shall be used solely by unit
owners, members of their families, their guests or lessees of the owners’ unit,
except that a unit occupant within the project may rent one space to another
unit occupant or to the association. All parking spaces shall be used solely
for the purpose of parking motor vehicles as defined by the Vehicle Code of the

   (F)   Voting. For the purpose of voting, including without limitation voting
to set the amount of regular or special assessments and for the purpose of
amending the covenants, conditions, and restrictions, one vote shall be
allocated for each unit within the project, provided, however that:
      (1)   Except as proved with respect to the developer of a project herein
below, no owner shall be entitled to vote, directly or indirectly, more than
ten percent of the total number of units in the project or a maximum of ten
units whichever is the lesser; provided further, that where there are less than
ten units in a project, the maximum voting power shall be one unit.
      (2)   Division (F)(1) above, shall not apply to voting by the developer
of a project, provided that the declaration shall provide for all of the
following:
         (a)   Voting by classes, one class being the developer and the other
being all of the other owners;
         (b)   Wherever a particular percentage vote is required, the

project for partition thereon by sale of the entire project as if the owners of
all of the condominiums in which project were tenants uncommon in the entire
project in the same proportion as their interests in the common areas;
provided, however, that a partition shall be made only upon a showing of the
existence of one or more of the conditions set forth in Cal. Civil Code § 1354,
or that:
         (a)   Two years after damage or destruction to the project which
renders a material part thereof unfit for its use, the project has not been
rebuilt or repaired substantially to its state prior to its damage or
destruction; or
         (b)   One-half or more of the project has been destroyed or
substantially damaged and condominium owners holding in aggregate more than 50%
interest in the common areas are opposed to repair or restoration of the
project;
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, multiple owners of a single unit
shall not be deemed possessed, in the aggregate, of any greater interest in the
common areas than that possessed by a single owner of a unit.
   (H)   Maintenance. The declaration shall contain a provision establishing
the obligation and duty of the governing body of the condominium to maintain
the common areas in good conditions.
   (I)   Enforcement. The declaration shall contain a provision insuring the
right of any owner to enforce the terms of the declaration.
   (J)   Assessments for maintenance of common areas and facilities.

footage of each unit within the project. Both annual and special assessments
may be collected on a monthly basis. The remedies which the association may
bring for the nonpayment of assessments shall be specified and may include
penalties for late payment.
      (2)   Veto right and authority of the city. In consideration for the
city’s approval of a condominium project, including without limitation any
approval of a conversion to condominium usage, the declaration shall provide
that the city at its option has the right and authority to veto any action of
the association which would tend to decrease the amount of the regular annual
assessment upon a finding by the city that such a decrease could or would
adversely affect the long-run maintenance of the condominium structure and/or
its common areas. To enable the city to exercises said optional veto, the
declaration shall provide that association actions to decrease the annual
assessment do not become effective until 60 days after written notice of such
action is given to the city.
   (K)   Utility easements over private streets and other areas. If the
condominium project contains private streets, provision shall be made for
public utility easements over the entire private street network. The City
Planning Commission may also require public utility easements adjacent to
public streets or over other portions of the project to accommodate fire
hydrants, water meters shall be limited to the sale and/or supply of motor
fuels and oils, to the sale of lines an similar urban infrastructure. The City
Planning Commission may also require access routes necessary to assure that

prior to its adoption by the owners;
      (2)   Either the city has approved the amendment or failed to disapprove
it within the 30-day period; and
      (3)   The recorded instrument effecting such amendment shall recite that
it was so submitted and approved or not disapproved.

§ 10.146.090   Conversions of Residential Structures to Condominiums.
   Any proposal to convert existing apartments to condominiums shall be subject
to the approval of a site plan and the filing and approval of a subdivision map
pursuant to the requirements of
Chapter 8.24 (Subdivision Regulations) of the Tulare Municipal Code. No
conversion may be approved without a finding that such conversion will not
negatively impact rental housing in the city. For the purposes of making this
finding, the conversion of more than 20 units in any calendar year constitutes
a negative impact on the rental housing in the city unless evidence is
submitted showing that the vacancy rate is such to justify a greater number of
conversions.

         (b)   Increased bonus. The increase identified in Table 3-6 above
shall be in addition to any increase in density required by divisions (A)(1)
through (A)(4), up to a maximum combined mandated density increase of 35% if an
applicant seeks both the increase required in compliance with this division (A)
(5), as well as the bonuses provided by divisions (A)(1) through (A)(4).
         (c)   Eligibility for increased bonus. An applicant shall be eligible
for the increased density bonus provided by this division if all of the
following conditions are met:
            1.   The applicant donates and transfers the land no later than the
date of approval of the final map, parcel map, or residential development
application.
            2.   The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land
being transferred are sufficient to allow construction of units affordable to
very low income households in an amount not less than 10% of the number of
residential units of the proposed development.
            3.   The transferred land is at least one acre in size, or of
sufficient size to allow development of at least 40 units; has the appropriate
Land Use Plan designation; is appropriately zoned for development as affordable
housing; and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and
infrastructure. The land shall have appropriate zoning and development
standards to make the development of the affordable units feasible.
            4.   No later than the date of approval of the final map, parcel
map, or of the residential development, the transferred land shall have all of
the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the
development of the very low income housing units on the transferred land,
except that the city may subject the proposed development to subsequent site
plan review to the extent authorized by Cal. Gov’t Code § 65583.2(i) if the
site plan and associated details have not been reviewed by the city before the
time of transfer.
            5.   The transferred land and the affordable units shall be subject
to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent
with §
10.148.070 (Continued availability), which shall be recorded on the property at
the time of dedication.
            6.   The land is transferred to the city or to a housing developer
approved by the city. The city may require the applicant to identify and
transfer the land to the approved housing developer.
            7.   The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the
proposed development or, if the city agrees, within one-quarter mile of the
boundary of the proposed development.
   (B)   Greater or lesser bonuses. The city may choose to grant a density
bonus greater than provided by this section for a development that meets the
requirements of this section, or grant a proportionately lower density bonus
than required by this section for a development that does not fully comply with
the requirements of this section.
   (C)   Density bonus calculations. The calculation of a density bonus in
compliance with this section that results in fractional units shall be rounded
up to the next whole number, as required by state law. For the purpose of
calculating a density bonus, the residential units do not have to be based upon
individual subdivision maps or parcels.
   (D)   Requirements for amendments or discretionary approval. The granting of
a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a
General Plan amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary approval.
   (E)   Location of bonus units. The developer may locate density bonus units
in the housing project in areas other than where the units for the lower income
households are located.

      (1)   An applicant for a density bonus in compliance with this chapter
may submit to the city a proposal for the specific incentives or concessions
listed in division (C) (Type of incentives), below, that the applicant requests
in compliance with this section, and may request a meeting with the Director.
The applicant may file a request either before filing an application for city
approval of a proposed project or concurrently with an application for project
approval. The review authority shall grant an incentive or concession request
that complies with this section unless the review authority makes either of the
following findings in writing, based upon substantial evidence:
         (a)   The incentive or concession is not required to provide for
affordable housing costs, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as
specified in Cal. Health and Safety Code § 50052.5.
         (b)   The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse
impact, as defined in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and
safety or the physical environment, or on any real property listed in the
California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without
rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.
      (2)   The applicant shall show that a waiver or modification of
development standards is necessary to make the housing units economically
feasible.
   (B)   Number of incentives. The applicant shall receive the following number
of incentives or concessions.
      (1)   One incentive or concession. One incentive or concession for a
project that includes at least 10% of the total units for lower income
households, at least 5% for very low income households, or at least 10% for
persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.
      (2)   Two incentives or concessions. Two incentives or concessions for a
project that includes at least 20% of the total units for lower income
households, at least 10% for very low income households, or at least 20% for
persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.
      (3)   Three incentives or concessions. Three incentives or concessions
for a project that includes at least 30% of the total units for lower income
households, at least 15% for very low income households, or at least 30% for
persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.
   (C)   Type of incentives. For the purposes of this chapter, concession or
incentive means any of the following:
      (1)   A reduction in the site development standards of this title (e.g.,
site coverage limitations, setbacks, reduced parcel sizes, and/or parking
requirements) (see also § 10.148.050 [Parking requirements in density bonus
projects]), or a modification of architectural design requirements that exceed
the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards
Commission in compliance with Cal. Health and Safety Code §§ 18901 et seq.,
that would otherwise be required, that results in identifiable, financially
sufficient, and actual cost reductions;
      (2)   Approval of mixed-use land uses not otherwise allowed by this title
in conjunction with the housing development, if nonresidential land uses will
reduce the cost of the housing development, and the nonresidential land uses
are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development
in the area where the project will be located; and/or
      (3)   Other regulatory incentives proposed by the applicant or the city
that will result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost
reductions.
   (D)   Effect of incentive or concession. The granting of a concession or
incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan
amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary approval.

application for a permit and/or license is submitted after a permit and/or
license has expired or has been revoked.

§ 10.180.010   Purposes.
   The primary purpose of this chapter is to apply reasonable standards for the
outside sale of food and merchandise and to protect pedestrian and vehicle
circulation. In addition, standards based on the health, safety, and welfare of
the general public are significant issues to be addressed in the issuance of a
vending permit. Access to and use of the public sidewalks for vending and
selling of merchandise, which does not unduly interfere with the pedestrian
traffic, promotes the public interest by contributing to an attractive
pedestrian environment and increased sales activities within the City of
Tulare. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the lawful operation of itinerant
vending when associated with special civic events such as the County Fair and
downtown events such as a farmers market.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.020   Definitions.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
meaning as set forth herein below:
   CITY BUSINESS LICENSE. Means a business license as is required by Tulare
Municipal Code Chapter 5.04.070. Sidewalk vendors are required to obtain both a
business license and a sidewalk vendor permit to operate.
   PERMITTED SPECIAL EVENT. An event, whether annual or one-time, that has an
approved special event permit issued by the office of the City Clerk, or
granted approval by the Director of Community Services or Director of Community
and Economic Development. Such events can include, but are not limited to
downtown civic events, and events held at the Tulare County Fairgrounds, or
International Agri-Center.
   PRIVATE SIDEWALKS or PRIVATE YARDS. Refers to private property suitable for
stationary vending stands which is not encumbered by parking spaces, driveways,
vehicular pathways, landscape areas and building sites.
   PUBLIC SIDEWALK. Shall mean area or properties owned or held by the City of
Tulare that are open to the general public for pedestrian travel.
   ROAMING SIDEWALK VENDOR. Means a sidewalk vendor who moves from place to
place and stops only to complete a transaction. A roaming sidewalk vendor does
not include a peddler or solicitor that makes uninvited entry onto private
property for the purpose of selling goods or services or requesting/collecting
donations.
   SIDEWALK VENDOR. Means a person who sells food or merchandise from a
pushcart, stand, display, pedal driven cart, wagon, showcase, rack, or other
nonmotorized conveyance, or from one's person, upon a public sidewalk or other
pedestrian path. As described in this chapter, sidewalk vendors can be
classified as roaming vendors or stationary vendors.
   SIDEWALK VENDOR PERMIT. Means the permit issued by the City of Tulare under
this chapter and required for a sidewalk vendor to operate within the city
limits. This type of permit is not the same permit required for door-to-door
peddlers/solicitors that are permitted/licensed under separate provisions of
the Tulare Municipal Code, nor the same type of permit for stationary mobile
vendors, which require a conditional use permit. Sidewalk vendors are required
to obtain both a City of Tulare business license and a sidewalk vendor permit
to operate. For stationary sidewalk vendors the permit shall describe the
specific site location used by the stationary sidewalk vendor, what the
stationary sidewalk vendor will be placing in the public right-of-way, the area
the stationary sidewalk vendor is required to keep free from debris and trash,
and an acknowledgment by the stationary sidewalk vendor that they are subject
to closure if the city requires the use of the space for a municipal purpose.
   SPECIAL EVENT. Means a parade, march, procession, pageant, review, ceremony,
festival, assembly, or exhibition consisting of persons, animals, or vehicles,
or a combination thereof which is conducted in, or would impact, any portion of
any city street, sidewalk, alley, or other public right-of-way, or other
property owned or controlled by the city that required or involved the issuance
of a permit for such usage by the city.
   STATIONARY CART/VENDOR STAND. Means equipment used for vending which has no
motorized wheels and is not otherwise mobile once it has been transported and
is set in a location for vending. This includes any table, bench, rack, hand
cart, or push cart. The term stationary does not include trailers that are
pulled by a motorized vehicle and licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles;
this type of equipment shall be considered a stationary mobile vendor.
   STATIONARY MOBILE VENDOR. As used in this chapter means soliciting,
displaying, or offering produce, fruits, vegetables, prepared food, pre-
packaged food or non-food sundries of any kind for sale or barter or exchange
from a mobile vending  vehicle on private property within the City of Tulare
and includes the standing of a mobile vending vehicle or trailer for the
purpose of obtaining or soliciting retail sales of produce, fruits, vegetables,
prepared food, pre-packaged food or non-food sundries, including but not
limited to goods, wares, or merchandise.
   STATIONARY SIDEWALK VENDOR. Means a sidewalk vendor who vends from a fixed
location. This does not include restaurants or businesses at fixed locations
that, pursuant to applicable rules and regulations for food safety and right-
of-way encroachment, set up temporary outdoor sales at their locations.
   VENDOR. Shall mean an individual, including any employee or agent of a group
of individuals, partnership, non-profit organization, or corporation, who sells
or offers to sell food, beverages, goods or merchandise from a stationary
vendor stand on any public sidewalk or private sidewalk open to the public.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.030   Permit required.
   It shall be unlawful, and no vendor shall offer for sale, or sell from any
stationary vendor stand located on a public sidewalk, park, or private
sidewalk/yard open to public use, or from their person if they are a roaming
sidewalk vendor, any merchandise, food or beverage without first obtaining a
sidewalk vendor stand permit in addition to a city business license, and in the
case of a stationary mobile vendor, a conditional use permit. If a vendor
intends to sell food, the vendor must obtain all applicable licenses required
to safely sell and serve food as required by state and local law.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.040   Vending on private property.
   Vending on private sidewalks or yards shall be permitted, subject to the
limitations of this chapter and subject to the submittal to the Community and
Economic Development Department of written authorization by the property owner.
Vending shall not be allowed on any required parking spaces or required
landscaping and may not interfere with the safe movement of pedestrians and
motor vehicles.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.050   Sidewalk vending requirements.
   The following requirements apply to both stationary and roaming sidewalk
vendors:
   (A)   Sidewalk vending is prohibited within 1,000 feet from any special
event that is operating pursuant to a permit issued by the City of Tulare. This
prohibition shall only be in effect during the duration of the special event
permit and does not apply to sidewalk vendors that are selling food or
merchandise with the permission of the special event applicant and are
specified as part of the special event permit. The special event applicant must
provide the city with the locations of the stationary sidewalk vendors and the
routes of roaming sidewalk vendors that will be permitted by the special event
applicant prior to the issuance of a special event permit. Roaming sidewalk
vendors during special events must carry a copy of the permission from the
special event applicant with them at all times during the special event.
   (B)   Sidewalk vending is prohibited within 1,000 feet from the exterior
boundary of any property used or occupied by any high school, middle school, or
elementary school for the period of one hour before the school is in session,
while the school is in session, and one hour after the school day ends. This
provision does not apply if the vendor is present at the invitation of the
school.
   (C)   Sidewalk vending on trails or parkways that are operated by the City
of Tulare for pedestrian/bicycle usage is prohibited in order to ensure the
public's use and enjoyment of the natural resources and recreational
opportunities provided by these trails. In addition, prohibiting sidewalk
vending on these trails would ensure that the health, safety, and welfare of
the general public using the trails is not compromised due to obstruction and
interference of sidewalk vendors with walking, jogging, and cycling activities
on these active use trails.
   (D)   Recognizing that many nonprofit recreational leagues operate
concession stands as primary fundraising for such leagues, which provide
recreational opportunities to the public, sidewalk vendors, roaming or
stationary, are prohibited within 1,000 feet of any events put on by nonprofit
recreational leagues that are operating concession stands as fundraising
sources.
   (E)   Sidewalk vendors must, at all times during operations on a public
sidewalk or pedestrian path, maintain a minimum width of five feet of
unobstructed sidewalk for pedestrian traffic and must also meet all other
requirements for pedestrian travel that are required pursuant to the Americans
with Disabilities Act or other access standards for persons with disabilities.
In places where the sidewalk is less than five feet wide, sidewalk vending
stands shall be not less than four consecutive feet of sidewalk width to every
point from said stationary vendor stand which is clear and unimpeded for
pedestrian traffic. Sidewalk vendors may not be located within five feet of any
pedestrian ramps, driveways, and trash cans within the public right-of-way,
drinking fountains, push buttons for traffic signals, or other right-of-way
element that requires pedestrian access. If lines of customers block or
interfere with any pedestrian ramps, driveways, trash cans within the public
right-of-way, drinking fountains, push buttons for traffic signals, bus stops,
or other right-of-way element that requires pedestrian access, then the
sidewalk vendor must relocate to another sidewalk location to avoid such
interference. This rule is to provide adequate space for disability access
within the public right-of-way. This rule shall not apply to roaming sidewalk
vendors making a sale to a bona fide purchaser during the allotted time period,
although the vendor shall make all reasonable efforts to comply with requests
from pedestrians to move out of the way as soon as possible and not obstruct
the sidewalk. Failure by a sidewalk vendor to move or cease business when they
are not providing the minimum width of unobstructed sidewalk for pedestrian
traffic shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. In areas where the street
contains striped diagonal or vertical parking stalls (not including spaces that
are parallel with a sidewalk), sidewalk vendors must maintain a minimum width
of five feet of unobstructed sidewalk from the curb to allow for persons or
passengers exiting or entering the vehicles parked in such stalls sufficient
space for directly accessing the sidewalk from the vehicle and not be required
to travel in the street to reach the sidewalk.
   (F)   Sidewalk vending is prohibited within ten feet from entrances of
businesses and bus stops to prevent obstructing access and to allow pedestrians
adequate space in the public right-of-way to reach destinations.
   (G)   The City Council may, by resolution adopted during a public meeting,
prohibit sidewalk vending in specific areas within the city limits upon a
finding that sidewalk vending should be prohibited in such area due to health,
safety, or welfare concerns. Such findings may include, but are not limited to,
situations involving areas with both substantial vehicle traffic and
substantial pedestrian traffic in locations presenting risks of pedestrians
improperly crossing streets or entering the street when sidewalks are blocked.
If any such resolutions are adopted, then the locations of prohibited vending
shall be indicated and provided to sidewalk vendor permit applicants.
   (H)   Sidewalk vendors must maintain sanitary conditions and carry a trash
container so customers can deposit waste from sold merchandise or wrappers.
   (I)   Hours of sidewalk vending shall be the same as other businesses that
are operating in the vending area. For sidewalk vendors operating in a park,
then the hours shall be the same hours of operation as the park.
   (J)   Sidewalk vendors are prohibited from operating within streets,
medians, crosswalks (although roaming vendors may cross in such areas as other
pedestrians) or other areas that are marked closed to pedestrian traffic.
   (K)   If any type of food or beverage is displayed and/or sold from a
stationary vendor stand, the vendor shall have and prominently display any and
all valid permits required by the Tulare County Health Department. The revision
or expiration of any such required County Health Department permit, or the
failure to obtain such a permit within 90 days of the date on which the county
commences issuing such permits, shall result in the automatic suspension of the
sidewalk vendor permit or use permit issued by the city pursuant to this
chapter; in addition, the approved permit must be readily available for
inspection by law enforcement or code enforcement officials.
   (L)   The sidewalk vendor permit issued by the city shall be prominently
affixed to the side of the stationary vendor stand which faces inward toward
the sidewalk.
   (M)   No vendor shall use any signs in connection with the sale, display or
offering for sale of items, except for those signs which are affixed to or
painted on the sides or canopy of the stationary vendor stand and one sandwich
sign, located on private property, not exceeding four square feet per sign
face.
   (N)   No vendor shall use any noise making device in connection with the
sale, display or offering for sale of items.
   (O)   Sidewalk vendors are subject to all other applicable rules,
regulations, and ordinances.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.060   Specific requirements for roaming sidewalk vendors.
   In addition to the rules applicable to all sidewalk vendors, the following
rules shall specifically apply to roaming sidewalk vendors:
   (A)   Roaming sidewalk vendors shall remain mobile and may not stand or park
at any specific location or place for more than ten minutes, unless the vendor
is otherwise stopped as necessary to complete a transaction(s) at the request
of a bona fide purchaser(s) that approached the roaming vendor while stopped.
   (B)   Roaming sidewalk vendors are not permitted to knock on doors of homes
or businesses to vend under a sidewalk vendor permit. Such attempts at peddling
or soliciting shall be considered door-to-door sales and require a separate
type of permit under the Tulare Municipal Code §
5.24.
   (C)   Sidewalk vendor permits issued by the City of Tulare only allow for
vending on publicly owned right-of-ways, as limited by this chapter. Roaming
sidewalk vendors are not permitted on private property without the permission
of the property owner and must meet all underlying zoning requirements to
operate on private property.
   (D)   Roaming sidewalk vendors are permitted in areas zoned exclusively for
residential use, but hours of operations are limited to between the hours of 9:
00 a.m. and one hour prior to sunset or 7:00 p.m., whichever is earlier.
   (E)   In order to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of pedestrians,
mobile carts used by roaming sidewalk vendors are not permitted to be utilized
as a cook top for food preparation when the food being prepared requires the
cooking or heating of food in order for it to be consumed.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.070   Specific requirements for stationary sidewalk vendors and
stationary mobile vendors.
   In addition to the rules applicable to all sidewalk vendors in §
10.180.050, the following rules shall specifically apply to stationary sidewalk
vendors and stationary mobile vendors:
   (A)   All stationary vendor stands and stationary mobile vending units shall
have refuse receptacles large enough to contain all refuse generated by the
operation. The operator shall pick up all refuse generated by such operation
within a 50-foot radius at the close of the day's operation and all refuse
shall be disposed of at an approved solid waste facility.
   (B)   No vehicle or stationary vendor stand used for stationary sidewalk
vending or stationary mobile vending shall remain on public property during
non-operating hours. Overnight parking of mobile vending vehicles on a public
street, alley, or private property that does not meet the definition of a
commissary in accordance with the California Retail Food Code (Cal. Code) is
prohibited. Hours of operation for all stationary vendor stands or stationary
mobile vending shall be limited to the hours of operation of the business
located on the property from which they operate.
   (C)   Vending shall not be allowed on any required parking spaces or private
driveways.
   (D)   Vendors shall not remove, destroy or interfere with any required on-
site landscaping.
   (E)   Vending may only occur on paved surfaces.
   (F)   For stationary mobile vendors, restroom facilities with running water
and which are connected to the city's wastewater system shall be readily
available during hours of operation.
   (G)   Stationary mobile vendors shall maintain 500 feet of separation
between businesses possessing an on-sale ABC license.
   (H)   Stationary mobile vendors shall maintain 300 feet of separation
between an adjacent stationary mobile vendor.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.080   Permit process.
   (A)   Stationary sidewalk vendors. Applicants for a sidewalk vendor permit
shall submit a written application to the Community and Economic Development
Director on a city form. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, based
on the costs of the application and set by the City Council in resolution. All
sidewalk vendor applicants must submit the sidewalk vendor permit application,
copies of insurance certificates, listing the City of Tulare as additional
insured that meet the same insurance requirements for encroachment permits to
operate within the City of Tulare public right-of-way. The vendor encroachment
permit is part of the vendor permit issued to sidewalk vendors and is not a
separate permit, and shall include a proposed site plan showing the planned
location and what will be utilized by the stationary vendor in the public
right-of-way as the stationary cart/stand. The city may reject stationary
vendor site plans that do not allow adequate space for pedestrian access.
Stationary sidewalk vendors must acknowledge that they are not permitted to
permanently install anything within the public right-of-way and that they do
not have permanent rights to utilize public property and are subject to
temporary or permanent closure if the city requires the use of the right-of-way
for a municipal purpose, which includes but is not limited to usage of the
space by persons holding valid rights under franchises, or if another permitted
use, other than another sidewalk vendor, requires the space on a temporary
basis. Any stationary vendor seeking to utilize park property will also be
subject to review by the Parks and Recreation Director, or that person's
designee. Vendor permit applications on park property are subject to denial if
the proposed location would interfere with the public's use and enjoyment of
natural resources or recreational opportunities, such as blocking equipment,
sports fields, or walkways. Vendor permit applications on park property may
also be denied if necessary to prevent an undue concentration of commercial
activity that unreasonably interferes with the scenic and natural character of
the park, including negatively impacting the public welfare of park users. The
Community and Economic Development Director, or his or her designee and the
City Engineer, or his or her designee, shall review the application and the
proposed site plan prior to issuance and may require modifications of specific
site proposals to meet objective health, safety, or public welfare concerns. A
permit shall be granted if it is determined that: the proposed display and sale
and proposed location will not significantly interfere with the pedestrian
traffic or otherwise constitute a health and safety risk.
   (B)   Stationary mobile vending. Where a person desires to have a stationary
mobile vending unit, the applicant shall obtain a conditional use permit
pursuant to Tulare Municipal Code
Chapter 10.116.
   (C)   Roaming sidewalk vendor. In addition to the permit process applicable
to stationary sidewalk vendors in §
10.180.080(A), applicants intending to be roaming sidewalk vendors shall
include the proposed areas of the city that the vendor intends to operate
within. Roaming sidewalk vendors are not permitted on private property without
the written permission of the property owner. Roaming vendors seeking to
utilize park property will also be subject to review by the Parks and
Recreation Director or that person's designee, and vending in certain parks or
park locations may be denied or restricted, including limiting the total number
of roaming vendors allowed in a specific park, if necessary to prevent an undue
concentration of commercial activity that unreasonably interferes with the
scenic and natural character of the park, including negatively impacting the
public welfare of park users.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.090   Special limitations.
   Sidewalk vendor permits are an interruptible or terminable privilege. The
city shall have the right and power, through the City Manager or his or her
designee, to prohibit the operation of a stationary vendor stand at any time
because of anticipated or actual problems or conflicts in the use of a public
area. Such problems and conflicts may arise from, but are not limited to,
scheduled festivals and similar events, or parades or marches, or repairs to
the street or sidewalk, or from demonstrations or emergencies occurring in the
area.
   No sidewalk vendor permits shall be issued for any location: 1) owned by the
city other than the pedestrian right-of-way; or 2) the area east of the Union
Pacific Railroad, west of O Street, north of (and including) Inyo Avenue and
south of (and including) the parcels north of Cross Avenue due to an increased
and significant risk of pedestrian and vehicular traffic conflicts in order to
preserve public health, safety and welfare.
   This shall not apply to any city-approved events in these areas or to
businesses which have obtained a permit under Title 10, Chapter 184.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019; Ord. 2022-05, passed 4-27-2022)
§ 10.180.100   Insurance or bond requirements.
   No permit shall be issued unless the applicant furnishes proof to the city
of a public liability bond or insurance policy in an amount not less than
$1,000,000 for property damages and injury, including injury resulting in
death, caused by the operation of the vending business. Said insurance bond
shall name the City of Tulare, its employees, officers, and agents as
additional insureds.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.110   Permit revocation.
   A sidewalk vendor permit may be revoked by the City Council, following
written notice to the permittee, if one or more of the conditions of the permit
or of this chapter have been violated or if the stationary sidewalk vendor
stand is being operated in a manner which constitutes a nuisance, or unduly
impedes or restricts the movements of pedestrians. Following revocation, the
former permit holder shall not be eligible to file for a new permit application
for a period of six months.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.120   Appeal process.
   An applicant or any other interested party may appeal the granting, denial,
or revocation of a permit application. Such an appeal may be made, in writing,
within ten days of the decision and shall be filled with the City Council. The
Council shall hold a public hearing on any such appeal.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.130   Term.
   A sidewalk vendor permit is valid for a period of one year from the date of
issuance and must be renewed every year. Where a conditional use permit is
issued, such permit may be time limited to require renewal.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.140   Enforcement.
   The Community and Economic Development Director, or his or her designee, or
any other person authorized by the City Manager, shall be authorized to enforce
the provisions of this chapter and to take such actions as may be necessary to
ensure compliance with the regulations, general provisions and conditions
opposed upon any permit issued pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.150   Penalty.
   Violations of this chapter are not punishable as an infraction or
misdemeanor and persons alleged to violate this chapter shall not be subject to
arrest. This section does not prevent code enforcement personnel from taking
immediate action, such as seizing items, to abate unsafe and dangerous
conditions to the public, which include but are not limited to vendors selling
food without proper licensing, and subject to enforcement pursuant to §
1.61.030 (Administrative Citation).
(Ord. 19-07, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 10.180.160   Severance clause.
   The provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable and if any
section, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter shall for any reason be
held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decisions shall not affect the
validity of the remaining sections, sentences, clauses, and phrases of this
chapter, but they shall remain in effect, it being the legislative intent that
this chapter shall stay and notwithstanding the validity of any part.

§ 10.184.010 Purposes.
   The purposes of the regulations and standards in this chapter are to allow,
consistent with public health, safety and welfare, increased business and
pedestrian traffic by providing safe and visually appealing opportunities for
outside display and sales of merchandise, in conjunction with an existing,
enclosed commercial business activity, in public rights-of-way and private
sidewalk areas open to the public, in the City of Tulare. Nothing in this title
shall prevent the lawful operation of itinerant sidewalk sales.
(1995 Code, § 10.184.010) (Ord. 10-03, passed 2-16-2010; Ord. 00-1854, passed -
-2000; Ord. 2022-05, passed 4-27-2022)
§ 10.184.020 Definitions.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   OUTSIDE DISPLAY AND SALE OF MERCHANDISE. The use of immediately adjacent
sidewalks either public or private, open for public use,  and public rights-of-
way by an existing, enclosed commercial business establishment for the display
and sale of merchandise.
(1995 Code, § 10.184.020) (Ord. 10-03, passed 2-16-2010; Ord. 00-1854, passed -

§ 10.184.030 Permit required.
   No outside display and sale of merchandise shall be allowed on sidewalks and
public rights-of-way without an outside display and sales permit as set forth
in this chapter.

volume or proximity of vehicular traffic is not compatible with such activity
or any other element of public safety, health or welfare. All outside display
and sale of merchandise areas must be adjacent to and incidental to the
operation of an indoor, enclosed commercial business. Use of the sidewalk must
be confined to the actual sidewalk and public right-of-way frontage of the
indoor commercial business building and must be clearly delineated from
adjacent business and pedestrian traffic, utilizing sidewalk striping or other

§ 10.188.020   Objectives.
   (A)   Signs have an obvious impact on the character and quality of the city.
As a prominent part of the scenery, they attract or repel the viewing public,
affect the safety of vehicular traffic, and sets the tone of the neighborhood.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter include the following.
   (C)   Signs have an obvious impact on the character and quality of the city.
As a prominent part of the scenery, they attract or repel the viewing public,
affect the safety of vehicular traffic, and sets the tone of the neighborhood.

establishment or to direct attention to a project, activity, place, person,
organization or enterprise;

of the building and the neighborhood and to enhance the economic effectiveness
of signs;

* = dimensions for two-way circulation system
Notes:
1.   Accessible parking stalls and accessible routes shall comply with
current CBC and ADA standards.
2.   The figures in the table above correspond to the dimensions shown in
the parking diagram above. For example "W" in the table corresponds to
the width of an individual parking space. The table shows that for lots
with 90-degree, 45-degree, and 60-degree parking, this measurement is
nine feet. As another example, dimension "D" is the aisle width. For a
parking lot with 60-degree angle parking and one-way circulation, this
measurement is 12.0 feet, minimum.
3.   When wheel stops are required for 90° parking stalls, "L" = 20.0
feet.
 
   (B)   Circulation. Parking lots shall be designed so that backing onto a
public street is avoided. This standard does not apply to single-family
dwelling units or duplexes.
   (C)   Paving, slope and drainage. All parking lots and driveways shall be
surfaced with a minimum thickness of two inches of asphalt concrete, concrete
or other material acceptable to the City Engineer, over a minimum thickness of
four inches of an aggregate base material. Parking lots shall be designed to
facilitate proper drainage and shall not drain over any sidewalk or adjacent
property.
   (D)   Curbing and wheel stops. Concrete curbing at least six inches tall and
six inches wide shall be provided around all perimeter areas and around all
landscape areas to define the edges of the parking lot and to protect
landscaping. Wheel stops are required to protect walkways when a vehicle
overhang of two feet would result in less that 48 inches of clear path of
travel on adjacent sidewalks, or when required to protect structures or
adjacent facilities.
   (E)   Striping. Parking spaces shall be clearly marked with paint striping a
minimum of four inches in width. Other markings and signage shall be provided
to show circulation patterns. All paint striping shall be maintained by the
property owner.
   (F)   Lighting. Parking areas shall have lighting capable of providing
adequate illumination for security and safety. Lighting standards shall be in
scale with the height and use of the structure. Lighting shall be installed so
as not to cause a nuisance to adjoining properties. Off-site illumination shall
be limited to 0.5 foot candles where adjacent property is residential.
   (G)   Driveways for commercial/industrial/ multiple family residential uses.
      (1)   Minimum width.
         (a)   One-way circulation: 15 feet.
         (b)   Two-way circulation: 25 feet.
      (2)   Location. The location of driveways to and from the public right-
of-way shall be determined by the Planning and Building Director. For corner
lots, driveways shall be no closer than five feet to the street radius. (See
commercial district design standards for specific driveways locations for
commercial properties, §
10.60.020(H)).
   (H)   Landscaping. All parking lots shall be landscaped in accordance with
the requirements contained in
Chapter 10.196, Landscaping.
   (I)   Parking lot location. Parking lots shall be located on the same site
or within 300 feet of the business to which the parking pertains except for
uses in the Downtown Commercial (D) district.
   (J)   Shared on-site parking reduction. Where two or more non-residential
uses share a single parking lot, the total number of parking spaces may be
reduced by the Planning Commission in accordance with the following schedule:
      (1)   A 5% reduction in the total number of parking spaces where the
building square footage exceeds 50,000.
      (2)   A 10% reduction in the total number of parking spaces where the
building square footage exceeds 100,000.
      (3)   A 15% reduction in the total number of parking spaces where the
building square footage exceed 150,000.
      (4)   A 20% reduction in the total number of parking spaces where the
building square footage exceeds 200,000.
      (5)   Reductions greater than 20% are prohibited unless a variance is
approved pursuant to Chapter 10.128, Variances.
   (K)   Shared off-site parking agreement. Where two nearby uses have distinct
and differing peak parking demands (for example, a use that operates only
during the day and a use that operates only at night) or where it can be
demonstrated that one site has an excess supply of parking spaces that will not
be used in the foreseeable future, the required number of parking spaces may be
reduced through minor deviation, provided that the parking lots of each use are
located within 300 feet of each other (as measured along the most direct
pedestrian path). The amount of reduction may be up to 75% of the amount of
spaces required for the most intensive of the two uses sharing the parking.
   (L)   Planning and Building Director modification. Parking space
requirements of this chapter may be modified through minor deviation approval
based upon specific findings that the characteristics of a use or its immediate
vicinity do not necessitate the number of parking spaces required, and that
reduced parking will be adequate to accommodate all parking needs generated by
the use. To grant a modification, the Planning and Building Director must make
the following findings:
      (1)   That neither present nor anticipated future traffic volumes
generated by the use of the site in the vicinity reasonably require strict or
literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation;
      (2)   That the granting of the variance will not create a safety hazard
or loading of vehicles on public streets in such a manner as to interfere with
the free flow of traffic on the streets;
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not create a safety hazard
or any other condition inconsistent with the objectives of this title.
   (M)   Bicycle racks. Lots with 40 or more spaces may substitute a bicycle
rack providing space for at least five bicycles at a ratio of one bicycle rack
for each 40 spaces. One parking space may be subtracted for each five-space
bicycle rack.
   (N)   Handicapped parking. Handicapped parking spaces shall be provided and
designed per requirements contained in the California Building Code.
   (O)   Tandem spaces. Tandem parking is allowed in the following:
      (1)   Mobile home parks.
      (2)   Commercial parking structures with valet parking.
   (P)   Compact parking spaces. Compact parking spaces may be allowed by the
Planning Commission to accommodate parking lot landscape planters. Compact
spaces shall be 9 feet by 16 feet with a two-foot overhang. Compact spaces may
not exceed 10% of the overall required on-site parking.
   (Q)   This section is not intended to allow the storage of abandoned,
dismantled, wrecked, inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on the side yard,
set back areas and back yards.
   (R)   All vehicle parking areas within single-family zones shall occur on
approved paved surfaces such as concrete or asphalt, except for vehicles parked
in side yard setback areas and back yards which are enclosed by a six-foot high
solid fence, such that the vehicles are not visible from the adjacent street or
alley. Any request to use alternative surfaces such as gravel or turf stone
shall be approved by the Planning and Building Director under Administrative
Approval (
Chapter 10.136).

      (2)   Design standards.
         (a)   Location. To the extent possible, loading facilities should be
located at the rear of the building which they serve.
         (b)   Access. All loading spaces shall be accessible from a public
street or alley, but shall be designed to preclude the need to use any public
streets for maneuvering or backing trailers into the loading space.
         (c)   Dimensions.
            1.   Minimum length: 25 feet.
            2.   Minimum width: 12 feet.
            3.   Minimum overhead clearance: 14 feet.
         (d)   Surfacing. The loading area, aisles and access drives shall be
paved to provide a durable, dustless surface and shall be graded to properly
dispose of surface water.
         (e)   Lighting. Loading areas shall be lighted to provide adequate
illumination for security and safety. Lighting fixtures shall be in scale with
the size and use of the structure. Any illumination shall be installed so as
not to cause a nuisance to adjoining properties.
         (f)   Noise reduction. Where a loading facility will be in close
proximity to residential or other noise-sensitive uses, noise reduction
measures (such as a seven-foot tall masonry wall combined with landscaping) may
be required.

§ 10.196.010 Purpose.
   (A)   The State Legislature has found:
      (1)   That the waters of the State are of limited supply and are subject
to ever increasing demands;
      (2)   That the continuation of California’s economic prosperity is
dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;
      (3)   That it is the policy of the State to promote the conservation and
efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;
      (4)   That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California
by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to
the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire
protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development; and
      (5)   That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can
and should be water efficient; and
      (6)   That Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution
specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably
required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall
not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use.
   (B)   Consistent with these legislative findings, the purpose of this
chapter is to:
      (1)   Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that
integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;
      (2)   Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing,
maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and
rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that
requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners
to achieve the many benefits possible;
      (3)   Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste
prevention for existing landscapes:
      (4)   Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied
water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the
lowest practical amount;
      (5)   Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with
neighboring local and regional agencies;
      (6)   Encourage the use of economic incentives that promote the efficient
use of water, such as implementing a tiered-rate structure; and
      (7)   Encourage cooperation between the City of Tulare and other local
agencies to implement and enforce this chapter.
   (C)   Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and
maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California's
environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals.
Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of
climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purposes of
this chapter, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:
      (1)   Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing
compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention and
promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen
production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits.
      (2)   Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements,
reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides and planting
climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.
      (3)   Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater
wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal
supplemental water after establishment.
      (4)   Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use
and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials
and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion.
      (5)   Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing
local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding invasive plants.
Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first
course of action.

§ 10.196.020 Objectives.
   The objective of this chapter is to establish landscaping regulations that
achieve the following:
   (A)   Conserve water through the selection of plants consistent with
Tulare’s Mediterranean climate, and the design of water efficient landscapes;
   (B)   Enhance the aesthetic appearance of the city by promoting development
that is well landscaped, properly irrigated and effectively maintained.
Further, encourage a landscaping scheme that facilitates the following design
concepts, where possible:
      (1)   Extensive use of vines on bare walls and fences;
      (2)   Use of plantings to create shadows and patterns against walls;
      (3)   Use of trees to create canopies and shade, especially in parking
lots;
      (4)   Use of flowering trees in informal groups to provide color and a
focal point;
      (5)   Use of informal massing or colorful plantings to create visual
interest;
      (6)   Use of berms, hedges low walls and landscaping to screen parking
areas, trash enclosures and utility areas from public rights-of-way;
      (7)   Use of space between buildings and streets for landscaping with a
hierarchy of plants including, trees, shrubs and turf or groundcover; and
      (8)   Use of a colorful landscaped edge at the base of buildings to avoid
pavement being located at the base of structures.
   (C)   Reduce ambient temperatures along streets, in parking lots and around
buildings in an effort to conserve energy that is related to cooling.
   (D)   Preserve the integrity of residential neighborhoods by using
landscaping to screen incompatible uses, provide shade for pedestrian and
vehicular traffic, and enhance the beauty of the residential setting.
   (E)   Provide for both solar access for energy generation or for winter
warming by properly placing trees in locations that encourage such purposes.

§ 10.196.063 Landscape design plan.
   (A)   For the efficient use of water, a landscape shall be carefully
designed and planned for the intended function of the project. A landscape
design plan meeting the following design criteria shall be submitted as part of
the Landscape Documentation Package.
      (1)   Plant material.
         (a)   Any plant may be selected for the landscape, providing the
estimated total water use in the landscape area does not exceed the maximum
applied water allowance. To encourage the efficient use of water, the following
is highly recommended:
            1.   Protection and preservation of native species and natural
vegetation;
            2.   Selection of water-conserving tree and turf species,
especially local native plants;
              3.   Selection of plants based on local climate suitability,
disease and pest resistance;
            4.   Selection of trees based on applicable local tree ordinances
or tree shading guidelines; and size at maturity as appropriate for the
planting area;
            5.   Selection of plants from local and regional landscape program
plant lists; and
            6.   Selection of plants from local Fuel Modification Plan
Guidelines.
         (b)   Each hydrozone shall have plant materials with similar water
use, with the exception of hvdrozones with plants of mixed water use, as
specified in §
10.196.064.
         (c)   Plants shall be selected and planted appropriately based upon
their adaptability to the climatic, geologic, and topographical conditions of
the project site. Methods to achieve water efficiency shall include one or more
of the following:
            1.   Use the Sunset Western Climate Zone System which takes into
account temperature, humidity, elevation, terrain, latitude, and varying
degrees of continental and marine influence on local climate;
            2.   Recognize the horticultural attributes of plants (i.e., mature
plant size, invasive surface roots) to minimize damage to property or
infrastructure (e.g., buildings, sidewalks, power lines), and allow for
adequate soil volume for healthy root growth; and
            3.   Consider the solar orientation for plant placement to maximize
summer shade and winter solar gain.
         (d)   Turf is not allowed on slopes greater than 25% where the toe of
the slope is adjacent to an impermeable hardscape and where 25% means one foot
of vertical elevation change for every four feet of horizontal length (rise
divided by run x 100 = slope percent).
         (e)   High water plants, characterized by a plant factor of 0.7 to 1.0
are prohibited in street medians.
         (f)   A landscape design plan for projects in fire-prone areas shall
address fire safety and prevention. A defensible space or zone around a
building or structure is required per Cal. Public Resources Code § 4291(a) and
(b). Avoid fire-prone plant materials and highly flammable mulches. Refer to
the local Fuel Modification Plan guidelines.
         (g)   The use of invasive plant species, such as those listed by the
California Invasive Plant Council is strongly discouraged.
         (h)   The architectural guidelines of a common interest development,
which include community apartment projects, condominiums, planned developments,
and stock cooperatives, shall not prohibit or include conditions that have the
effect of prohibiting the use of low-water use plants as a group.
      (2)   Water features.
         (a)   Recirculating water systems shall be used for water features.
         (b)   Where available, recycled water shall be used as a source for
decorative water features.
         (c)   Surface area of a water feature shall be included in the high
water use hydrozone area of the water budget calculation.
         (d)   Pool and spa covers are highly recommended.
      (3)   Soil preparation, mulch and amendments.
         (a)   Prior to the planting of any materials, compacted soils shall be
transformed to a friable condition. On engineered slopes, only amended planting
holes need meet this requirement.
         (b)   Soil amendments shall be incorporated according to
recommendations of the soil report and what is appropriate for the plants
selected.
         (c)   For landscape installations, compost at a rate of a minimum
depth of four cubic yards per 1,000 square feet of permeable area shall be
incorporated to a depth of six inches into the soil. Soils with greater than 6%
organic matter in the top six inches of soil are exempt from adding compost and
tilling.
         (d)   A minimum three- inch layer of mulch shall be applied on all
exposed soil surfaces of planting areas except in turf areas, creeping or
rooting groundcovers, or direct seeding applications where mulch is
contraindicated. To provide habitat for beneficial insects and other wildlife,
up to 5% of the landscape area may be left without mulch. Designated insect
habitat must be included in the landscape design plan as such.
         (e)   Stabilizing mulching products shall be used on slopes that meet
current engineering standards.
         (f)   The mulching portion of the seed/mulch slurry in hydro-seeded
applications shall meet the mulching requirement.
         (g)   Organic mulch materials made from recycled or post-consumer
shall take precedence over inorganic materials or virgin forest products unless
the recycled post-consumer organic products are not locally available. Organic
mulches are not required where prohibited by local Fuel Modification Plan
guidelines or other applicable local ordinances.
   (B)   The landscape design plan, at a minimum, shall:
      (1)   Delineate and label each hydrozone by number, letter, or other
method;
      (2)   Identify each hydrozone as low, moderate, high water, or mixed
water use. Temporarily irrigated areas of the landscape shall be included in
the low water use hydrozone for the water budget calculation;
      (3)   Identify recreational areas;
      (4)   Identify areas permanently and solely dedicated to edible plants:
      (5)   Identify areas irrigated with recycled water;

§ 10.196.064 Irrigation design plan.
   (A)   This section applies to landscaped area requiring permanent
irrigation, not areas that require temporary irrigation solely for the plant
establishment period. For the efficient use of water, an irrigation system
shall meet all the requirements listed in this section and the manufacturers’
recommendations. The irrigation system and its related components shall be
planned and designed to allow for proper installation, management, and
maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following design criteria
shall be submitted as part of the Landscape Documentation Package.
      (1)   System.
         (a)   Landscape water meters, defined as either a dedicated water
service meter or private submeter shall be installed for all non-residential
irrigated landscapes of 1,000 square feet but not more than 5,000 square feet
(the level at which Water Code 535 applies) and residential irrigated
landscapes of 5,000 square feet or greater.
            1.   A customer service meter dedicated to landscape use provided
by the local water purveyor; or
            2.   A privately owned meter or submeter.
         (b)   Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either
evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data utilizing non-volatile memory
shall be required for irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems.
         (c)   If the water pressure is below or exceeds the recommended
pressure of the specified irrigation devices, the installation of a pressure
regulating device is required to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each
emission device is within the manufacturer’s recommended pressure range for
optimal performance.
            1.   If the static pressure is above or below the required dynamic
pressure of the irrigation system, pressure-regulating devices such as inline
pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices shall be installed to meet
the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system.
            2.   Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure, and flow
reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection. These
pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage. If the
measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements shall be
conducted at installation.
         (d)   Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.). either integral or
auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable
weather conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as appropriate
for local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or
freezing weather or during rain.
         (e)   Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or
butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of
connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency
(such as a main line break) or routine repair.
         (f)   Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the
water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant
shall refer to the applicable local agency code (i.e., public health) for
additional backflow prevention requirements.
         (g)   Flow sensors that detect high flow conditions created by system
damage or malfunction are required for all non- residential landscapes and
residential landscapes of 5,000 square feet or larger.
         (h)   Master shut-off valves are required on all projects except
landscapes that make use of technologies that allow for the individual control
of sprinklers that are individually pressurized in a system equipped with low
pressure shut down features.
         (i)   The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low
head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water
flows onto non-targeted areas, such as adjacent property, non-irrigated areas,
hardscapes, roadways, or structures.
         (j)   Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as soil
type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation
systems.
         (k)   The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the
hvdrozones of the landscape design plan.
         (l)   The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet, at
a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria as described in § 10.196.061
regarding the maximum applied water allowance.

out in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, American
Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers/International Code Council's
(ASABE/ICC) 802-2014 "Landscape Irrigation Sprinkler and Emitter Standard". All
sprinkler heads installed in the landscape must document a distribution
uniformity low quarter of 0.65 or higher using the protocol defined in ASABE/
ICC 802-2014.
         (n)   It is highly recommended that the project applicant or local
agency inquire with the City of Tulare Water Utility about peak water operating
demands (on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the
effectiveness of the irrigation system.
         (o)   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is
required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.
         (p)   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched
precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
         (q)   Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing
shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
         (r)   Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required
on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to hardscapes or in high
traffic areas or turf grass.
         (s)   Check valves or anti-drain valves are required on all sprinkler
heads where low point drainage could occur.
         (t)   Areas less than ten feet in width in any direction shall be
irrigated with subsurface irrigation or other means that produces no runoff or
overspray.
         (u)   Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within 24 inches of
any non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from non-
permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low flow non-spray
technology. The setback area may be planted or implanted. The surfacing of the
setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These restrictions may
be modified if:
            1.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no
runoff occurs; or
            2.   The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or
            3.   The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or
technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation Package and clearly
demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in §
10.196.064(A)(1)(h). Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed
during the irrigation audit.
         (v)   Slopes greater than 25% shall not be irrigated with an
irrigation system with a application rate exceeding 0.75 inches per hour. This
restriction may be modified if the landscape designer specifies an alternative
design or technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation Package, and
clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur. Prevention of runoff and
erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.
      (2)   Hydrozone.
         (a)   Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope,
sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use.
         (b)   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected
based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone.
         (c)   Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from
shrubs, groundcovers, and turf to facilitate the appropriate irrigation of
trees. The nature, size and extent of the root zone shall be considered when
designing irrigation for the tree.
         (d)   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water
use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:
            1.   Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the
respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or
            2.   The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for
calculations.
         (e)   Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants
shall not be permitted.
         (f)   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan,
hvdrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On
the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and
assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the Hvdrozone
Information Table (see Appendix B Section A). This table can also assist with
the irrigation audit and programming the controller.
   (B)   The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain:
      (1)   Location and size of separate water meters for landscape;
      (2)   Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation system,
including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler heads,

§ 10.218.010 Purpose.
   This purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for individuals with
disabilities to request reasonable accommodation in seeking equal access to
housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act (hereafter “the Acts”) in the application of zoning laws and
other land use regulations, policies, and procedures.
(Ord. 16-06, passed 5-3-2016)
§ 10.218.020 Applicability.
   (A)   A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with
a disability or their representative, when the application of a requirement of
this zoning code or other city requirement, policy, or practice acts as a
barrier to fair housing opportunities. For the purposes of this chapter, a
“person with a disability” is any person who has a physical or mental
impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life
activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has
a record of such impairment. This chapter is intended to apply to those persons
who are defined as disabled under the Acts.
   (B)   A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or
exception to the rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development,
and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate
regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to
housing of their choice.
   (C)   A reasonable accommodation is granted only to the household that needs
the accommodation and does not apply to successors in interest to the site.
   (D)   A reasonable accommodation may be granted in compliance with this
chapter without the need for the approval of a variance.
(Ord. 16-06, passed 5-3-2016)
§ 10.218.030 Procedure.
   (A)   A request for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted on an
application form provided by the Community Development Department or in the
form of a letter to the Director of Community Development Department, and shall
contain the following information:
      (1)   The applicant’s name, address, and telephone number;
      (2)   Address of the property for which the request is being made;
      (3)   The current use of the property;
      (4)   The basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled
under the Acts, including verification of such claim;
      (5)   The zoning code provision, regulation, or policy from which
reasonable accommodation is being requested; and
      (6)   Why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific
property accessible to the individual.
   (B)   If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is
being made requires some other discretionary approval (including use permit,
site plan review, etc.), then the applicant shall file the information required
by division (A) of this section for concurrent review with the application for
discretionary approval.
   (C)   A request for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the
Director of Community Development Department or his/her designee, if no
approval is sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation. The
Director or his/her designee shall make a written determination within 30 days
of the application being deemed complete and either grant, grant with
modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation.
   (D)   A request for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review
with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the
Planning Commission. The written determination on whether to grant or deny the
request for reasonable accommodation shall be made by the Planning Commission
in compliance with the applicable review procedure for the discretionary
review.
(Ord. 18-01, passed 2-6-2018; Ord. 16-06, passed 5-3-2016)
§ 10.218.040 Approval findings.
   The written decision to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation
will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on consideration of the
following factors:
   (A)   Whether the housing in the request will be used by a person with a
disability protected under the Acts;
   (B)   Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is reasonable and
necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal
opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling;
   (C)   Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would not impose an
undue financial, administrative or enforcement burden on the city as “undue
financial or administrative burden” is defined in the Acts;
   (D)   Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would not require a
fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but
not limited to land use and zoning, as “fundamental alteration” is defined in
the Acts;
   (E)   The requested accommodation complies with all other applicable City
Code provisions, zoning regulations, and development standards;
   (F)   The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the
case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or
substantial physical damage to the property of other; and
   (G)   Other reasonable accommodations that may provide an equivalent level
of benefit.
(Ord. 16-06, passed 5-3-2016)
§ 10.218.050 Conditions of approval.
   In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the Director of
Community Development Department or his/her designee, or the Planning
Commission as the case might be, may impose any conditions of approval deemed
reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would
comply with the findings. The conditions shall also state whether the
accommodation granted shall be removed in the event that the person for whom
the accommodation was requested no longer resides on the site.
(Ord. 16-06, passed 5-3-2016)

and shall specify the reasons for the appeal and the grounds asserted for
relief.
   (C)   The City Council shall, by resolution, adopt and from time to time
amend a fee for the filing of appeals. Such fee shall be for the sole purpose
of defraying costs incurred for the administration of appeals. The fee for an
appeal shall be paid at the time of and with the filing of an appeal. No appeal
shall be deemed valid unless the prescribed has been paid.
   (D)   If an appeal is not filed within the time or in the manner prescribed
in this section, the right to review of the action against which the complaint
is made shall be deemed to have been waived.
   (E)   After filing an appeal, the appropriate hearing body shall conduct a

granted. Written notice of the time, date and place of hearing shall be given
to the appellant, and to any other persons who have filed a written request for

as defined in this chapter, regardless of the General Plan land use designation
or zoning applicable to the land.
   (A)   As mitigation for the conversion of critical farmland, the applicant
shall arrange for the imposition of an agricultural conservation easement on no
less than one acre of mitigation land for each acre of land proposed for
conversion. The applicant shall convey, or arrange for the conveyance of, such
agricultural conservation easement to a qualified entity. The mitigation land
shall be comparable to the land proposed for conversion, as provided in §
10.222.070 of this chapter.
   (B)   For the purposes of calculating the mitigation obligation under §
10.222.050(A), the area requiring mitigation shall be the full area of the

conversion to convey to the City of Tulare or to a qualified entity an
agricultural conservation easement in property owned by the applicant.
   (F)   The mitigation obligation set forth in this chapter shall not apply to
a legal parcel that is less than one acre in area. However, this exemption
shall not apply to a parcel that is one phase or portion of a larger project.

subject property has been subdivided into one-acre or smaller parcels in whole
or in part to avoid the mitigation obligation.

imposed by this chapter: public parks or public recreational facilities,
permanent natural open space, and trails and developed open space that are open
to the public.
   (H)   Projects designed solely to preserve, create, or enhance wildlife
habitat on agricultural land shall be exempt from the mitigation obligation in
this chapter.
   (I)   At its sole option, an applicant may choose to arrange for the
imposition of an agricultural conservation easement on a larger area of land
than the area of land proposed for conversion and thereby generate a mitigation
credit equal to the excess net acreage encumbered with the easement.
   (J)   Any excess area encumbered with the agricultural conservation easement
shall fully comply with all requirements of this chapter and shall be
comparable to the land proposed for conversion to the same degree as the
portion of the land offered to satisfy the mitigation obligation in this
chapter, including, but not limited to, the requirements for mitigation land in
§
10.222.070 and the review and approval process in §
10.222.090.

mitigation credits shall include the acreage covered by the mitigation credits.
The applicant may pass that fee through to a later purchaser of the credits.
   (L)   Mitigation credits created under this chapter may be conveyed and used
as provided in §
10.222.060.
   (M)   The qualified entity shall maintain a ledger indicating:
      (1)   The amount of credits created under this section;
      (2)   The holder of those credits;
      (3)   The administrative fees paid by the creator of the credits
attributable to the mitigation land covered by the credits; and
      (4)   Any subsequent transactions involving those credits.

applicant may choose to seek approval to implement one of the following
alternative mitigation options.
   (A)   As authorized by the City of Tulare, an applicant for conversion of
critical farmland may satisfy the mitigation obligation set forth in this
chapter by paying to a qualified entity a fee in lieu ("in-lieu fee") of
conveying an agricultural conservation easement.

in perpetuity by a qualified entity as defined in §
10.222.080.
   (B)   Mitigation land shall be comparable in nature to the agricultural land

is located has adopted a resolution approving the use of the land as
mitigation.
      (3)   The mitigation land is subject to an agricultural designation in

home and the area of any road or right-of-way easement, unless the land
proposed for conversion is smaller than ten acres.
      (5)   An appraisal shows that the value of the agricultural conservation
easement in the mitigation land is at least as high as that of an agricultural
conservation easement in the land proposed for conversion. Appraisal shall be
prepared by a licensed appraiser with experience in agricultural land
appraisal.

whole or in part, to a nonagricultural use, such as a conservation easement,
open space easement, flowage easement, avigation easement, long term
agricultural lease, profit, or an interest in the subsurface estate that would
preclude development of the surface estate. A contract entered pursuant to the
Land Conservation Act, Cal. Gov't Code § 51200 et seq. (Williamson Act) shall
not constitute an encumbrance for purposes of this section.

      (11)   The mitigation land is not owned by any public agency.
   (D)   The City Council shall not approve proposed mitigation unless it finds
that the agricultural conservation easement complies with each of the following
requirements:

land is specified in the easement and is at least as restrictive as the
requirements of the City of Tulare's Open Space/Agriculture (A) Zoning
District.
      (2)   The agricultural conservation easement prohibits all residential,
commercial, or industrial development and any other land uses or activities
that substantially impair or diminish the agricultural productive capacity of
the mitigation land or that are otherwise inconsistent with the conservation
purposes of this chapter.
      (3)   The agricultural conservation easement prohibits the landowner from
entering into any additional easement, servitude, or other encumbrance that
could prevent or impair the potential agricultural use of the mitigation land.
      (4)   The agricultural conservation easement limits the construction of
structures to those designed to facilitate agricultural use of the property,
except that this division shall not prohibit replacement of an existing home
allowed by §
10.222.070(C)(10).
      (5)   The easement provides that the mitigation land will retain water
rights at least equal to that of the land proposed for conversion in terms of
quantity, quality, and security.
      (6)   The agricultural conservation easement will be either obtained from
a willing seller or voluntarily conveyed by the applicant.
      (7)   Any existing easement, other than a right-of-way easement, deed of
trust, or other servitude or encumbrance on the mitigation land shall be
subordinated to the agricultural conservation easement.
      (8)   The agricultural conservation easement shall be approved by the
qualified entity that will hold the easement and executed by all parties with
an interest in the mitigation land.

to satisfy the mitigation obligation imposed by this chapter and that it is
subject to the requirements set forth in this chapter.
      (12)   If the agricultural conservation easement is an instrument other
than a conservation easement created under §§ 815 to 816 of the Cal. Civil Code
or an open space easement created under §§ 51070 to 51097 of the Cal. Gov't
Code, both the qualified entity and the City of Tulare have certified that the
easement will run with the land and bind successor owners of the mitigation
land in perpetuity.
      (13)   The agricultural conservation easement provides that if the
qualified entity holding the easement ceases to exist, ownership of the
easement shall pass to another qualified entity.
      (14)   The agricultural conservation easement has been approved as to
form by the City of Tulare.
   (E)   Division (D) does not prevent inclusion in an agricultural
conservation easement of requirements that are more protective of agricultural
use than the requirements set forth in that division.
   (F)   Before approving any alternative mitigation option, the City Council
shall determine that such option is consistent with the requirements in §
10.222.070(C) and §
10.222.070(D).
   (G)   After the City Council has approved an agricultural conservation
easement, the easement shall not be amended without further approval by the
City Council and compliance with any approval requirements imposed by the
Attorney General of the State of California for the amendment.
   (H)   If a court issues a judgement declaring that the purposes of this
chapter and of an agricultural conservation easement can no longer be fulfilled
by enforcement of that easement, the qualified entity holding that easement may
extinguish the easement by selling it to the fee owner of the mitigation land,
if the following requirements are met:

pursuant to stipulation, or the City of Tulare was a party to the action and
stipulated to the judgement; and

§ 11.28.020   Maximum amount of loan and eligibility.

§ 11.28.040   Transferability.
   Upon transfer of property subject to a deferred/shared appreciation loan, or
an interest therein, to a spouse or heir who occupied the property at the time
of mortgagor’s death and who is otherwise eligible for a deferred/shared

§ 11.28.050   Forgiveness.

§ 11.28.060   Repayment.
   If the owner sells the property at a bonafide sale for fair market value
(FMV), the total amount due the city shall be determined based upon the
following formula:
   (A)    The original value of the deferred/shared appreciation loan be
divided by the FMV after rehabilitation of the property as determined by a
qualified appraiser at the time of rehabilitation. This ratio shall be known as
the Shared Appreciation Value Ratio (SAVR).
   (B)    The amount due the city shall be lesser of:
      (1)   The SAVR multiplied by the sales price of the property; and
      (2)   The amount calculated by taking the sales price of the property and
subtracting from it the amounts paid out upon sale of the property to satisfy
debts owed on the property which were in a secured position superior to that of
the deferred/shared appreciation loan and the costs of any capital improvements
paid for by the property owner and the amount of all closing costs paid by the
owner. By way of example only, the following two alternatives demonstrate the
methodology for calculating the amount to be paid back to the city upon sale of
the property.
Example #1
$10,000 Loan
$50,000 Appraised Value
$60,000 Sales Price
$25,000 Outstanding 1st Mortgage
$ 5,000 Closing Costs
$ 2,000 Capital Improvements made by Owner
$10,000
$50,000 = 20% SAVR
$60,000 x 20% = $12,000
$60,000 - 25,000 - 5,000 - 2,000 = $28,000
City is paid $12,000
 
Example #2
$10,000       Loan
$50,000       Appraised Value
$60,000       Sales Price
$35,000       Outstanding 1st mortgage
$ 5,000       Closing Costs
$10,000       Capital Improvements made by Owner
$10,000
$50,000       = 20% SAVE
$60,000 x 20% = $12,000
$60,000 - 35,000 - 5,000 - 10,000= $10,000
City is paid $10,000

injunction, by specific performance, by equitable relief, or by any one or more

chapter as the city may deem appropriate which are for the protection of the
city or the bondholders or which tend to make the bonds more marketable.
(1995 Code, § 12.04.130)
§ 12.04.140   Indenture provisions in resolution of issuance.
   In the discretion of the city, any bonds issued under the provisions of this
chapter may be secured by indenture provisions in the resolution of issuance by
and between the city and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any
trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within the state and
the resolution of issuance may contain such provisions which are customarily
found in indentures including, without limitation, the provisions hereinafter
set forth. The resolution of issuance may vest in bondholders the right to
remove and appoint a new trustee or trustees. The trustee or trustees may, at
any time, own all or any part of the bonds unless otherwise provided in the
resolution of issuance. The resolution of issuance may vest in the trustee or
trustees, in trust or as agents, as provided therein and as consistent with
other provisions of this section, property, rights, powers and duties and may
provide that the revenues and any other rights be pledged as security for
repayment of the bonds, subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then
exist. The resolution of issuance may contain covenants of the city as to the
acquisition of property, the disposition of any property or part thereof, the
subjecting of additional property to the lien thereof, the issuance of
additional bonds, the custody, investment and application of all moneys, the
creation and maintenance of reserves, the disposition of insurance or
condemnation proceeds and the use of surplus bond proceeds. Any such resolution
of issuance may define events of default thereunder, which may include events
of default by a company under the project agreements, may specify the action to
be taken by the city upon an event of default, may set forth the rights and
remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees and may restrict the
individual right of action by bondholders. In addition, any such resolution of
issuance may contain such other provisions as the city may deem reasonable and
proper and which relate in any way to the security or protection of
bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such
resolution of issuance shall be treated as an administrative expense. Any
interest in property established by any resolution of issuance shall be valid
and binding from the date thereof and any revenues or amounts to cover
administrative expenses received by or on behalf of the city thereunder shall
immediately be subject to the lien thereof without any further act, which lien
shall be valid and binding as against all persons, irrespective of notice,
without any filing or recording except a filing in the records of the city. All
revenues, excepting (unless otherwise provided) bond proceeds shall further be
deemed to be trust funds and all revenues shall be held and applied solely as
provided in such resolution of issuance, but no bondholder shall, as such, be
in any manner obligated to see to the proper application thereof.
(1995 Code, § 12.04.140)
§ 12.04.150   Further provisions regarding bonds.
   All bonds issued by the city for a project shall be special obligations only
of the city, payable solely from the revenues or from the other sources
specified in the proceedings. In addition and without limitation to the other
provisions of this chapter:
   (A)   The bonds may be executed and delivered by the city at any time and
from time to time;
   (B)   The issuance by the city of one or more issues of bonds for one or
more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with
the same project or any other project, subject to such agreements with
bondholders as may then exist;
   (C)   Any bonds of the city issued hereunder at any time outstanding may, at
any time, and from time to time, be refunded by the city by the issuance of its
refunding bonds in such amount as the city may deem necessary or appropriate.
Bonds may be issued as one issue for refunding and other authorized purposes.
Any refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have then
matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and
the application of the bond proceeds to the purchase or redemption of the bonds
to be refunded thereby or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds
to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be
refunded and with such cash adjustments as may be agreed and regardless of
whether or not the bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable at the same
date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise, and
notwithstanding any other provision of the law, the proceedings for the
issuance of the refunding bonds may provide for the payment into an escrow fund
such moneys, together with the interest to be earned thereon, which will be
sufficient to pay the principal of, and interest and premium, if any on the
bonds so refunded to the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase or
maturity of the refunded bonds; and
   (D)   Each bond shall be deemed to be an investment security under the
Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by the state and a negotiable instrument,
subject only to any provisions thereof or registration or other provisions
restricting transfer and shall be deemed to have been issued for an authorized
purpose of the city in the exercise of the powers pursuant to this chapter,
provided that the city so determines in the proceedings and the determination
is recited in the bond.
(1995 Code, § 12.04.150)
§ 12.04.160   Compliance with state and federal laws.
   Any and all bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be issued in

regulations relating to the issuance of securities and the federal laws and
regulations relating to the exemption from federal income taxation.
(1995 Code, § 12.04.160)
§ 12.04.170   Sale of bonds.
   Bonds may be sold at such prices and in such manner as the Council may
direct, at public or private sale. The bonds may be sold at above or below the
par or face value thereof, but the sale price shall not be less than the
percentage of the par or face value of the bonds specified in the proceedings.
(1995 Code, § 12.04.170)
§ 12.04.180   No city debt.
   (A)   None of the bonds issued by the city pursuant to this chapter shall be
deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the city or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the city but shall be payable solely from the revenues and other
funds, if any, provided therefor in the proceedings.
   (B)   This issuance of bonds shall not directly or indirectly or

CHAPTER 12.08: HOME MORTGAGE FINANCING PROGRAM
Section
   
12.08.010   Adoption of Home Mortgage Financing Program.
   
12.08.020   Findings.
   
12.08.030   Liberal construction.
   
12.08.040   Effective date.
§ 12.08.010   Adoption of Home Mortgage Financing Program.
   Based upon the findings of the City Council, the city adopts the Program
pursuant to the Act for the purpose of increasing the housing supply for
moderate and low-income families in the city.
(1995 Code, § 12.08.010)
Statutory reference:
   Act, see Cal. Health and Safety Code Chapters 1 through 5 of Part 5 of
Division 31
§ 12.08.020   Findings.
   The City Council hereby finds and declares that:
   (A)   Decent housing is an essential motivating force in helping people to
achieve self-fulfillment in a free and democratic society;
   (B)   A healthy housing market is one in which residents of this state have
a choice of housing opportunities and one in which the housing consumer may
effectively choose within the free market;
   (C)   There exists within the city a shortage of housing available to
moderate and low-income persons, as such person are now or hereafter defined by
the provisions of the Act, and that this shortage is exacerbated during periods
of rising interest rates, particularly as high interest rates have the effect
of diminishing the number of otherwise creditworthy buyers from qualifying for
private sector mortgage capital sources, and in order to remedy this adverse
effect on potential homebuyers on the low end of the purchasing spectrum, it is
necessary to implement a public program to reduce the cost of mortgage
financing for single-family purchases for those persons unable to complete for
mortgage financing in the conventional mortgage market; and
   (D)   It is necessary, in order to implement a public program to reduce the
cost of mortgage financing, to authorize long-term, low-interest mortgages to
persons not presently eligible for financing through private sector lending
institutions to finance construction, rehabilitation and acquisition of homes,
and in order to finance the Program, to issue mortgage revenue bonds to fund
the Program.
(1995 Code, § 12.08.020)
§ 12.08.030   Liberal construction.
   The provisions of this chapter, being necessary for the welfare of the city
and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect the purpose of the
Program.
(1995 Code, § 12.08.030)
§ 12.08.040   Effective date.
   The Mayor shall sign this chapter and the City Clerk shall cause the same to
be published within 15 days after its passage at least once in Advance
Register, a newspaper of general circulation in the city. This chapter will
take effect immediately upon adoption pursuant to Cal. Health and Safety Code §
52031. The facts constituting the public purpose of this chapter are the
findings of the City Council set forth in §
12.08.020.
