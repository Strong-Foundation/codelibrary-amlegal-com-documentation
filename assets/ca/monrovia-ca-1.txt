   (C)   If an agent, manager or representative of a responsible person is
personally served with a citation, a copy thereof shall also served by first
class mail to the responsible person at his or her last-known business or
residence address as same appears in public records of the city. In such
instances, the date a copy of the citation is deposited with the U.S. Postal
Service shall constitute the issuance date of a citation.
   (D)   If service cannot be accomplished personally or by mail for citations
involving a real property-related violation of the code, the officer shall post
the citation on said real property in the city in which the citee is known to
have a legal interest in, or possession, or dominion or control of, said
property, or a portion thereof. The date of posting shall constitute the
issuance date of a citation.
   (E)   Any notice or order given pursuant to any provision of this chapter
shall be served in the manner provided for in this section, unless otherwise
stated.
   (F)   Failure of a citee to receive a citation or notice shall not
invalidate any fine, late charge, action or proceeding that is imposed or

(Ord. 2007-19 § 4 (part), 2007)
§ 1.17.060 CIVIL FINES, LATE CHARGES; COLLECTION OF FEES AND COSTS.
   (A)   The amounts of the fines imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be set
forth in a schedule of fines established by resolution of the City Council. The
City Council may, by resolution, also impose escalating fines in amounts it
deems appropriate for repeat offenses in a 12-month period. The amounts of
fines may be modified from time to time by a resolution of the City Council.
   (B)   If a violation is classified as an infraction under the code, the
civil fine shall not exceed $100 for a first offense, $200 for a second offense
within one year, and $300 for a third offense within one year as set forth in
Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 25132(b) and 36900(b). The amounts of such fines may be
modified from time to time by a resolution of the City Council provided they do
not exceed the limits allowed by state law.
   (C)   Failure to pay a civil fine within the period required from the
issuance date of a citation shall result in a late charge as established by a
resolution of the City Council. The amount of a late charge may be modified
from time to time by a resolution of the City Council.
   (D)   The City Council may, by resolution, also establish and impose a daily
interest charge on fines that are not fully paid to the city within 60 days of
their issuance when they are not contested, or within 60 days of their non-
payment following the decision of a hearing officer or a judicial officer to
uphold or confirm the fine. Interest shall not be imposed on a late charge. The
rate of interest and the commencement of its accrual may be modified from time
to time by a resolution of the City Council.
   (E)   Civil fines and any late charges and interest due shall be paid to the
city at such location or address as stated in the citation, or as may otherwise
be designated by the City Manager.

calendar days from the issuance date of a citation. Thereafter, a late charge
shall be due and owing, as well as interest, as imposed by this chapter.
   (G)   Payment of a civil fine shall not excuse or discharge a citee from the
duty to immediately abate a violation of the code, nor from any other
responsibility or legal consequences for a continuation or repeated occurrence
(s) of a violation of the code.
   (H)   Abatement of a violation shall not excuse the obligation of a citee to
pay a civil fine, or any late charge or interest.
   (I)    Unpaid civil fines and/or late charges, as well as interest shall
constitute a debt that may be collected in any manner allowed by law. The city
shall be entitled to recover its attorney fees and costs arising from an action
to collect a civil fine and/or late charge if it is the prevailing party and
provided it made the election to seek attorney fees at the commencement of the
action. A citee shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees if the
city made the election to seek attorney fees at the outset of the action and
the citee prevails thereon.
   (J)   The city may record a Notice of Lien Claim against real property in
the city with the County Recorder’s Office, on a form approved by the City
Attorney or City Prosecutor, for an unpaid civil fine when all of the following
conditions have been met:
      (1)   The citee has an ownership interest in real property in the city.
      (2)   The citee committed, or was responsible for, the commission of a
violation that occurred on, or concerned, that real property.
      (3)   The citation has become final or confirmed because:
         (a)   The citee failed to request an administrative hearing by the
required date, or did not do so in a timely manner; or
         (b)   The citee failed to appeal a hearing officer’s decision
upholding a citation to the superior court by the required date, or did not do
so in a timely manner; or
         (c)   The superior court ruled against the citee and upheld the
citation.
      (4)   The fine, as well as any late charges and accrued interest, have
not been fully received by the city within 30 calendar days of the date
referenced in division (3)(a), (b) or (c).
      (5)   A copy of the notice of claim shall be mailed by first class mail
to the citee to the address shown in the citation.
   (K)   Upon receipt of the entire amount of the city’s unpaid civil fine, as
well as all late charges and accrued interest, the city shall, within 30
calendar days of said date, record a notice of rescission of lien claim with
the County Recorder’s Office. The City Attorney or City Prosecutor shall
approve this form. A copy of the notice of rescission of lien claim shall be
mailed by first class mail to the citee to the address shown in the citation.
(Ord. 2007-19 § 4 (part), 2007)
§ 1.17.070 RIGHT TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING; WAIVER OF ADVANCE DEPOSIT OF
FINE.
   (A)   Any citee may contest the violation(s), or that he or she is a
responsible person, by filing a request for an administrative hearing on a
city-approved form with the Office of the City Clerk – Monrovia City Hall, 415
South Ivy Avenue, Monrovia, CA 91016, within 15 calendar days from the issuance
date of a citation. If the Office of the City Clerk does not receive the
request in the required period, the citee shall have waived the right to a
hearing and the citation shall be deemed final.
   (B)   No fee shall be charged for the filing of a request for a hearing.
   (C)   Requests for a hearing shall be accompanied by the entire amount of
the fine stated in the citation. Failure to deposit a fine, or the tender of a
non-negotiable check in the required period, shall render a request for an
administrative hearing incomplete and untimely. Fines that are deposited with
the city shall not accrue interest. Fines deposited shall be returned to the
person tendering the fines in the event a citation is overturned.
   (D)   A citee who is financially unable to deposit the civil fine with his
or her request for a hearing may complete a city-approved application form for
an advance deposit hardship waiver (hereafter the “Hardship Waiver”). This form
and all required accompanying records shall be tendered, along with a request
for a hearing, to the Office of the City Clerk – Monrovia City Hall, 415 South
Ivy Avenue, Monrovia, CA 91016, within 15 calendar days from the issuance date
of a citation.
   (E)   To be considered for a hardship waiver, the application form must be
complete, signed, and must be accompanied by documents that enable the city to
reasonably determine the citee’s present inability to deposit the fine.
Documents suitable for consideration, may include, without limitation,
accurate, complete and legible copies of state and federal income tax returns
and all schedules for the preceding tax year; financial statements, loan
applications, bank account records, income and expense records for twelve
months preceding submittal of the waiver form, as well as other documentation
demonstrating the citee’s financial hardship. The city may, at a time chosen in
its sole discretion and after a citation is final or confirmed, destroy or
discard the documents submitted by a citee for a hardship waiver without prior
notice to the citee.
   (F)   Failure to submit a completed, signed hardship waiver form, along with
records that support a claim of financial hardship, shall render the request
for hearing incomplete and untimely. In this event, the citee shall have waived
the right to a hearing and the citation shall be deemed final.
   (G)   The city shall issue a written decision specifying the reasons for
issuing or not issuing the hardship waiver. This decision is final and non-
appealable. The decision shall be served upon the person requesting the
hardship waiver by first class mail.
      (1)   Approval of a hardship waiver shall result in the city setting a
hearing pursuant to division (I) of this section.
      (2)   If the city determines that the citee is not entitled to a hardship
waiver, he or she shall tender the full amount of the civil fine to the office
of the City Clerk within seven calendar days of the date the decision is
deposited with the U.S. Postal Service. In the event the City Clerk does not
receive the full amount of the fine in the required period:
         (a)   A late charge shall be imposed;
         (b)   The request for a hearing is rendered incomplete and untimely;
and
         (c)   The citee shall have waived the right to a hearing and the
citation shall be deemed final.
   (H)   A request for a hearing shall contain the following:
      (1)   The citation number.
      (2)   The name, address, telephone and any facsimile numbers, of each
person contesting the citation.
      (3)   A statement of the reason(s) why a citation is being contested.
      (4)   The date and signature of the citee(s).
   (I)   The person filing the request for a hearing shall be notified in
writing by first class mail of the date, time and place set for this proceeding
which shall be conducted within 60 days of the date a timely and complete
request is received by the office of the City Clerk. Such notice shall be given
at least ten calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. Service of this
notice is deemed complete at time of mailing. The failure of a citee to receive
a properly addressed notice shall not invalidate the citation or any hearing,
city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter.
   (J)   If the officer submits an additional written report concerning the
citation to the office of the City Clerk for consideration at the hearing, then
a copy of this report shall also be served by first class mail on the person
requesting an administrative hearing no less than three calendar days prior to
the date thereof. Failure to receive said report shall not invalidate the
citation or any hearing, city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this
chapter.
   (K)   A timely request for a hearing shall not excuse a citee from the duty
to immediately abate a violation of the Code, nor from any other responsibility
or legal consequences for a continuation or repeated occurrence(s) of a
violation of the Code.
(Ord. 2007-19 § 4 (part), 2007)
§ 1.17.080 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING – PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The City Manager shall designate or appoint a hearing officer who
shall be selected in a manner that avoids the potential for pecuniary or other
bias and in no event shall the citing officer be the hearing officer.
   (B)   Administrative hearings are informal and formal rules of evidence and
discovery do not apply. The city bears the burden of proof to establish a
violation and responsibility therefore by a preponderance of evidence. The
citation is prima-facie evidence of the violation, however, and the officer who
issued the citation is not required to attend or participate at the hearing.
The citee(s), and officer, if present, shall have an opportunity to present
evidence and witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. A citee may bring an
interpreter to the hearing provided there is no expense to the city therefore.
The hearing officer may question any person who presents evidence or who
testifies at any hearing.
   (C)   A citee may appear at the hearing in person or by written declaration
executed under penalty of perjury. Said declaration and any documents in
support thereof shall be tendered to and received by the office of the City
Clerk at least three city business days prior to the hearing. If the citee
fails to attend the scheduled hearing, or does not submit a written declaration
in a timely manner, he or she shall be deemed to have waived the right to a
hearing. In such an instance, the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing and
not render a decision. In such instances, the citation shall be deemed final.
   (D)   Hearings may be continued once at the request of a citee or the
officer who issued the citation. The hearing officer may also continue the
hearing for cause.
(Ord. 2007-19 § 4 (part), 2007)
§ 1.17.090 HEARING OFFICER DECISION; RIGHT OF APPEAL THEREFROM.
   (A)   After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the
hearing, the Hearing officer shall issue a written decision to uphold or
overturn the citation and shall state the reasons therefore. If the citation is
upheld and the violation has not been fully corrected as of the date of the
hearing, the hearing officer shall order correction thereof in the decision and
state deadline(s) to complete said action(s). The decision of the hearing
officer shall be final.
   (B)   The citee(s) shall be served by first class mail with a copy of the
hearing officer’s written decision. The date the decision is deposited with the
U.S. Postal Service shall constitute the date of its service. The failure of a
citee to receive a properly addressed decision shall not invalidate or any
hearing, city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   Decisions of the hearing officer are, in accordance with Cal. Gov’t
Code § 53069.4(b), appealable to the superior court within 20 days after the
date of their service. Each decision shall contain a statement advising the
citee(s) of this appeal right and the procedures and court-filing fee for its
exercise. A citee shall serve a copy of the court filed Notice of Appeal on the
office of the City Clerk – Monrovia City Hall, 415 South Ivy Avenue, Monrovia,
CA 91016, by personal service or first class mail within five calendar days of
filing the original thereof.
   (D)   If a hearing officer’s decision is not appealed in a timely manner,
the decision shall be deemed confirmed.
   (E)   The superior court is the sole reviewing authority and an appeal from
a hearing officer’s decision is not appealable to the City Council. If a
responsible person prevails on appeal, the city shall reimburse his or her
filing fee, as well as the fine deposit in accordance with the court judgment.
These monies shall be mailed to the responsible person within 30 calendar days
of the city’s receipt of a notice of judgment or ruling from the superior Court
Clerk.
(Ord. 2007-19 § 4 (part), 2007)
§ 1.17.100 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISION.
   Failure of a citee to comply with a corrective action stated in any
uncontested citation, or with regard to a correction order in any hearing
officer decision that is deemed confirmed and not appealed to the superior
court, shall constitute a misdemeanor.

in a clean, sanitary, safe and accessible condition, to adequately protect the
health, safety, environment and general welfare of the community, and to ensure
that these public areas are used for their intended purposes and remain
accessible to all citizens, businesses and visitors in the city. Nothing in
this chapter is intended to interfere with otherwise lawful and ordinary uses
of public property.

§ 3.21.010 SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Fire Service
Impact Fee Ordinance.”
   (B)   The City Council has the authority to adopt this chapter pursuant to
Cal. Gov't Code §§ 66000 et seq.
   (C)   There is hereby established a revenue source to be known as the Fire
Service Impact Fee.
   (D)   This chapter is intended to require developers and builders to
contribute their proportionate share of revenues necessary to accommodate the
impacts having a rational nexus to the proposed building, development or
addition, and for which the need is reasonably attributable to the proposed
building, development or addition.
   (E)   This chapter shall be applied only to new construction, including
additions, new buildings, demolitions and re-build (except as exempted) within
the city.
(`83 Code, § 3.21.010) (Ord. 01-012 § 1, 2001)
§ 3.21.020 FINDINGS.
   (A)   There is reasonable relationship between the new commercial,
industrial and residential development to which this fee applies and service
fee established and imposed by this chapter because it recovers only the cost
of meeting new and additional service and facilities demands generated by the
developments on which the fee is imposed.
   (B)   The purpose of the fee shall be to help fund the new capital and
equipment needs of the Fire Department in order to meet service and facilities
demands generated by the development projects in the city on which the fee is
imposed.
   (C)   A strategic plan and capital improvement and equipment plan have been
completed and updated as of July 1, 2015 which identify the needs to be
generated by new development for at least the next five years. Said documents
are on file in the Fire Department and incorporated into the legislative
history of this chapter by this reference.
   (D)   (1)   New construction will increase demands for increased emergency
response activity including fires, medical emergencies and other public service
demands because of additional building area or increased occupant loading.
Industrial buildings contain a higher than average amount of combustible fire
loading, flammable liquids and hazardous materials which increases the fire
hazard and risk. The new risks and demands for service create additional demand
for Fire Department capital improvements and expenditures.
      (2)   New buildings and additions in the hillside areas increase the risk
of structure fires because of the exposure to brush vegetation, and also
increase the risk of vegetation fires because of the added persons and building
area in the very high fire hazard severity zone. Very large homes increase the
service demand because of the added area that requires fire protection of
contents and the building. New construction not protected by automatic fire
sprinklers increases the risk of fire occurring and growing to a size that can
overtax the Fire Department services. The impact fee will provide for new
equipment, facilities and apparatus in order to meet the service demands
created by new development.
   (E)   The fee amount shall be based upon an analysis of the cost of meeting
facilities and equipment-related service demands reasonably expected to be
generated by the new developments to which it applies.

makes payment for a building permit for new construction.
    NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any new building, additions to existing buildings, and
any demolition and re-build (except as exempted).
(`83 Code, § 3.21.030) (Ord. 01-012 § 1, 2001)
§ 3.21.040 CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF FEES.
   (A)   The amount of the Fire Service Impact Fee shall be established from
time to time by resolution approved by the City Council consistent with the

shall be responsible for the calculation of the fees required by this chapter.
The calculation shall be made at the time of plan review.
   (B)   The Building Division shall be responsible for collection of the fees
required by this chapter from the calculations made by the Fire Department.
   (C)   Any applicant for a permit to which the fees imposed by this chapter
applies shall pay the fees due at the time of final inspection or the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first.
   (D)   The Fire Service Impact Fee shall apply to all new construction except
as exempted by this chapter.
   (E)   If a development or new construction will be constructed in phases and
separate building permits will be issued for each phase, fees imposed pursuant
to this chapter may be made separately for each phase of the project so that
the amount of the fees due shall be limited only to the actual construction in
each phase.

   (A)   Any person subject to the fees imposed by this chapter may apply in
writing to the Development Review Committee for a reduction or adjustment to
that fee, or a waiver of that fee, upon a showing that (1) the city has

§ 3.22.010 SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY, AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Traffic Impact
Fee Ordinance."
   (B)   The City Council has the authority to adopt this chapter pursuant to
Cal. Gov't Code § 66000 et seq. and the general laws of the State of
California.
   (C)   New development within the city has and will result in additional
growth and that such growth will place additional burdens on various city
facilities, infrastructure, and services ("facilities"). Those impacts will
require an expansion of services and infrastructure in order to meet and
accommodate them, which revenues generated through property taxes and other
means are generally insufficient to accommodate. The implementation of this
chapter is necessary to require developers to contribute their proportionate
share of revenue necessary to accommodate the impacts of their projects in a
way that has a rational nexus to the proposed building, development or
addition, and for which the need is reasonably attributable to the proposed
development.
(Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.020 ESTABLISHMENT OF TRAFFIC IMPACT FEES.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the applicant for a building
permit proposing new development shall pay the following development impact
mitigation fees according and pursuant to the procedure set forth in this
chapter, along with any other required fee or fees established in this code or
other applicable law:
   (A)   A traffic impact fee (TIF) is hereby established on new development
within the mitigation area established by the traffic impact fee study to pay
for transportation improvements identified in the adopted Traffic Capital
Improvement Plan (T-CIP), as the same may be amended by the City Council from
time to time. The City Council shall, in a resolution, set forth the specific
amount(s) or rate(s) of the fee, describe the area in which the TIF is to be
imposed, and list the specific public improvements to be financed by the TIF,
describe the estimated cost of these facilities, describe the reasonable causal
relationship between the fee and the impacts associated with various types of
new development and set forth time for payment.
   (B)   The amount of the TIF shall be established, and may be updated from
time to time, by resolution approved by the City Council consistent with the
procedural requirements of the Mitigation Fee Act.
   (C)   On a biennial basis, the City Council shall review the proposed
transportation improvements to be funded with revenue from the TIF as part of
the T-CIP and determine whether the fees continue to be reasonably related to
the impacts of developments and whether the described public facilities are
still needed.
Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.030 LIMITED USE OF TIF COLLECTED.
   The revenues raised by payment of the TIF imposed by this chapter shall be
held placed in a separate and special account and such revenues, along with any
interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to pay for the city's
future construction of facilities described in the resolution enacted pursuant
to §
3.22.020, or to reimburse the city for those described or listed public
facilities constructed by the city with funds advanced by the city from other
sources, or to reimburse developers who have been required or permitted to
construct facilities included in the applicable adopted Capital Improvement
Plan and who have not received a full credit against TIF due.
(Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.040 CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Calculation of impact fees. The Director of Community Development or
designee shall be responsible for the calculation of the fees required by this
chapter. The amount due under this chapter shall be determined based on the TIF
rate at the time of submittal into building plan check for the project.
Following project submittal, the city shall provide the applicant with notice
in writing, a statement of the amount of the TIF and notification of the ten-
day appeal period.
   (B)   Collection of impact fees. The Building Division shall be responsible
for the collection of fees required by this chapter. Any applicant for a
building permit for new development to which the fees imposed by this chapter
apply shall pay the fees due prior to the issuance of final certificate of
occupancy. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to change the due date for
payment of other fees imposed according to applicable law.
      (1)   For multi-family developments, the entire TIF fee must be paid at
the time final occupancy is issued for the first dwelling in the development
covered by that building permit.
      (2)   If a new development will be constructed in phases and separate
building permits will be issued for each phase, TIF imposed pursuant to this
chapter may be made separately prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for each phase of the project so that the amount of the fees due
shall be limited only to the actual construction in each phase.
(Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.050 EXEMPTIONS AND CREDIT FOR EXISTING DEVELOPMENT.
   The following shall be exempt from the fees established by this chapter:
   (A)   Projects initiated by the city, or projects owned or initiated by any
other government entity intended to serve a public purpose. Proprietary
projects or projects that benefit private entities are not exempt from the
payment of fees imposed by this chapter.
   (B)   Change of use of existing structures with no additional floor area
added.
   (C)   New residential development consisting of the construction of a total
of four or fewer residential units, except that a residential development of
four or fewer units shall become subject to the requirements of this chapter if
the development is converted to a project of more than four units.
   (D)   (1)   Residential units which are deed or covenant restricted for
occupancy only by persons of very low, low, or moderate income according to
then-current income definitions for Los Angeles County for at least 55 years
following occupancy.
      (2)   For mixed income or mixed use developments (residential and mixed
use), the total TIF due shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the fee per
income restricted residential unit. To determine the reduced TIF due, the total
TIF due without reduction shall be divided by the total number of units to
determine the TIF per unit. The number of income restricted units shall be
multiplied by the TIF per unit, and the resulting total shall be subtracted
from the total TIF. In mixed use developments, no credit shall be applied to
TIF due for commercial portions, and the TIF for commercial development shall
not be calculated as a part of the total TIF for residential units.
   (E)   Non-residential development of less than 1,000 square feet in total
floor area.
   (F)   Rebuilding of structures damaged by fire, earthquake and other natural
disasters that would otherwise be subject to the impact fee. The floor area of
the rebuild must be the same size as the original building floor area or
smaller.
   (G)   Credit for existing development. For a project that involves the
demolition of an existing structure and the construction of a new structure,
the applicant shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of the TIF associated
with the building size of the structure that is demolished. The methodology for
determining the credit shall be contained in the applicable resolution.
   (H)   Accessory dwelling units and second units as defined in this code.
(Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.060 DEVELOPER CONSTRUCTION OF TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENT MITIGATION FACILITIES.
   Whenever a developer is required, as a condition of approval or mitigation
measure for a new development permit, to construct a public facility described
in the adopted T-CIP, the developer shall receive in-lieu credit against
applicable TIF for the developer's actual cost of construction, on a dollar for
dollar basis, against the TIF which would otherwise be charged. The in-lieu
credit shall be no more than the estimated amount contained in the adopted
Capital Improvement Plan adjusted for inflation, and shall not include any
amount for the developer's profit associated with constructing the improvement.
(Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.070 FEE ADJUSTMENTS AND APPEALS.
   Any person subject to the fees imposed by this chapter may apply in writing
to the City Council for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of the fee based on
any one or more of the following factors: (1) that there is an alleged absence
of reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of that development and
the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed by the
TIF as identified in the T-CIP; (2) that the city has incorrectly calculated
the TIF owed; or (3) that the law otherwise requires the relief sought.
   (A)   The appeal application shall be made in writing and filed with the
City Clerk during regular business hours as posted not later than ten days
after the city issues the statement of the fees owed applicable to the project.
   (B)   The appeal application shall state in detail the factual basis,
pursuant to this section, for the claim of waiver, reduction or adjustment. The
City Council shall consider the application at a duly-noticed public hearing
within 60 days after the filing of the fee adjustment application. The City
Council shall issue a written decision on the appeal not more than 30 days
following the closure of the public hearing. The decision of the City Council
shall be final.
   (C)    If a reduction, adjustment or waiver is granted, any change in use
within the project that will intensify the impacts of the original project
shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee.
(Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.080 AUTOMATIC ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.
   The amount of the fees imposed by this chapter may be adjusted annually for
inflation on each July 1 by the annual percentage change in the California
Construction Cost Index (CCCI), or any similar successor index, over the
previous 12-month period as specified in the resolution that adopts the fee
amount or based on the change in costs based on the periodic update of the T-
CIP prepared and adopted pursuant to this chapter and the Mitigation Fee Act.
(Ord. 2019-05 § 7, 2019)
§ 3.22.090 EXPENDITURES AND ACCOUNTING.
   The city shall collect and expend revenue collected pursuant to this chapter
only for the purposes, and within the time, permitted by this chapter and the
Mitigation Fee Act. Revenue collected shall be separately accounted for and
held pursuant to the requirements of Cal. Gov't Code § 66006 or any successor
statute.

§ 3.24.095 LOCAL VENDOR PREFERENCE.
   The City Council hereby finds and determines that it is in the best interest
of the city to support and promote local business entities. Vendors located
within the city, and whose sales are, or would be, recorded in the city, shall
be encouraged to bid on supplies, equipment, materials and services purchased
by the city through the provisions of a 3% local vendor's preference. The
preference shall apply to the analysis of bids for taxable and non-taxable
materials, equipment, supplies and services, but not to any public works
projects. In the comparison of all formal bids and informal quotations, the bid
price of all qualifying local vendors shall be ranked as if it were reduced by

applicable in the comparison of the bid price only. All other factors in
determining lowest and best responsible bidder shall not be compromised.

§ 3.24.100 PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
   (A)   When the City Manager or City Council authorizes the hiring of
professional services, as defined in section §
3.24.020, for which standard specifications cannot be developed due to the
nature of the service or because of national association bylaws or professional
policies prohibiting competitive bidding, the City Manager may authorize
officers and/or employees to negotiate for the authorized service. Proposals
shall be submitted, whenever practical, from at least three firms. However,
recognizing the uniqueness of professional services and the varied qualities
presented by differing firms, the City Manager shall have the authority to
determine the necessity and appropriateness of soliciting multiple proposals.
   (B)   The City Manager or his or her designee, and the Administrative
Services Director are authorized to approve and execute professional service
contracts with an estimated value of $25,000 or less. All contracts for
services exceeding $25,000 shall be approved by the City Council, except when
it is necessary to hire a consultant for the preparation of an environmental
impact report for private development projects as provided for in the
California Environmental Quality Act and applicable state and city regulations,
in which case the City Manager shall have the authority to execute a written
contract of a higher amount.

§ 3.24.110 EMERGENCY PURCHASES.
   (A)   In case of a declared local emergency, or the city's preparation for
an anticipated local emergency, which requires immediate purchase of supplies
or contractual services, the City Manager shall be empowered to authorize the
Purchasing Agent to secure by open market procedure as set forth in this
chapter, at the lowest reasonably obtainable price, any supplies or contractual
services regardless of the amount of the expenditure.
   (B)   A full report of the circumstances of an emergency purchase shall be
filed by the City Manager with the City Council at its next regular meeting and
shall be entered in the minutes of the Council and shall be open to public
inspection.

§ 3.24.120 EXCEPTIONS TO BIDDING AND QUOTATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Purchases of supplies, equipment and services for the city shall be
exempt from the purchasing provisions provided in this chapter under the
following circumstances:
      (1)   When the amount of purchase involved is $5,000 or less;
      (2)   When it is to the city's advantage to combine its purchases with
those of another governmental entity in order to effect economies by bidding
combined requirements, and the governmental entity actually soliciting the bids
employs a bidding procedure adequate to ensure competition among responsible
bidders. For example, the city may award a contract to a vendor through "piggy
backing," in which a competitive bid procedure has been conducted by another
public agency and the city's purchase is awarded on the same general terms as
the other public agency;
      (3)   When the City Council finds that negotiation instead of bidding/
quotation shall best serve the city due to the specialized nature of supplies,
equipment or services;
      (4)   When the purchase can only be obtained from one manufacturer or
vendor due to licensing or contractual restrictions, and is deemed a Sole
Source purchase;
      (5)   When the city seeks to purchase or lease any land, building, or
facility;
      (6)   When the city finds that it must initiate emergency purchases, as
provided in section §
3.24.110 of this chapter;
      (7)   When the purchase is for office supplies and event materials;
      (8)   When the purchase is for travel expenses;
      (9)   When the purchase is for a subscription, dues, trade circular, book
or periodical;
      (10)   When the purchase is for publishing a notice or advertisement in a
local newspaper;
      (11)   When the purchase is for postage or delivery services;
      (12)   When the purchase is for specialized computer software, computer
equipment and maintenance services; and
      (13)   When the purchase of goods or services is specialized, unique by
nature or otherwise considered not appropriate for multiple solicitations, the
competitive bidding and quotation requirements of this chapter are not
required.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the listed exemption from bidding contained in this
section, all monetary thresholds for the award and approval of the contract
contained in this chapter shall still apply.

§ 3.24.130 PROHIBITION OF INTEREST.
   Any purchase order or contract within the purview of this chapter in which
the Agent, or any officer or employee of the city is financially interested,
directly or indirectly, shall be void, except that before the execution of a
purchase order or contract, the Council shall have the authority to waive
compliance with this section when it finds such action to be in the best
interests of the city.

   The Purchasing Agent and every officer and employee of the city are
expressly prohibited from accepting, directly or indirectly, from any person,
company, firm or corporation any gift, reward or rebate, or anything of value
whatsoever as a gratuity in exchange for awarding a purchase or contract to the
donor, except where given for the use and benefit of the city. Any violation of
this section shall constitute a misdemeanor.

§ 3.24.150 SALE OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   Personal property. When it is deemed advisable by the Purchasing Agent
to dispose of any personal property belonging to the city, the Purchasing Agent
shall determine the appropriate method for the disposal of personal property,
including but not necessarily limited to open competitive formal bid, public
auction, or negotiated sale. The Purchasing Agent shall promulgate rules for
the sale of personal property.
   (B)   Real property. The sale of surplus city-owned property shall be made
pursuant to applicable state law.

§ 3.24.160 HARMLESS ERROR OR OMISSION TO BE DISREGARDED.
   No transaction covered by this chapter, or other applicable purchasing,
bidding or procurement law, shall be deemed or construed to be void or invalid
by reason of inadvertence, mistake, or excusable neglect in failing to comply
with the strict letter of said regulations, unless after an examination of the
entire transaction and the regulation governing the same, it shall appear that
the error or mistake complained of was prejudicial to one of the parties, and
that by reason of such error or mistake, the party complaining sustained and
suffered substantial injury, and that such injury would not have been probable
if such error or mistake had not occurred or existed, or the specific law in
question requires that the contract be voided. There shall be no presumption
that any error or omission is prejudicial, or that injury was done if an error
or omission is shown.

§ 3.26.040 INFORMAL BIDDING PROCEDURE.
   The following procedures shall apply to informal bids for public projects:
   (A)   Notice inviting informal bids.
      (1)   Required noticing. When a public project is permitted to be let to
contract by informal bidding pursuant to this chapter, a notice inviting
informal bids shall be mailed to all contractors on the list created pursuant
to § 3.26.030 for the category of work being bid and to all the construction
trade journals specified by the Commission in accordance with Public Contract
Code § 22036.
      (2)   Optional noticing. Notice may be also provided to any additional
contractors, publications and/or construction trade journals identified by the
City Manager or the City Manager’s designee.
      (3)   Exception. If the product or service to be procured for a public
project is proprietary in nature such that it can be obtained only from a
certain contractor or contractors, the notice inviting informal bids may be
sent exclusively to such contractor or contractors.
   (B)   Time of giving notice. All mailing of notices to contractors and
construction trade journals pursuant to this section shall be completed not
less than ten calendar days before bids are due.

describe the project in general terms and how to obtain more detailed
information about the project, and state the time and place for the submission
of bids.
   (D)   Authority to award contracts. The City Manager is authorized to award
a contract for a public project pursuant to the process set forth in this
section if the lowest bid received is $25,000 or less. Contracts valued at more
than $25,000 shall only be awarded by the City Council.
   (E)   Bids exceeding $175,000. If all bids received pursuant to the informal
process are in excess of $175,000, the City Council may adopt a resolution by a
four-fifths vote to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder at
$187,500 or less, if it determines the city's cost estimate was reasonable.
   (F)   Award of contract. Any contract awarded pursuant to this chapter shall
be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.
(Ord. 2015-02 § 2 (part), 2015)

calendar days before the date of opening the bids in a newspaper of general
circulation, printed and published in the city, or otherwise comply with the
requirements of Public Contracts Code § 22037.
   (C)   Electronic transmission of notice. The notice inviting formal bids
shall also be sent electronically, if available, by either facsimile or
electronic mail and mailed to all construction trade journals specified in
accordance with Public Contract Code § 22036. The notice shall be sent at least
15 calendar days before the date of opening the bids. The city may provide
additional notice.
(Ord. 2015-02 § 2 (part), 2015)
§ 3.26.060 PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The City Council shall adopt plans, specifications, and working details for
all public projects exceeding the amount specified in §

details, or all of these, adopted by the public agency for any public project.
(Ord. 2015-02 § 2 (part), 2015)
§ 3.26.070 AWARDING FORMAL BIDS.
   The following rules apply to awarding formal bids for public projects:
   (A)   Rejecting formal bids. In its discretion, the City Council may reject
any bids presented, if the city, prior to rejecting all bids and declaring that
the project can be more economically performed by employees of the agency,
furnishes a written notice to an apparent low bidder. The notice shall inform
the bidder of the city's intention to reject the bid and shall be mailed at
least two business days prior to the City Council meeting at which the city
intends to reject the bid. If after the first invitation of bids all bids are
rejected, after reevaluating its cost estimates of the project, the city shall
have the option of either of the following:
      (1)   Abandoning the project or re-advertising for bids in the manner
described by this chapter.
      (2)   After passing a resolution by a four-fifths vote of the City
Council declaring that the project can be performed more economically by city
employees, have the public project done by force account without further
complying with this chapter.
   (B)   Lowest bidder. If a contract is awarded, it shall be awarded to the
lowest responsible bidder. If two or more bids are the same and the lowest, the
city may accept the one it chooses.
   (C)   No bids. If no bids are received through the formal or informal
procedure, the project may be performed by the employees of the city, by force
account, or negotiated contract without further complying with this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-02 § 2 (part), 2015)
§ 3.26.080 EMERGENCIES.
   (A)   In cases of emergency when repair or replacements are necessary, the
City Council may proceed at once to replace or repair any public facility
without adopting plans, specifications, strain sheets, or working details, or
giving notice for bids to let contracts. The work may be done by day labor
under the direction of the City Manager, by contractor, or by a combination of
the two.
   (B)   In case of an emergency, if notice for bids to let contracts will not
be given, the city shall comply with Chapter 2.5 of Part 3 of Division 2 of the
Public Contract Code (commencing with § 22050).

§ 3.44.010 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax of the
City of Monrovia.”
(`83 Code, § 3.44.010)
§ 3.44.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the words set out in this section shall be
defined as follows:
   HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of a structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel,
studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house,
dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed
location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of
any room or rooms, or portion, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   OPERATOR. A person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity
of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of
any type or character other than employee, the managing agent shall be deemed
an operator for purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by
either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be
compliance by both.
   RENT. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR. The City Business License Officer.
   TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy or
is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access,
license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or
less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so
occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period
of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the
operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In
determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter,
being May 16, 1978, may be considered.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.020)
§ 3.44.030 IMPOSITION.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to
and shall pay a tax in the amount of 12% of the rent charged by the operator.
Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be due
upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason
the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may
require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.030) (Ord. 92-12 § 1, 1992; Ord. 2018-02 § 1, 2018)
§ 3.44.040 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The tax enacted by this chapter shall not be imposed upon any person
or agency defined in the following:
      (1)   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond
the power of the city to impose the tax provided in this chapter;
      (2)   Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business;
      (3)   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.
   (B)   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by
the Tax Administrator.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.040)
§ 3.44.050 OPERATOR'S DUTIES.
   (A)   Collection of tax. Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this
chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from
every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount
of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment
from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will
be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the
rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner
provided in this chapter.
   (B)   Registration. Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter,
or within 30 days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator
of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the
Tax Administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration
certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
      (1)   The name of the operator;
      (2)   The address of the hotel;
      (3)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
      (4)   The following statement:
This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person
named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform
Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for
the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those
requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this
city. This certificate does not constitute a permit.
   (C)   Reporting and remitting. Each operator shall, on or before the last
day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close
of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax
Administrator, make a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms provided by
him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected
for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of
the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate
holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax, and
he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due
immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by
operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of
the city until payment thereof is made to the Tax Administrator.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.050)
§ 3.44.060 TAX PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (A)   Generally. Penalties shall apply and interest shall be due as provided
in the following division of this section.
   (B)   Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of 10% of the
amount of the tax in addition to the amount of tax.
   (C)   Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of
10% of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the 10%
penalty first imposed.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.060)
§ 3.44.070 FRAUD.
   (A)   Penalty. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of
any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25% of the
amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in
§
3.44.060(B) and (C).
   (B)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of 0.5%
per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties,
from the date of which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
   (C)   Penalties merged with tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as
accrues under the provisions of this chapter shall become a part of the tax
required in this chapter to be paid.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.070)
§ 3.44.080 TAX ADMINISTRATOR DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make,
within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax
or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall
proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his estimate of the tax due.
   (B)   As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and
information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and
penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the
Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last-known place of address.
   (C)   Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such
notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on
the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined
by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable.
   (D)   If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less
than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this chapter to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.
   (E)   At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be fixed. After such hearing
the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this
chapter of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and
penalties.
   (F)   The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless
an appeal is taken as provided in §
3.44.090.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.080)
§ 3.44.090 APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days of the
serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a
time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of
the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of
notice.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.090)
§ 3.44.100 RECORDS.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment
to the city, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to
inspect at all reasonable times.
(`83 Code, § 3.44.100)
§ 3.44.110 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Grounds for refund. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or
penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or
illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be
refunded as provided in the following sections of this chapter, provided a
claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific
grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator
within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms
furnished by the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   Credits. An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against
taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or
erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a
manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax
has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient or credited or rent subsequently

written notice of the determination made pursuant to this chapter, which
determination shall be final and conclusive, unless within ten days after the

Regulations, except that the driver must show a valid California driver's
license at the time and place of testing. Requirements for rehabilitation and

the city if the driver has not tested positive subsequent to a negative result.
However, an earlier negative result will not be accepted as meeting the pre-
employment testing requirement for any subsequent employment, or any testing
requirements under the program other than periodic testing.
   (G)   All test results are confidential and shall not be released without
the consent of the driver, except as otherwise authorized or required by law.

      (1)   All licenses issued under this chapter shall be subject to the
condition that the applicant thereafter shall cease and desist from any
charitable solicitations within the city when ordered to do so by the License
Officer if the Officer finds after a hearing, upon notice, that any act or
omission of the applicant, the applicant's agent or employees in the making of
any solicitation within the city is misleading, fraudulent, or in violation of
any provision of this chapter. The License Officer must suspend or revoke the
applicant's license if, after hearing on notice, the License Officer finds the
existence of any of the grounds enumerated in this chapter for the denial of an
application for a charitable solicitation license.
      (2)   Where the License Officer has reason to believe that the conduct of
the solicitation being performed by the applicant is misleading, fraudulent, or
in violation of any provision of this chapter, the License Officer shall give
notice of intention to suspend or revoke the applicant's certificate of
registration by registered mail. The notice of intention to suspend or revoke

within two business days of such notice to determine whether or not the
certificate of registration should be suspended or revoked. The notice of
intention to suspend or revoke the license of the applicant shall contain a
statement of the facts upon which the license officer has acted in giving said
notice.

registration holder, and any other interested person, shall have the right to
present evidence as to the facts upon which the License Officer has based the
notice of suspension or revocation of the certificate of registration, and any
other facts which may aid the License Officer in determining whether a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter have occurred and whether
the certificate of registration of the applicant should be suspended or
revoked.
   (C)   Action on findings. If, after such hearing, the License Officer finds
that any provision of this chapter has been violated or that the solicitation
has been misleading, fraudulent, or otherwise misrepresented, the License
Officer shall immediately suspend or revoke the certificate of registration and
shall within two business days after the hearing file with the City Clerk and
serve upon the certificate of registration holder, and all interested persons
participating in the hearing, a notice of such revocation, together with a
written statement of the facts upon which the License Officer has based the
findings. If, after such hearing, the License Officer finds that no violation
of this chapter has occurred or that the solicitations have not been
misleading, fraudulent or otherwise misrepresented the License Officer shall,
within two days after said hearing, deliver to the applicant by mail a written
statement canceling the notice of intention to suspend or revoke the
certificate of registration and stating that no violation or misrepresentation
was found to have been committed.

this section for an additional period of 30 days upon proof that the filing of
the report within the time specified will work unnecessary hardship on the
certificate of registration holder.
   (B)   Availability of books and records of certificate of registration
holder for inspection. The certificate of registration holder shall make
available to the License Officer or to any person designated in writing by the
License Officer as his or her representative for such purpose, all books,

   (A)   At the time of filing with the License Officer an application for a
promoter's license, the applicant shall file and hereafter maintain with the
License Officer a good and sufficient bond in the aggregate sum of $5,000
running to the city for the use and benefit of interested persons and parties,
executed by the applicant and by two or more responsible sureties, or a surety
company authorized to do business in the state, to be approved by the License
Officer. The total aggregate liability on said bond shall be limited to the
payment of $5,000. Said bond shall be conditioned upon the strict compliance by
the principal with the provisions of this Article II, and for the payment of
any direct pecuniary loss sustained, through any act of grand or petty theft on
the part of the principal, by any donor or by any person on whose behalf the
funds or personal property were solicited or received by the principal.
   (B)   Said bond shall remain in force and effect for the entire period of

thereunder prior to the termination of said 30-day period.

her own name upon said bond for the recovery of any damage sustained.
   (D)   Upon the action being commenced, such bond shall not be void upon
first recovery thereon, but may be sued upon from time to time until the full
of such penalty shall be exhausted. The city may, at its discretion, require
the filing of a new bond, and immediately upon the recovery in any action on
such bond, such promoter shall file a new bond and upon failure to file the
same within ten days in either case, the License Officer shall forthwith
suspend such promoter's license to solicit.
   (E)   The time within which any action can be brought against a surety upon
any bond filed under this chapter may, by express provision in the bond to that

Officer shall issue to the applicant a promoter's license to solicit
contributions within the city. Otherwise, the License Officer shall deny the
application and refuse to issue the license, and shall notify the applicant of

denial is such that it does not substantially affect the applicant's honesty
and integrity, and if the inability of the applicant to meet any requirement

Ordinance” of the City of Monrovia.
(`83 Code, § 5.48.010) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
§ 5.48.020 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The City Council finds and determines as follows:
      (1)   The development of cable television and other telecommunications
systems may provide significant benefits for, and have substantial impacts
upon, the residents of the city.
      (2)   Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated
with telecommunications services and systems, the public convenience, safety,
and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers to be
exercised by the city.
      (3)   This chapter is intended to establish regulatory provisions that
authorize the city to regulate cable television and telecommunications services
and systems to the extent authorized by federal and state law, including but
not limited to the federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the federal
Cable Television Consumer and Competition Act of 1992, the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, applicable regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission, and applicable California statutes and regulations.
   (B)   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide for the
attainment of the following objectives:
      (1)   To enable the city to discharge its public trust in a manner
consistent with rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies,
industry competition, and technological development.
      (2)   To authorize and to manage reasonable access to the city's public
rights-of-way and public property for telecommunications purposes on a
competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis.
      (3)   To obtain fair and reasonable compensation for the city and its
residents for authorizing the private use of the public rights-of-way and
public property.
      (4)   To promote competition in cable television and telecommunications
services, minimize unnecessary local regulation of cable television and
telecommunications service providers, and encourage the delivery of advanced
and competitive cable television and telecommunications services on the
broadest possible basis to local government and to the businesses,
institutions, and residents of the city.
      (5)   To establish clear local guidelines, standards, and time frames for
the exercise of local authority with respect to the regulation of cable
television and telecommunications service providers.
      (6)   To encourage the profitable deployment of advanced
telecommunications infrastructures that satisfy local needs, deliver enhanced
government services, and provide informed consumer choices in an evolving
telecommunications market.

§ 5.48.030 DEFINED TERMS AND PHRASES.

(`83 Code, § 5.48.030) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
II. CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS
§ 5.48.100 AUTHORITY AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   In accordance with applicable federal and state law, the city is
authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct,
reconstruct, operate, and maintain cable television systems within the city
limits.
   (B)   The City Council finds that the development of cable television and
related telecommunications services may provide significant benefits for, and
substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city. Because of the complex and
rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the City Council
further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best
be served by establishing regulatory powers to be exercised by the city. This
Part II is intended to specify the means for providing to the public the best
possible cable television and related telecommunications services, and every
franchise issued in accordance with this Part II is intended to achieve this
primary objective. It is the further intent of this Part II to adopt regulatory
provisions that will enable the city to regulate cable television and related
telecommunications services to the maximum extent authorized by federal and
state law.
(`83 Code, § 5.48.100) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
§ 5.48.110 FRANCHISE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Franchise purposes. A franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this Part II may authorize the grantee to do the following:
      (1)   To engage in the business of providing cable service and such other
telecommunications services as may be authorized by law and which grantee
elects to provide to its subscribers within the designated franchise service
area.
      (2)   To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct,
replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment,
supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the
operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across
streets or other public places within the designated franchise service area.
      (3)   To maintain and operate the franchise properties for the
origination, reception, transmission, amplification, and distribution of
television and radio signals, and for the delivery of cable services and such
other services as may be authorized by law.
   (B)   Franchise required. It is unlawful for any person to construct,
install, or operate a cable television system within any street or public way
in the city without first obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this
Part II.
   (C)   Term of the franchise.
      (1)   A franchise granted under this Part II will be for the term
specified in the franchise agreement, commencing upon the effective date of the
ordinance or resolution adopted by the City Council that authorizes the
franchise.
      (2)   A franchise granted under this Part II may be renewed upon
application by the grantee in accordance with the then applicable provisions of
state and federal law and of this Part II.
   (D)   Franchise territory. A franchise is effective within the territorial
limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of
the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or resolution
granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement.
   (E)   Federal or state jurisdiction. This Part II will be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to
all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter, to
the extent authorized by applicable law.
   (F)   Franchise non-transferable.
      (1)   Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose
of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights
or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the City Council
and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the City
Council, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt
to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or otherwise dispose of the franchise without
the consent of the City Council is null and void. The granting of a security
interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or other hypothecation,
will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this division.
      (2)   The requirements of division (F)(1) apply to any change in control
of grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to the ownership
of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working
control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee is a partnership or a
corporation, prior authorization of the City Council is required where
ownership or control of 25% more of the partnership interests or the voting
stock of grantee, or any company in the tier of companies controlling the
grantee, whether directly or indirectly, is acquired by a person or a group of
persons acting in concert, none of whom, singularly or collectively, owns or
controls those partnership interests or that voting stock of the grantee, or of
grantee's upper tier controlling companies, as of the effective date of the
franchise.
      (3)   Grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or
judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee's franchise property,
or upon the termination of any lease or other interest covering all or a
substantial part of that franchise property. That notification will be
considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the
franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this division that require the
prior consent of the City Council to that change in control of ownership will
apply.
      (4)   For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an
acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee
must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any
change of ownership or control, grantee or the proposed transferee, or both,
must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its equivalent.
This application must be submitted to the city not less than 120 days prior to
the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that it possesses
the legal, financial, and technical capability to operate and maintain the
cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements during the remaining
term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of
the applicant are determined to be satisfactory, then the city will consent to
the transfer of the franchise.
      (5)   Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee's assets
to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the
franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee
satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television
system upon grantee's default in its financial obligations. Further, that
financial institution must also submit a plan for such operation within 90 days
after assuming control. The plan must insure continued service and compliance
with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial
institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution
may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding 18 months
unless authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period
of time it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise
to another grantee.
      (6)   Grantee must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable review
and processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in
control of the franchise. These expenses may include, without limitation, costs
of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical evaluation of the
proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all
costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document
preparation expenses. The total amount of these reimbursable expenses may be
subject to maximum limits that are specified in the franchise agreement between
the city and the grantee. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise
fee payable to the city during the term of the franchise.
   (G)   Geographical coverage.
      (1)   Grantee must design, construct, and maintain the cable television
system so as to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the
franchise service area, subject to any service area line extension requirements
or territorial restrictions set forth in the franchise agreement.
      (2)   After service has been established within all or any part of the
franchise service area by activating trunk or distribution cables, grantee must
provide service to any requesting subscriber within that activated part of the
service area within 30 days from the date of request, provided that the grantee
is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights-of-way
necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that 30-day period.
   (H)   Nonexclusive franchise. Every franchise granted is nonexclusive. The
city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional
franchises for a cable television system, or any component thereof, as it deems
appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. If an additional
franchise is proposed to be granted to a subsequent grantee, a noticed public
hearing must first be held in accordance with the provisions of Cal. Gov't Code
§ 53066.3.
   (I)   Multiple franchises.
      (1)   The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable
state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted,
based upon, but not necessarily limited to the requirements of applicable law
and specific local considerations, such as:
         (a)   The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple
cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility
systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas, and sewerage.
         (b)   The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable
system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.
         (c)   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations within the public rights-of-way.
      (2)   The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its
own underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city's opinion,
the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate
additional cables.
(`83 Code, § 5.48.110) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
§ 5.48.120 FRANCHISE APPLICATIONS AND RENEWAL.
   (A)   Filing of applications. Any person desiring an initial franchise for a
cable television system must file an application with the city. A reasonable
non-refundable application fee deposit in an amount established by resolution
of the City Council must accompany the application. That application fee

"Standard installations" are those that are located up to 125 feet from the
existing distribution system, unless otherwise defined in the franchise
agreement.
         (g)   The grantee must schedule, within a specified four-hour time
period Monday through Saturday (legal holidays excluded), all appointments with

must be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time that is convenient for the
subscriber. The grantee must undertake appropriate quality control measures to
ensure that the customer is satisfied with the work.
         (h)   Subscribers who have experienced one missed appointment due to
the fault of the grantee will receive an installation free of charge if the
appointment was for an installation. If an installation was to have been
provided free of charge, and for all other appointments, the subscriber will
receive one month of the subscribed-to service tier, free of charge.
Subscribers also will be entitled to receive a free installation, or one month
free service, as provided above, if the grantee fails to complete a standard
installation within seven days of receiving an installation request due to its
fault, its failure to schedule an appointment within a specified four-hour time
period, or its failure to notify the subscriber that the grantee's
representative will be late for an appointment. Subscribers who have
experienced two missed appointments due to the fault of the grantee will
receive two months of the subscribed-to service tier, free of charge, in
addition to the free installation or free month of service provided for the
first missed appointment.
         (i)   Upon a subscriber's request, the grantee will arrange for pickup

business day, excluding Sundays and holidays, after a request for service
identifying a problem concerning picture or sound quality.
      (3)   The grantee will be deemed to have responded to a request for
service under the provisions of this division (B) when a technician arrives at
the service location and begins work on the problem. If a subscriber is not
home when the technician arrives, the technician must leave written
notification of arrival.
      (4)   The grantee may not charge for the repair or replacement of
defective or malfunctioning equipment provided by the grantee to subscribers,
unless the defect or malfunction was caused by the subscriber.
      (5)   The grantee must determine the nature of the problem within 24
hours after commencing work and resolve all cable system related problems
within three business days, unless technically infeasible.
   (C)   Billing and information standards.
      (1)   Subscriber bills must be clear, concise, and understandable. Bills
must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic
and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills also must clearly
delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges,
rebates, and credits.
      (2)   The first billing to a subscriber after a new installation or
service change must be prorated based upon when the new or changed service
commenced. Subscribers must not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized
for any failure attributable to the grantee, including the failure to timely or
correctly bill the subscriber.
      (3)   In case of a billing dispute, the grantee must respond in writing
to a written complaint from a subscriber within 30 days after receiving the
complaint at the office specified on the billing statement for receiving that
complaint.
      (4)   Upon request by a subscriber, credits or refunds must be provided
by grantee to subscribers who experience an outage, interruption, or
disconnection of service of four or more consecutive hours, provided that such
loss of service is neither caused by the subscriber nor attributable to
scheduled repairs, maintenance, or construction in circumstances where grantee
has provided advance written notice to subscriber, and the loss of service does
not exceed the time period specified by grantee. For subscribers terminating
service, credits or refunds must be issued promptly, but not later than 30 days
after the return of any grantee supplied equipment.
      (5)   Subject to prior review by the city, the grantee must provide
written information on each of the following matters at the time of the
installation of service, at least annually to all subscribers, and at any time
upon request:
         (a)   Products and services offered.
         (b)   Prices and options for programming services and conditions of
subscription to programming and other services.

issues.
         (g)   Consumer protection and service standards and penalties for
noncompliance.
      (6)   Subscribers must be notified in writing of any changes in rates,
programming services, or channel positions as soon as possible. Notice must be
given to subscribers a minimum of 30 days in advance of those changes if the
change is within the control of the grantee. In addition, the grantee must
notify subscribers in writing 30 days in advance of any significant changes in
the information required above in division (C)(5) above.
      (7)   The grantee must maintain a public file containing all notices
provided to subscribers under these consumer protection and service standards
and all promotional offers made by grantee to subscribers. These documents must
be maintained for a minimum period of two years.
   (D)   Verification of compliance with standards.
      (1)   Upon 30 days prior written notice, the city may require the grantee
to provide a written report demonstrating its compliance with any of the
consumer protection and service standards specified in this section. The
grantee must provide sufficient documentation to enable the city to verify
compliance.
      (2)   A repeated and verifiable pattern of noncompliance with the
consumer protection and service standards of this section, after the grantee's
receipt of written notice and an opportunity to cure, may be deemed a material
breach of the franchise agreement.
   (E)   Subscriber complaints and disputes.
      (1)   The grantee must establish written procedures for receiving, acting
upon, and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the city. The
written procedures must prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a
complaint, either orally or in writing, specifying the subscriber's grounds for
dissatisfaction. The grantee must file a copy of these procedures with the
city. These procedures must include a requirement that the grantee respond in
writing to any written complaint from a subscriber within 30 days after
receiving the complaint at the office specified on the billing statement for
receiving that complaint.
      (2)   Upon request, and subject to applicable law protecting subscriber
privacy rights, the city has the right to review the grantee's response to
subscriber complaints.
      (3)   All subscribers have the right to continue receiving service so
long as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If
the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or if the city gives
notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, the grantee must
act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive service while the franchise
remains in force.
      (4)   Upon a change of control of the grantee, or if a new operator
acquires the cable system, the original grantee must cooperate with the city,
the new grantee, or the new operator in maintaining continuity of service to
all subscribers. During that transition period, the grantee is entitled to the
revenues derived from its operation of the cable system.
   (F)   Disconnection/downgrades.
      (1)   A subscriber may terminate or downgrade service at any time, and
the grantee must promptly comply with the subscriber's request within five days
or at any later time requested by the subscriber. No period of notice prior to
voluntary termination or downgrade of service may be required of subscribers.
Grantee will impose no charges for the voluntary termination or downgrade of
service unless a visit to the subscriber's premises is required to remove a
converter box or other equipment or property owned by grantee.
      (2)   The grantee may disconnect a subscriber's service in compliance
with Cal. Gov’t Code § 53088.2(i), (j) and (k). If service is disconnected for
nonpayment of past due fees or charges, the grantee must promptly reinstate
service upon payment in full by the subscriber of all such fees and charges,
including late charges.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the requirements of division (F)(2) above, the
grantee may immediately disconnect service to a subscriber if the subscriber is
damaging or destroying the grantee's cable system or equipment. In the event of
disconnection on such grounds, the grantee will resume service to the
subscriber upon receiving adequate assurances that the subscriber has ceased
the practices or conduct that resulted in disconnection and has paid all proper
fees and charges, including any amounts reasonably owed the grantee for the
damage caused by the subscriber.
      (4)   The grantee may also disconnect service to a subscriber when
service causes signal leakage exceeding federal limits. If service is
disconnected, the grantee will immediately resume service without charge upon
the satisfactory correction of the signal leakage problem.
      (5)   Upon termination of service to a subscriber, the grantee will
remove its equipment from the subscriber's premises within 30 days. The
equipment will be deemed abandoned if it is not removed within such time period
unless the grantee has been denied access to the subscriber's premises.
   (G)   Changes in service. Except as otherwise provided by federal or state
law, subscribers must not be required to pay any additional fee or charge,
other than the regular service fee, in order to receive the services selected
(such as upgrade or downgrade charges). No charge may be imposed for any
service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively selected.
Payment of the regular monthly bill will not by itself constitute an
affirmative selection.
   (H)   Deposits. Grantee may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory deposit
on equipment provided to subscribers. Such deposits must be placed in an
interest-bearing account. The deposit must be returned, with interest earned to
the date of repayment, within 30 days after the equipment is returned to the
grantee.
   (I)   Parental control option. Grantee must provide parental control devices
to all subscribers who desire to block the video or audio portion of any
programming that the subscriber finds objectionable. Such devices will be
provided at no charge to the subscriber, unless otherwise required by federal
or state law, or unless a converter box is required to be installed for the
purpose of providing the parental control device.
   (J)   Additional requirements.
      (1)   All officers, agents, and employees of the grantee, or of its
contractors or subcontractors, who, in the normal course of work come into
contact with members of the public, or who require entry onto subscribers'
premises, must carry a photo-identification card in a form approved by the
city. The grantee must account for all identification cards at all times. All
vehicles of the grantee or its subcontractors must be clearly identified as
vehicles engaged in providing services for the grantee.
      (2)   In addition to the consumer protection and service standards
specified in this section, the grantee must comply with all applicable consumer
protection and service standards that are imposed upon cable operators by the
following:
         (a)   Federal statutes, and the rules, regulations, and orders of the
Federal Communications Commission, including the following:
            1.   The provisions of Section 76.309(c) of Title 47 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, as it now exists or may later be amended.
            2.   The provisions of Section 76.630 of Title 47 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, as it now exists or may later be amended.
            3.   The provisions of Section 551 of Title 47, United States Code,
as it now exists or may later be amended.

service or repair transactions between cable television companies and their
subscribers.

subscribers' rights to privacy protection.
      (3)   If there is any conflict or inconsistency between a consumer
protection and service standard specified in this section and a standard set
forth in the statutes, rules, regulations, and orders that are referenced above
in division (J)(2), then the standard that is the most stringent, and that
affords the greatest degree of protection to consumers, will apply to the
extent authorized by applicable law.
   (K)   Penalties for noncompliance.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this division (K) is to authorize monetary
penalties for the violation of the customer service standards established by
this section in a manner consistent with the Video Customer Service Act (Cal.
Gov’t Code §§ 53088 et seq.), and pursuant to the city's inherent police
powers. The imposition of penalties authorized by this division (K) will not
prevent the city or any other affected party from exercising any other remedy
to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to any judicial
remedy as provided below in division (K)(2)(d).
      (2)   Administration and appeals.
         (a)   The City Manager or the City Manager's designee is authorized to
administer this division (K). Decisions by the City Manager to assess monetary
penalties against the grantee must be in writing and must contain findings
supporting the decisions. Decisions by the City Manager are final, unless
appealed to the City Council.
         (b)   If the grantee or any interested person is aggrieved by a
decision of the City Manager, the aggrieved party may, within ten days of the
written decision, appeal that decision in writing to the City Council. The
appeal letter must be accompanied by the fee established by the City Council
for processing the appeal. The City Council may affirm, modify, or reverse the
decision of the City Manager.
         (c)   Schedule of penalties. The following schedule of monetary
penalties may be assessed against the grantee for the material breach of the
provisions of the consumer protection and service standards set forth in this
section, provided that the breach is within the reasonable control of the
grantee:
            1.   For a first material breach: the maximum penalty is $200 for
each day of material breach, but not to exceed a cumulative total of $600 for
each occurrence of the material breach.
            2.   For a second material breach of the same nature within a 12-
month period for which the city has provided notice and a penalty has been
assessed, the maximum penalty is $400 for each day of the material breach, but
not to exceed a cumulative total of $1,200 for each occurrence of the material
breach.
            3.   For a third or further material breach of the same nature
within a 12-month period for which the city has provided notice and a penalty
has been assessed, the maximum penalty is $1,000 for each day of the material
breach, but not to exceed a cumulative total of $3,000 for each occurrence of
the material breach.
            4.   The maximum penalties referenced above may be increased by any
additional amount authorized by state law.
         (d)   Judicial remedy. This division does not preclude any affected
party from pursuing any judicial remedy available to that party without regard
to this division (K).
         (e)   Notification of breach. The city must give the grantee written
notice of any alleged breach of the consumer protection and service standards
and allow the grantee at least 30 days from receipt of the notice to remedy the
specified breach. For the purpose of assessing penalties, a material breach is
deemed to have occurred for each day, following the expiration of the period
for cure specified herein, that any breach has not been remedied by the
grantee, irrespective of the number of subscribers affected.
         (f)   Limitations. With respect to any grantee that operates under a
franchise or license agreement with the city, any monetary penalties assessed
under this division (K) must be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent that
any liquidated damage or penalty provision of the franchise or license
agreement imposes a monetary obligation on the grantee for the same customer
service failure, and no other monetary damages may be assessed for that
customer service failure.
(Ord. 2007-07 § 1, 2007)
§ 5.48.150 FEE FOR SUPPORT OF LOCAL CABLE USAGE.
   (A)   Parity among video service providers. The City Council has determined
that the public interest will best be served by imposing, to the extent
authorized by applicable law, comparable financial obligations upon similarly-
situated multichannel video programming providers that are franchised to
provide video services within the city. Consistent with the city's policy of
requiring franchisees to provide financial support for public, educational, and
governmental (PEG) access channel facilities and activities, a fee is
established as set forth below in division (B).
   (B)   PEG fee in effect on December 31, 2006. On December 31, 2006, the City
imposed two separate fees to support PEG channel facilities and activities.
When combined, these fees were in excess of 1%. In accordance with Cal. Public
Utilities Code § 5870(n), the city may, by ordinance, establish a fee no
greater than those separate fees.
   (C)   PEG access support fee. The city hereby establishes and imposes upon
any state video franchise holder operating in the city a fee, separate from the
5% franchise fee, to support PEG access channel facilities and activities. This
separate fee is in the amount of 1% of a video service provider's gross
revenues, plus the sum of $0.13 per subscriber, per month. The payments of
$0.13 per subscriber, per month, will terminate when the cumulative sum of
$88,381.40 has been paid to the city over the term of the franchise, or any
extension or renewal of the franchise. The restrictions and limitations set
forth below in division (D) apply to this PEG access support fee.
   (D)   Restrictions and limitations. The fee in support of PEG access channel
facilities and activities specified above in division (C), as applied to a
state video franchise holder, is subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   The fee must not exceed 3% of the holder's gross revenues, as the
term "gross revenues" is defined in Cal. Public Utilities Code § 5860.
      (2)   The fee will terminate upon expiration of the state video
franchise, but it may be reauthorized by ordinance adopted by the City Council.
      (3)   If the imposition of this fee, or any component thereof, is
determined to be contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of Cal. Public
Utilities Code § 5870 by subsequent legislative action, judicial decision, or
administrative interpretation, then an alternative fee for PEG support
obligations may be imposed by ordinance adopted by the City Council.
(Ord. 2007-07 § 2, 2007)
§ 5.48.160 SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO HOLDERS OF STATE VIDEO FRANCHISES.
   (A)   Franchise fees. A state video franchise holder operating in the city
shall pay to the city a franchise fee that is equal to 5% of the gross revenue
of that state video franchise holder. The term "gross revenue" shall be defined
as set forth in Cal. Public Utilities Code § 5860.
   (B)   Audit authority. Not more than once annually, the city may examine and
perform an audit of the business records of a holder of a state video franchise
to ensure compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations related to
the computation and payment of franchise fees.

applicable state and federal customer service and protection standards
pertaining to the provision of video service.
      (2)   The city will monitor the compliance of state video franchise
holders with respect to state and federal customer service and protection
standards. The city will provide to the state video franchise holder written
notice of any material breaches of applicable customer service and protection
standards, and will allow the state video franchise holder 30 days from receipt
of the notice to remedy the specified material breach. Material breaches not
remedied within the 30-day time period will be subject to the following
monetary penalties to be imposed by the city in accordance with state law:
         (a)   For the first occurrence of a violation, a monetary penalty of
$500 shall be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to
exceed $1,500 for each violation.
         (b)   For a second violation of the same nature within 12 months, a
monetary penalty of $1,000 shall be imposed for each day the violation remains
in effect, not to exceed $3,000 for each violation.
         (c)   For a third or further violation of the same nature within 12
months, a monetary penalty of $2,500 shall be imposed for each day the
violation remains in effect, not to exceed $7,500 for each violation.
      (3)   A state video franchise holder may appeal a monetary penalty
assessed by the city within 60 days. After relevant evidence and testimony is
received, and staff reports are submitted, the City Council will vote to either
uphold or vacate the monetary penalty. The City Council's decision on the
imposition of a monetary penalty will be final.
   (D)   City response to state video franchise applications.
      (1)   Applicants for state video franchises within the boundaries of the
city must concurrently provide to the city complete copies of any application
or amendments to applications filed with the California Public Utilities
Commission. One complete copy must be provided to the City Clerk.
      (2)   The city will provide any appropriate comments to the California
Public Utilities Commission regarding an application or an amendment to an
application for a state video franchise.
   (E)   PEG channel capacity. A state video franchise holder that uses the
public rights-of-way shall designate sufficient capacity on its network to
enable the carriage of at least three public, educational, or governmental
(PEG) access channels.
      (1)   PEG access channels shall be for the exclusive use of the city or
its designees to provide public, educational, or governmental programming.
      (2)   Advertising, underwriting, or sponsorship recognition may be
carried on the PEG access channels for the purpose of funding PEG-related
activities.
      (3)   The PEG access channels shall be carried on the basic service tier.
      (4)   To the extent feasible, the PEG access channels shall not be
separated numerically from other channels carried on the basic service tier,
and the channel numbers for the PEG access channels shall be the same channel
numbers used by the incumbent cable operator unless prohibited by federal law.
      (5)   After the initial designation of PEG access channel numbers, the
channel numbers shall not be changed without the prior written consent of the
city, unless the change is required by federal law.
      (6)   Each PEG access channel shall be capable of carrying a National
Television System Committee (NTSC) television signal.
   (F)   Interconnection. Where technically feasible, a state video franchise
holder and incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to
interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG access channel
programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable, microwave
link, satellite, or other reasonable method of connection. State video
franchise holders and incumbent cable operators shall provide interconnection
of the PEG access channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not
withhold the interconnection. If a state video franchise holder and an
incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection
agreement, the city may require the incumbent cable operator to allow the state
video franchise holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent's network
at a technically feasible point on the holder's network as identified by the
holder. If no technically-feasible point for interconnection is available, the
state video franchise holder shall make an interconnection available to the
channel originator and shall provide the facilities necessary for the
interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the state
video franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed
to by the parties.
   (G)   Emergency alert system and emergency overrides. A state video
franchise holder must comply with the emergency alert system requirements of
the Federal Communications Commission in order that emergency messages may be
distributed over the holder's network. Provisions in city-issued franchises
authorizing the city to provide local emergency notifications shall remain in
effect, and shall apply to all state video franchise holders in the city for
the duration of the city-issued franchise, or until the term of the franchise
would have expired had it not been terminated pursuant to Cal. Public Utilities
Code § 5840(m), or until January 1, 2009, whichever is later.

(`83 Code, § 5.48.210) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
§ 5.48.220 REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION.
   Within 30 days after receipt of an application filed under §
5.48.210 that is deemed to be complete, the City Manager will give written
notice to the applicant of the city's intent to negotiate an agreement setting
forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open
video system will be authorized by the city. The commencement of those
negotiations will be on a date that is mutually acceptable to the city and to
the applicant.
(`83 Code, § 5.48.220) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
§ 5.48.230 AGREEMENT REQUIRED.
   (A)   No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open
video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written
agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of
the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city.
   (B)   The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may
contain terms and conditions that relate to the following subject matters, to
the extent that such terms, conditions, and subject matters are not preempted
by federal statute or regulations:
      (1)   The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including
provisions for its renewal or extension.
      (2)   The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the
city, at specified times, fees on the gross revenues received by the operator,
as authorized by 47 CFR 76.1511, in accordance with the following standards and
procedures:
         (a)   The amount of the fees on the gross revenues will be 5%, and
will be paid in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under Section 622 of the
Communications Act.
         (b)   The term GROSS REVENUES means (1) all gross revenues received by
an open video system operator or its affiliates, including all revenues
received from subscribers and all carriage revenues received from unaffiliated
video programming providers; and (2) all advertising revenues received by the
operator or its affiliates in connection with the provision of video
programming, where such revenues are included in the calculation of the cable
franchise fee paid to the city by the franchised cable operator. The term GROSS
REVENUES does not include revenues, such as subscriber or advertising revenues,
collected by unaffiliated video programming providers.
      (3)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with
requirements relating to information collection and recordkeeping, accounting
procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and inspection of records in order to
ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenues that are required to be
paid as specified above in division (B)(2).
      (4)   The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city's
requirements with respect to public, educational, and governmental access
channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment, as provided for in 47
CFR 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are
applicable:
         (a)   The open video system operator is subject to the same public,
educational, and governmental access requirements that apply within the cable
television franchise service area with which its system overlaps.
         (b)   The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers
receive all public, educational, and governmental access channels within the
franchise service area in which the city's subscribers are located.
         (c)   The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to
establish the operator's obligations with respect to public, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment.
These negotiations may include the city's franchised cable operator if the
city, the open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so
desire.
         (d)   If the open video system operator and the city are unable to
reach an agreement regarding the operator's obligations with respect to public,
educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities,
and equipment within the city's jurisdiction, then the following obligations
will be imposed:
            1.   The open video system operator must satisfy the same public,
educational, and governmental access obligations as the city's franchised cable
operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public,
educational, and governmental access and by matching the city's franchised
cable operator's annual financial contributions in support of public,
educational, and governmental access services, facilities, and equipment that
are actually used by the city. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras or
production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory
obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city's franchised
cable operator, so that public, educational, and governmental access services
to the city are improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the
open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the
franchised cable operator's depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case
of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions
provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities
arising under Section 611 of the Communications Act.
            2.   The city will impose upon the open video system operator the
same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator
with regard to the open video system operator's use of channel capacity
designated for public, educational, and governmental access use when that
capacity is not being used for such purposes.
         (e)   The city's franchised cable operator is required under federal
law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public,
educational, and governmental access channel feeds. The open video system
operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this
connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical
characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the
franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on
how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city
may require that the connection occur on city-owned property or on public
rights-of-way.
         (f)   All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator's
public, educational, and governmental access channel feed must be borne by the
open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video
system operator's matching financial contributions set forth above in division
(B)(4)(d)1.
         (g)   The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any
public, educational, or governmental access obligations that are greater than
those imposed upon the franchised cable operator.
         (h)   If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the
provisions of 47 CFR 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the
obligations of the open video system operator.
         (i)   The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply
with new public, educational, and access obligations imposed on the city's
franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television
franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be
required to displace other programmers using its open video system to
accommodate public, educational, and governmental access channels. The open
video system operator must comply with such new public, educational, and
governmental access obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes
available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased
demand for channel capacity.
      (5)   If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree as to
the application of the FCC's rules regarding the open video system operator's
obligations to provide public, educational, and governmental access under the
provisions of division (B)(4) set forth above, then either party may file a
complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in 47 CFR 76.1513. No agreement will be executed by the city until the
dispute has been finally resolved.
      (6)   If the open video system operator intends to maintain an
institutional network, as defined in Section 611(f) of the Communications Act,
the city will require that educational and governmental access channels be
designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels
are designated on the institutional network of the city's franchised cable
operator.
      (7)   The authority of an open video system provider to exercise
editorial control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel
capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR 76.1505
(f).
      (8)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all
applicable federal and state statutes and regulations relating to customer
service standards, including the Cable Television and Video Provider Customer
Service and Information Act (Cal. Gov't Code §§ 53054 et seq.), and the Video
Customer Service Act (Cal. Gov't Code §§ 53088 et seq.)
      (9)   If new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the
city, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the
following rights-of-way use and management responsibilities that are also
imposed by the city upon other telecommunications service providers in a
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:
         (a)   Compliance with all applicable city building and zoning codes,
including applications for excavation, encroachment, and construction permits
and the payment of all required permit and inspection fees.
         (b)   The coordination of construction requirements.
         (c)   Compliance with established standards and procedures for
constructing lines across private property.
         (d)   Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification
requirements.
         (e)   The repair and resurfacing of construction-damaged streets.
         (f)   Compliance with all public safety requirements that are
applicable to telecommunications service providers using public property or
public rights-of-way.
      (10)   Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the
agreement, and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages, and other
remedies, including fines or the suspension, revocation, or termination of the
agreement.
      (11)   Requirements relating to the sale, assignment, or transfer of the
open video system.
      (12)   Requirements relating to the open video system operator's
compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules, and
regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video system.
      (13)   Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies, and
procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system
operator and that will, in the judgment of the City Council, best serve the
public interest and protect the public health, welfare, and safety.

IV. OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND SYSTEMS
§ 5.48.300 OTHER MULTI-CHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS.
   The term “cable system,” as defined in federal law and as set forth in §
5.48.400 below, does not include a facility that serves subscribers without
using any public rights-of-way. Consequently, the categories of multichannel
video programming distributors identified below are not deemed to be “cable
systems” and are therefore exempt from the city's franchise requirements and
from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law,
provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the
use of the city's public rights-of-way.
   (A)   Multi-channel multipoint distribution service (“MMDS”), also known as
“wireless cable,” which typically involves the transmission by an FCC-licensed
operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line-of-
sight technology.
   (B)   Local multi-point distribution service (“LMDS”), another form of over-
the-air wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC, and
which offers video programming, telephony, and data networking services.
   (C)   Direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”), also referred to as “direct-to-
home satellite services,” which involves the distribution or broadcasting of
programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber's premises
without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the
subscriber's premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local
regulation of direct-to-home satellite services is further proscribed by the
following federal statutory provisions:
         (1)   47 USC 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to
regulate the provision of direct-to-home satellite services.
         (2)   Section 602 of the Communications Act states that a provider of
direct-to-home satellite service is exempt from the collection or remittance,
or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction on direct-
to-home satellite service. The terms TAX and FEE are defined by federal statute
to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible tax, local income
tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross receipts tax,
excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax, or any other tax,
license, or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business,
regulating, or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction.
(`83 Code, § 5.48.300) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
§ 5.48.310 VIDEO PROVIDERS—REGISTRATION—CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Unless the customer protection and customer service obligations of a
video provider, as that term is defined in §
5.48.400, are specified in a franchise, license, lease, or similar written
agreement with the city, a video provider must comply with all applicable
provisions of the following state statutes:
      (1)   The Cable Television and Video Provider Customer Service and
Information Act (Cal. Gov't Code §§ 53054 et seq.)
      (2)   The Video Customer Service Act (Cal. Gov't Code §§ 53088 et seq.)
   (B)   All video providers that are operating in the city on the effective
date of this chapter, or that intend to operate in the city after the effective
date of this chapter, must register with the city; provided, however, that this
registration requirement is not applicable to any video provider that has
executed a franchise, license, lease or similar written agreement with the
city. The registration form must include or be accompanied by the following:
      (1)   The video provider's name, address, and local telephone numbers.
      (2)   The names of the officers of the video provider.
      (3)   A copy of the video provider's written policies and procedures
relating to customer service standards and the handling of customer complaints,
as required by Cal. Gov't Code §§ 53054 et seq. These customer service
standards must include, without limitation, standards regarding the following:
         (a)   Installation, disconnection, service and repair obligations,
employee identification, and service call response time and scheduling.
         (b)   Customer telephone and office hours.
         (c)   Procedures for billing, charges, refunds, and credits.
         (d)   Procedures for termination of service.
         (e)   Notice of the deletion of a programming service, the changing of
channel assignments, or an increase in rates.
         (f)   Complaint procedures and procedures for bill dispute resolution.
         (g)   The video provider's written commitment to distribute annually
to the city, and to its employees and customers, a notice describing the
customer service standards specified above in divisions (B)(3)(a) through (f)
above. This annual notice must include the report of the video provider on its
performance in meeting its customer service standards, as required by Cal.
Gov't Code § 53055.2.
      (4)   Unless a video provider is exempt under federal law from its
payment, a registration fee in an amount established by resolution of the City
Council to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and
processing the registration form.
      (5)   In addition to the registration fee specified above in division (B)
(4), the written commitment of the video provider to pay to the city, when due,
all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the city in resolving any
disputes between the video provider and its subscribers, which dispute
resolution is mandated by Cal. Gov't Code § 53088.2(o).
   (C)   The City Council may establish by ordinance a schedule of monetary
penalties for the material breach by a video provider of its obligations under
Cal. Gov't Code § 53088.2(a) through (n). As used herein, the term MATERIAL
BREACH means any substantial and repeated failure to comply with the consumer
service standards set forth in Cal. Gov't Code § 53088.2. The provisions of
that ordinance must be consistent with the provisions of Cal. Gov't Code §
53088.2. The schedule of monetary penalties may also impose a penalty, as
authorized by Cal. Gov't Code § 53056(a), for the failure of a video provider
to distribute the annual notice required by Cal. Gov't Code § 53055.1, which
penalty may not exceed $500 for each year in which the notice is not
distributed as required by state statute.
(`83 Code, § 5.48.310) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999)
§ 5.48.320 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following
provisions shall apply to wireless telecommunication facilities:
   (A)   Public rights-of-way. The provisions of
Chapter 12.52, “Wireless Telecommunications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-
Way” of Title 12, “Streets, Sidewalks and Public Places,” governing small
wireless telecommunications facilities, wireless telecommunications collocation
facilities, eligible facilities, and major wireless facilities (including but
not limited to macro-cell sites), as defined in
Chapter 12.52 of this code, shall apply to such facilities which in whole or in
part, itself or as part of another structure, rests upon, in or over the public
right-of-way, including, but not limited to, any such facility owned,
controlled, operated or managed by a telephone corporation.
   (B)   Other public property. All wireless telecommunications facilities and
wireless telecommunications collocation facilities which in whole or in part,
itself or as part of another structure, rests upon, in or over any public
property outside of a public right-of-way, shall be regulated by
Chapter 17.46, “Wireless Telecommunications and Facilities” of Title 17,
“Zoning”, of the municipal code.
   (C)   Private property. The provisions of
Chapter 17.46, “Wireless Telecommunications Facilities” of Title 17, “Zoning”,
shall apply to all wireless telecommunications facilities and wireless
telecommunications collocation facilities which in whole or in part, itself or
as part of another structure, rests upon, in, or over private property, or any
such facility owned, controlled, operated or managed by a telephone
corporation, on private property.
(`83 Code, § 5.48.320) (Ord. 99-04 § 2 (part), 1999; Ord. 2011-04 § 4, 2011;
Ord. 2021-09 § 4, 2021)
§ 5.48.330 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDED BY TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS.
   (A)   The City Council finds and determines as follows:
      (1)   The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempts and declares
invalid all state rules that restrict entry or limit competition in both local
and long distance telephone service.
      (2)   The California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) is primarily
responsible for the implementation of local telephone competition, and it
issues certificates of public convenience and necessity to new entrants that
are qualified to provide competitive local telephone exchange services and
related telecommunications service, whether using their own facilities or the
facilities or services provided by other authorized telephone corporations.
      (3)   Cal. Public Utilities Code § 234(a) defines a TELEPHONE CORPORATION
as “every corporation or person owning, controlling, operating, or managing any
telephone line for compensation within this state.”
      (4)   Cal. Public Utilities Code § 616 provides that a telephone
corporation “may condemn any property necessary for the construction and
maintenance of its telephone line.”
      (5)   Cal. Public Utilities Code § 2902 authorizes municipal corporations
to retain their powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationships
between a public utility and the general public in matters affecting the
health, convenience, and safety of the general public, including matters such
as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility and the location
of the poles, wires, mains, or conduits of any public utility on, under, or
above any public streets.
      (6)   Cal. Public Utilities Code § 7901 authorizes telephone and
telegraph corporations to construct telephone or telegraph lines along and upon
any public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or lands within
this state, and to erect poles, posts, piers, or abatements for supporting the
insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their lines, in such manner
and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway or
interrupt the navigation of the waters.
      (7)   Cal. Public Utilities Code § 7901.1 confirms the right of
municipalities to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner
in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed, which control must be
applied to all entities in an equivalent manner, and may involve the imposition
of fees.
      (8)   Cal. Gov't Code § 50030 provides that any permit fee imposed by a
city for the placement, installation, repair, or upgrading of
telecommunications facilities, such as lines, poles, or antennas, by a
telephone corporation that has obtained all required authorizations from the
CPUC and the FCC to provide telecommunications services, must not exceed the
reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged, and
must not be levied for general revenue purposes.
   (B)   In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations
and requirements set forth above in division (A) of this section, the following
regulatory provisions are applicable to a telephone corporation that desires to
provide telecommunications service by means of facilities that are proposed to
be constructed within the city's public rights-of-way:
      (1)   The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be
applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit, or a building permit
(“ministerial permit”).
      (2)   In addition to the information required by this code in connection
with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must
submit to the city the following supplemental information:
         (a)   A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity
issued by the CPUC to the applicant, and a copy of the CPUC decision that
authorizes the applicant to provide the telecommunications service for which
the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the city's public rights-of-
way.
         (b)   If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of
public convenience to operate as a competitive local carrier, the following
additional requirements are applicable:
            1.   As required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the
applicant must establish that it has timely filed with the city a quarterly
report that describes the type of construction and the location of each
construction project proposed to be undertaken in the city during the calendar
quarter in which the application is filed, which information is sufficient to
enable the city to coordinate multiple projects, as may be necessary.
            2.   If the applicant's proposed construction project will extend
beyond the utility rights-of-way into undisturbed areas or other rights-of-way,
the applicant must establish that it has filed a petition with the CPUC to
amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed
construction project has been subjected to a full-scale environmental analysis
by the CPUC, as required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.
            3.   The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed
construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures
specified in the Negative Declaration (“Competitive Local Carriers (CLCs)
Projects for Local Exchange Communication Service throughout California”) or to
the Mitigation Monitoring Plan adopted in connection with Decision No. 95-12-
057 of the CPUC. The city's issuance of a ministerial permit will be
conditioned upon the applicant's compliance with all applicable mitigation
measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone
corporations that are designated as competitive local carriers.
   (C)   In recognition of the fact that numerous excavations in the public
rights-of-way diminish the useful life of the surface pavement, and for the
purpose of mitigating the adverse impacts of numerous excavations on the
quality and longevity of public street maintenance within the city, the
following policies and procedures are adopted:
      (1)   The City Manager is directed to ensure that all public utilities,
including telephone corporations, comply with all local design, construction,
maintenance and safety standards that are contained within, or are related to,
a ministerial permit that authorizes the construction of facilities within the
public rights-of-way.
      (2)   The City Manager is directed to coordinate the construction and
installation of facilities by public utilities, including telephone
corporations, in order to minimize the number of excavations in the public
rights-of-way. In this regard, based upon projected plans for street
construction or renovation projects, the City Manager is authorized to
establish on a quarterly basis one or more construction time periods or
“windows” for the installation of facilities within the public rights-of-way.
Telephone corporations and other public utilities that submit applications for
ministerial permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may be
required to delay such construction until the next quarterly window that is
established by the city.
   (D)   The city reserves all rights that it now possesses or may later
acquire with respect to the regulation of any cable or telecommunications
service that is provided, or proposed to be provided, by a telephone
corporation. These reserved rights may relate, without limitation, to the
imposition of reasonable conditions in addition to or different from those set
forth in this Article IV, the exaction of a fee or other form of consideration
or compensation for use of public rights-of-way, and related matters; provided,
however, that such regulatory rights and authority must be consistent with
federal and state law that is applicable to cable or telecommunications
services provided by telephone corporations.

subject matter, to be invalid and in conflict with any paramount federal or

§ 5.92.010 PURPOSE.
   The primary purpose of public streets and rights-of-way is the free and
unobstructed right of travel. The city recognizes that the use of public
streets and rights-of-way for valet parking operations, while providing a
public benefit, may impede travel, interfere with rights of others using the
streets and rights-of-way, and may affect the public safety and create a public
nuisance. The city may therefore permit and restrict valet parking operations
as a special privilege, not as a matter of right. The approval of any permit
under this chapter for the use of the public right-of-way is on a temporary and
nonpermanent basis and is for a nonexclusive use of that public right-of-way.
Permittees shall have neither property interest in nor any entitlement to the
granting or continuation of any permit for the use of any public right-of-way.

   (D)   Uniformity in the type and frequency of collection services, means of
collection and transportation, type of equipment used, and the nature,
location, reporting information and extent of providing solid waste collection
services within the city are vital for compliance with statutory requirements
set forth by the Act; and

Chapter 8.08 of the Monrovia Municipal Code shall institute standards for the
establishment and maintenance of an exclusive system to provide residential
solid waste collection, recycling and disposal services; and

applicant has made a good faith effort to meet the diversion requirement, he or
she shall inform the Building Department, and shall release the performance

§ 8.10.010 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   The City Council finds and determines as follows:
   (A)   The city is empowered under California Constitution Section 7 of
Article XI to make and enforce, within its limits, all police and sanitary
ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws. The California
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 40000 et
seq.) requires the city to divert, through a combination of source reduction
and recycling programs, 50% of its solid waste from landfill disposal by the
year 2000.
   (B)   Uniformity in the type and frequency of collection services, means of
collection and transportation, type of equipment used, and the nature,
location, reporting information and extent of providing solid waste collection
services within the city are vital for compliance with statutory requirements
set forth by this legislation. Pursuant to the Cal. Public Resources Code, the
city is authorized to determine aspects of solid waste handling which are of
local concern and the means by which such services are to be rendered under
terms and conditions prescribed by the City Council by resolution or ordinance,
including the provision of commercial and industrial solid waste collection and
disposal services on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.
   (C)   Pursuant to the Cal. Public Resources Code, the City Council has
determined that public health, safety and well-being require that exclusive or
non-exclusive franchises be granted to qualified collectors for solid waste
collection, recycling and disposal services for all commercial and industrial
customers within the city not serviced under a franchise. In March, 1992, all
waste haulers servicing commercial/industrial customers in the city received a
five-year notification via certified mail that the city intended to adopt
either an exclusive or non-exclusive system in the future.

to the mandatory recycling of commercial solid waste adopted by the state shall
apply to commercial and industrial premises in the city.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of every person in possession, charge,
or control of the day-to-day activities at any commercial or industrial
premises subject to the state mandatory commercial recycling regulations to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Solid Waste Program Administrator, that
the commercial or industrial premises is in compliance with the state
regulations. The Solid Waste Program Administrator shall specify the method by
which compliance shall be demonstrated.
   (B)   The City Council shall have the right to issue notices of
noncompliance and assess fines on those commercial or industrial premises that
have been determined to be not in compliance with the state mandatory
commercial recycling regulations. The City Council shall determine the amount
of any fines imposed for noncompliance and the method by which these fines are
to be collected.
   (C)   It is the intention of the City Council that the facilities operated
by the city shall be subject to the state's mandatory commercial recycling
regulations.
   (D)   As provided for in the state mandatory commercial recycling
regulations, the City Council shall adopt procedures to exempt certain
businesses from these regulations.

be approved, approved with conditions, or denied based on the collector's
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, including the permit
application approval criteria.
   (D)   No collector permit granted pursuant to this chapter shall limit the
right of the city to grant an exclusive or non-exclusive franchise for solid
waste and recyclables collection services in the city.
(`83 Code, § 8.10.060) (Ord. 2000-26 § 1, 2000)
§ 8.10.070 COLLECTOR REQUIREMENTS.
   The following are requirements for a collector issued a solid waste and
recyclables collection permit by the city.
   (A)   (1)   Collectors shall submit a quarterly report on a form provided by
the city or in a format acceptable to the city, which reflects the solid waste,
recyclables and green waste collection and diversion activities for the
reporting quarter. The contents of this form will be prescribed by the Solid
Waste Program Administrator and shall contain information sufficient to
determine compliance with the goals, schedules, and requirements of the Act,
the city's Source Reduction and Recycling Element adopted pursuant to the Act,
and the requirements of this chapter. This information must include, but is not
limited to:
         (a)   The quantities by weight of solid waste, source separated green
waste, source separated recyclables collected, and any recyclables diverted
from loads of mixed solid waste.
         (b)   Each disposal site used during the quarter with tonnage taken to
each site.
         (c)   Each processing site used during the quarter and the tonnage
taken by the collector to each site, the amount of recyclables recovered from
the tonnage, and the amount and final disposition of any materials remaining
from the tonnage.
         (d)   Hazardous substances inadvertently collected during the quarter,
including customer address (if known), quantity and type of material, and final
disposition of hazardous substances.
         (e)   Summary report of the customer complaint log in a format
acceptable to the city.
         (f)   The total amount of quarterly gross revenues received by the
collector for providing services under the permit issued pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.
         (g)   The reporting quarter and permit-year cumulative recycling and
waste diversion rate.
      (2)   Diversion through source reduction, recycling and/or composting
activities shall be considered for the purposes of the diversion calculation.
Transformation, to the extent that the city can receive diversion credit for
transformation under the Act, shall also be considered for the purposes of the
diversion calculation. The reporting quarters shall be: January 1 through March
31; April 1 through June 30; July 1 through September 30; and October 1 through
December 31 of each year. Quarterly reports are to be filed with the Solid
Waste Program Administrator no later than 30 days after the last day of the
preceding reporting quarter. Failure to submit quarterly reports within this
time frame may result in revocation or non-renewal of the collector's permit
pursuant to §
8.10.120 of this chapter.
   (B)   Recycling and waste diversion rate for each collector shall be
calculated by taking the total number of tons of any and all materials
considered diverted or recycled from the commercial/industrial waste stream and
dividing the resulting number by the total tonnage of commercial and industrial
solid waste, recyclables, and green waste reported as being removed from
collector's commercial and industrial customers in the city. The current
quarter's recycling and waste diversion rate and a cumulative permit-year
recycling and waste diversion rate shall be calculated and reflected on the
quarterly report.
   (C)   Collectors shall keep and preserve for no less than three years
following the applicable reporting period, full, complete and accurate waste
diversion and/or recycling reports, financial and accounting records pertaining
to cash, billings and disposal transactions for the city. Such records shall
include, but not be limited to landfill tonnage receipts, weight tickets for
recyclables, transfer station receipts, waste reduction and recycling audit
data used in support of source reduction, and any other records and reports
that are necessary for the city to enforce the provisions of this chapter and
to comply with all applicable laws, including waste diversion requirements.
   (D)   Source reduction. Collector may elect to document diversion through
source reduction through the performance of waste reduction and recycling
audits of their commercial/industrial customers serviced in the city. The audit
procedures must be consistent with the diversion calculations and methodologies
of the California Integrated Waste Management Board. The costs of the audits
shall be the sole responsibility of the collector. Upon written request, all
source data collected in support of the diversion claimed through source
reduction in quarterly reports submitted to the city shall be made available
within 30 days of the date of the request. Should the collector fail to provide
the information requested to the satisfaction of the Solid Waste Program
Administrator, the collector shall be responsible for the maximum permit fees
due to the city as set forth by City Council resolution, or the collector's
permit may be revoked pursuant to the provisions of §
8.10.120 of this chapter.
   (E)   Collectors shall provide all data and statistical information that the
Solid Waste Program Administrator deems to be necessary to demonstrate
compliance with any current, federal, state, or local law, regulation, order or
permit. Such records are instrumental in the determination of the collector's
permit fees, and shall be subject to audit and inspection at the request of the
Solid Waste Program Administrator. Collectors shall be given at least 30 days'
notice of any change in reporting requirements.
   (F)   Permit fees. Collectors shall be subject to quarterly permit fees
calculated at a permit fee rate prescribed by City Council resolution. The
permit fee rate shall be applied to the total tonnage processed by a collector
for the quarterly reporting period, which originated from commercial/industrial
customers in the city and is charged against the city as disposal as defined in
the Act. Collectors achieving a diversion rate equivalent to or greater than
the diversion goals set forth in the Act shall be eligible to receive a reduced
quarterly permit fee rate. Permit fees are to be submitted to the Solid Waste
Program Administrator no later than 30 days after the last day of the preceding
reporting quarter. Collectors submitting quarterly permit fees beyond the 30-
day deadline shall be subject to permit revocation or non-renewal, pursuant to
§
8.10.120 of this chapter.
   (G)   CERCLA liability. Collector shall fully indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the city against any claim arising from or attributable to any repair,
cleanup or detoxification, or preparation and implementation of any removal,
remedial response, closure or other plan (regardless of whether undertaken due
to governmental action) concerning any hazardous substance or hazardous wastes
at any place where collector transfers, stores or disposes of solid waste
pursuant to the permit issued to the collector, or if its activities pursuant
to the permit issued to the collector result in a release of hazardous
substances into the environment. The foregoing indemnity is intended to operate
as an agreement pursuant to Section 107(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act, CERCLA, 42 USC 9607(e), and Cal.
Health and Safety Code § 25364, to protect, defend, hold harmless and indemnify
the city to the maximum extent permitted by law, including, but not limited to,
the payment of all costs, claims, liabilities, attorneys fees and costs of
suits. Collector's obligation to indemnify, defend and save harmless the city
as to environmental related liability (CERCLA liability) shall be limited to
the requirements contained in this section.
   (H)   CERCLA Liability Fund. There is hereby established a CERCLA Liability
Fund which shall be funded by a portion of each collector's quarterly permit
fees, as established by the city, and which shall be used to indemnify the city
as to any CERCLA liability, whether in the form of claims, administrative
actions, remediation or otherwise as described in division (G) of this section.
Monies deposited into this fund shall remain for no less than five years from
the date of deposit. Thereafter, any collector may make a claim for refund of
amounts paid into the fund provided: (1) no claim alleging CERCLA liability has
been asserted against the city, nor has the city determined that it is exposed
to CERCLA liability as a result of any act or omission of the collector; (2)
the collector making the claim can show to the city's satisfaction that due to
the passage of time, the closure of a dump site, or otherwise, no CERCLA
liability can lawfully be imputed to the city as of the date of the claim as a
result of the collector's acts or omissions; and (3) the claim is made in
writing not later than one year after the expiration of the five-year funding
period set forth herein. Should a claim not be made within this one-year
period, all amounts which could be claimed shall be subject to escheat to the
city in accordance with laws applicable to unclaimed funds. Nothing contained
in this section or chapter, including any monetary limit, shall in any way
limit, prevent, or otherwise alter the city's right and/or ability to bring an
action or claim for indemnity or contribution, or otherwise assert against a
collector or collectors, its right to indemnity or contribution, as provided
herein.
   (I)   Hazardous substance notifications. Collector has represented to the
city that the collector will carry out its duties to notify all agencies with
jurisdiction, including the California Department of Toxic Substances Control
and Local Emergency Response Providers, and, if appropriate, the National
Response Center, of reportable quantities of hazardous substances, found or
observed anywhere within the city, including on, in, under or about city
property, city easements, city rights-of-way and city waste containers. In
addition to other required notifications, if the collector observes any
substances which it or its employees reasonably believe or suspect to contain
hazardous wastes unlawfully disposed or released on city property, streets in
the city, storm drains, or public rights-of-way, collector also will
immediately notify the City Manager and the Los Angeles County Fire Protection
District. Notwithstanding the above, collector has no obligation to collect
hazardous substances pursuant to the collector permit issued under this
chapter.
   (J)   Solid waste disposal. The collector shall deposit all solid waste
collected in the city at landfills which have been properly permitted by the
Regional Water Quality Control Board and Local Enforcement Agency, and have
received the appropriate classification for the type of solid waste deposited.
Landfills utilized by the collector may not be listed as or be considered for
inclusion on a state or federal Superfund list. Alternatively, the collector
may deposit solid waste collected in the city at transfer stations, waste to
energy facilities or material recovery facilities, which have been properly
permitted and which are not being considered for inclusion on a state or
federal Superfund list. Upon the city's request, the collector shall have the
responsibility to furnish to city copies of permits issued for all disposal
facilities at which the collector disposes of city's waste. The collector's
failure to conduct such due diligence, or disposal of solid waste collected in
the city in violation of this section, to the extent it causes liability or
damage to the city, shall trigger the collector's obligation to indemnify the
city, including liability under CERCLA or any other applicable environmental
statutes.
   (K)   The collector shall provide and maintain all equipment used in
performance of this permit in a safe and sanitary manner, and in good operating
condition and appearance. Collection vehicles shall be registered with the
California Department of Motor Vehicles and shall be maintained so as to comply
with the standards of the California Highway Patrol. The collector shall ensure
that there is no leakage of solid waste, recyclables, or liquids from
collection vehicles. Collection vehicles and containers used for the temporary
accumulation and collection of solid waste and recyclables shall be free of
“tagging” or graffiti and shall be uniform in appearance, including same
colors, corporate logo and shall reflect the collector's name and local
telephone number in type not less than two inches in height. Every driver or
operator working on or with collection vehicles of the collector shall
immediately pick up, clean, haul away and dispose of all refuse, debris, or
litter spilled or dropped upon public or private property due to the operation
of the collector's vehicles.
   (L)   The collector shall be responsible for keeping all commercial solid
waste containers in good repair and in a clean and sanitary condition. The
collector shall remove and replace all commercial/industrial solid waste
containers, which are identified by the Director of Community Development or
his/her designee as being unsanitary or otherwise unfit for use. The collector
shall remove all containers, which are in a public right-of-way.
   (M)   The collector shall indemnify, relieve, release, defend, hold harmless
and forever discharge the city and its officers, agents, employees, attorneys,
administrators, affiliates, representatives, servants, insurers, successors,
heirs and each of them, of and from any and all claims, rights, debts,
liabilities, demands, obligations, liens, promises, acts, agreements, costs and
expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and costs), damages,
actions and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature (including without
limitation, any statutory, civil or administrative claim), whether known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, fixed or contingent, apparent or concealed,
in any way based on, arising out of or related to or connected with the
collector permit issued by the city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
except to the extent attributable to the city's own negligence or willful
misconduct. The provisions of this division (M) and all other indemnities
herein shall survive the termination or expiration of the collector's permit to
the maximum extent permitted by law.
   (N)   The collector shall carry public liability and auto insurance during
the term of the solid waste and recyclables collection permit in an amount not
less than $1,000,000 aggregate, $1,000,000 per occurrence during the permit
term. The collector additionally shall provide worker's compensation insurance
in the amount required by law for its employees or shall have been issued a
certificate to self-insure in accordance with state law. All public liability
insurance obtained by the collector shall name as additional insured the city,
its officers, agents and employees and shall require that 30 days' written
notice be given prior to the reduction or modification of the limits or
cancellation or expiration of the policy. The collector shall provide the city
with a certificate or certificates together with endorsements showing that the
required insurance will be in effect for at least 30 days in advance of the
first day the collector will perform services under the permit issued by the
city. No work shall be performed by the collector during any period when the
collector is not covered by insurance as required by this section. In the event
the collector does any work while not covered by the insurance, the city may
immediately revoke the collector's permit without providing the 30 days'
written notice required by §
8.10.120 of this chapter.
   (O)   The collector shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, its
officers, agents and employees with respect to: (1) any and all claims, losses
and liabilities whatsoever for damages of any nature occurring or resulting to
any and all persons, firms or corporations furnishing or supplying work,
services, materials, or supplies in connection with the exercise of the
collector's permit and each collector's activities thereunder; (2) any and all
claims, lawsuits, liabilities or actions arising from the issuance of the
collector permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; (3) any and all
claims, losses and liabilities for property damage, personal liabilities and/or
death arising out of or alleged to have arisen from, or connected with the
collector's performance of its obligations pursuant to the issuance of a
collector permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; and (4) any claim
or liability arising from or attributable to any alleged breach of warranty of
merchantability or fitness of purpose or other laws relating to product
liability for solid waste and recyclables collected pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter. The collector's obligation to indemnify, as required herein,
shall include payment of all attorney's fees and costs of defense.
   (P)   The collector shall comply with the city's Noise Regulations as set
forth in
Chapter 9.44 of this code.
   (Q)   The collector and any and all employees of the collector shall provide
solid waste collection service in compliance with all federal, state and local
laws and with all applicable regulations promulgated by federal, state, or
local administrative or regulatory agencies, now in force and as they may be
enacted, issued or amended during the term of the collector's permit.
   (R)   Ad hoc reports. The collector shall provide up to six reports per
calendar year of varying detail and format, as specifically requested by the
city, to meet unforeseeable information queries by the California Integrated
Waste Management Board, or other public agencies, including the city.
   (S)   Customer privacy. The collector shall strictly observe and protect the
rights of privacy of commercial/ industrial customers. Information identifying
individual commercial/industrial customers, or the composition or contents of a
commercial/industrial customer's solid waste or recyclables shall not be
revealed to any person, governmental unit, private agency or company, unless
upon the authority of a court of law, by statute, or upon valid authorization
of the commercial/industrial customer. This provision shall not be construed to
preclude the collector from preparing, participating in, or assisting in the
preparation of waste characterization studies or waste stream analyses, which
may be required to comply with the Act. The collector shall not market or
distribute outside the normal course of its business, mailing lists with the
names and addresses of commercial/industrial customers. The rights accorded
customers pursuant to this division (S) shall be in addition to any other
privacy right accorded customers pursuant to federal or state law.
   (T)   Adverse information. The collector shall provide the city two copies
of all reports, or other material adversely affecting the collector's permit
issued pursuant to this chapter, submitted by the collector to the
Environmental Protection Agency, the California Integrated Waste Management
Board or any other federal or state agency unless otherwise prohibited by law.
Copies shall be submitted to the city simultaneously with the collector's
filing of such matters with said agencies. The collector's routine
correspondence to said agencies need not be automatically submitted to the
city, but shall be made available to the city upon written request, as provided
in this section and below.
      (1)   The collector shall submit to the city copies of all pleadings,
applications, notifications, communications and documents of any kind submitted
by the collector to, as well as copies of all decisions, correspondence and
actions by, any federal, state and local courts, regulatory agencies and other
government bodies relating specifically to the collector's performance of
services pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Any confidential data
exempt from public disclosure shall be retained in confidence by the city and
its authorized agents and shall not be made available for public inspection.
      (2)   The collector shall submit to the city such other information or
reports in such forms and at such times as the city may reasonably request or
require.
      (3)   All reports and records required under this or any section of this
chapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of the collector.
   (U)   Assignment. The collector shall not assign any portion of the rights
and privileges granted under the collector permit without written consent of
the city.
   (V)   Subcontracting. The collector shall not engage any subcontractors for
collection of solid waste, green waste or recyclables without prior written
consent of the city.
(`83 Code, § 8.10.070) (Ord. 2000-26 § 1, 2000)
§ 8.10.080 FAILURE TO REPORT—LATE REPORTS—LATE PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   (1)   Collector's failure, refusal or neglect to prepare and file any
of the reports required by this chapter, or refusal to provide required
information to the city, or the inclusion of any materially false or misleading
statement or representation by the collector in such reports shall be deemed a
violation of the terms of the permit, and shall constitute cause for the Solid
Waste Program Administrator to revoke or not renew the solid waste and
recyclables collection permit issued by the city. The collector shall also be
subject to fines and all legal remedies, which are otherwise available to the
city. In addition to the revocation or non-renewal of a collector permit, a
penalty for late permit fees shall be applied in accordance with a schedule set
forth by resolution of the City Council. Reports and/or permit fees that are
submitted to the Solid Waste Program Administrator after 30 calendar days
following the end of the previous reporting quarter will result in an automatic
collector permit review by the Solid Waste Program Administrator. The collector
permit review shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   The number of times the collector has submitted quarterly
reports after the 30-day deadline in the last 12 months and the relative degree
of the delinquent submissions (e.g. 10 days late, 20 days late, and the like);
         (b)   The number of times the collector has submitted quarterly permit
fees after the 30-day deadline in the last 12 months and the relative degree of
the delinquent submission (e.g. 10 days late, 20 days late, and the like);
         (c)   The responsiveness of the collector to written requests from the
city to submit quarterly reports and/or permit fees that are past due;
         (d)   Any other file information or documentation that may reflect on
the collector's willingness and/or ability to fulfill the permit requirements
as prescribed by this chapter.
      (2)   Upon consideration of these and any other factors deemed pertinent,
the Solid Waste Administrator shall continue the collector permit term in
force, continue the collector permit term in force with conditions, or revoke
the collector permit pursuant to §
8.10.120.
   (B)   (1)   A collector whose permit is revoked or not renewed by the Solid
Waste Program Administrator may appeal the decision to the City Manager by
filing a written appeal and request for hearing in the City Clerk's Office
within 14 calendar days of the date of the written notification of denial;
provided, however, that if the 14 days expires on a date City Hall is not open
for business, then the appeal period shall be extended to the next business
day. Failure to file a timely appeal precludes the collector's option to file
an appeal. Upon the filing of a timely appeal, the City Manager shall schedule
an administrative hearing on the permit revocation or non-renewal. Notice of
the time, date and place of the administrative hearing shall be mailed to the
collector at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. The collector
shall have the option of presenting his/her case in writing by the hearing date
or presenting his/her case in person. At the hearing the City Manager shall
consider:
         (a)   The Solid Waste Program Administrator's reasons for revoking the
permit;
         (b)   The applicant's response to the Solid Waste Program
Administrator's reasons for the permit revocation;
         (c)   Any other information deemed pertinent to the appeal decision.
      (2)   The City Manager shall give the collector and/or its
representatives and any other interested persons, a reasonable opportunity to
be heard. The administrative hearing shall be informal and the rules of
evidence generally applied in judicial proceedings shall not be applicable.
Within 30 days after the date of the administrative hearing, the City Manager,
in consultation with the City Attorney, shall render a decision. The City
Manager may affirm, modify, or reverse with or without conditions the action of
the Solid Waste Program Administrator. The decision of the City Manager shall
be made in writing, shall be supported by findings and shall be final.
   (C)   Upon revocation or non-renewal of a collector's permit, the collector
shall cease to provide solid waste collection services in the city within 30
days of the date of the notice of revocation, non-renewal or appeal decision,
whichever is applicable. The collector shall be required to submit the
quarterly report and permit fees due to the city through the last day of
operations in the city.

   The City Manager, acting by and through a duly authorized officer, employee,
agent or independent contractor selected by the city, shall have the right at
all reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, to review and to audit
all financial and other records relating to waste tonnages, recyclables, and
permit fees maintained by the collector which pertain to solid waste and
recyclables collection services authorized under this permit to verify accuracy
of all records and reports made to the city. The City Manager shall establish
written procedures for such proceedings, including the standards under which
the collector shall be responsible for the cost of the audit.
(`83 Code, § 8.10.090) (Ord. 2000-26 § 1, 2000)
§ 8.10.100 COOPERATION WITH WASTE STUDIES.
   Should the city desire to conduct waste studies on recycling and diversion
practices in the commercial/industrial sector, either directly or through the
services of a consultant, the collector shall cooperate fully with the city
and/or the city's consultant in providing information deemed necessary by the
city to conduct the waste studies.
(`83 Code, § 8.10.100) (Ord. 2000-26 § 1, 2000)
§ 8.10.110 SERVICE RATES.
   No collector shall increase its rates to provide solid waste and recyclables
collection services to any commercial/industrial customer during any 12-month
period by an amount exceeding the greater of 5% or the percentage increase in
the current Consumer Price Index (CPI), per year. Should an uncontrollable
circumstance necessitate a rate increase of more than 5%, or the percent of any
CPI increase in any one year, then any commercial/industrial customer shall
have the right to discontinue service with the collector without penalty, and
enter into a service agreement with another permitted collector. Prior to any
increase in rates, the collector shall provide the commercial/industrial
customer with 30 days' prior written notice of the amount of the prospective
rate increase. Should a commercial/industrial customer request a change in the
level of service provided, the collector shall have the authority to adjust its
rates accordingly.

subject to revocation or non-renewal for cause. In addition to the grounds
provided elsewhere in this chapter, the following shall constitute a basis for
the revocation or non-renewal of a collector permit:
         (a)   When the continuance of the operations of the collector under
such permit shall be contrary to the public health, safety or well-being, or
shall be found to constitute a public nuisance;

multiple violations of any federal or state law, regulations of the California
Integrated Waste Management Board or its successor, a local law enforcement
agency, this code, or any other condition of the permit;

any fraud or deceit upon the city or any customer, or makes or uses any false,
fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the
issuance or renewal of the permit with its reporting requirements;
         (d)   If the holder of the permit becomes insolvent, unable or
unwilling to pay its debts, or a receiver/trustee is appointed to take over and
conduct the business of the permit holder whether in a receivership,
reorganization or bankruptcy proceeding;
         (e)   If the holder of the permit commits a material violation or
multiple violations of any order or ruling of any regulatory body with respect
to solid waste and recyclables collected within the city, except that such
order or ruling may be contested by appropriate proceedings conducted in good
faith, in which case no violation shall be deemed to have occurred until a
final decision adverse to the holder is entered.
      (2)   Unless otherwise noted in this chapter, the Solid Waste Program
Administrator shall provide 30 days' written notice to the collector of the
revocation or non-renewal of the solid waste and recyclables collection permit.
   (B)   (1)   A collector whose permit is revoked or not renewed by the Solid
Waste Program Administrator may appeal the decision to the City Manager by
filing a written appeal and request for hearing in the City Clerk's Office
within 14 calendar days of the date of the written notification of denial;
provided, however, that if the 14 days expires on a date City Hall is not open
for business, then the appeal period shall be extended to the next business
day. Failure to file a timely appeal precludes the collector's option to file
an appeal. Upon the filing of a timely appeal, the City Manager shall schedule

the time, date and place of the administrative hearing shall be mailed to the
collector at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. The collector
shall have the option of presenting his/her case in writing by the hearing date
or presenting his/her case in person. At the hearing the City Manager shall

         (b)   The applicant's response to the Solid Waste Program
Administrator's reasons for the permit revocation or non-renewal;

in consultation with the City Attorney, shall render a decision. The City
Manager may affirm, modify, or reverse with or without conditions, the action
of the Solid Waste Program Administrator. The decision of the City Manager
shall be made in writing, shall be supported by findings and shall be final.
   (C)   Upon revocation or non-renewal of a collector's permit, the collector

§ 8.11.010 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   Pursuant to the collector agreements by and between the city and authorized
collectors, as defined in
Chapter 8.10, the city may elect in its sole discretion to enact an exclusive
franchise for the geographic area within the city that is bounded by the south
side of Palm Avenue, the north side of Olive Avenue, the east side of Primrose
Avenue, and the west side of Ivy Avenue.
   (A)   The city is empowered under California Constitution Section 7 of
Article XI to make and enforce, within its limits, all police and sanitary
ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws; and
   (B)   The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (the “Act”
sometimes referred to as “AB 939”) requires the city to divert, through a
combination of source reduction and recycling programs, 50% of its Solid Waste
from landfill disposal by the year 2000; and
   (C)   Uniformity in the type and frequency of collection services, means of
collection and transportation, type of equipment used, and the nature,
location, reporting information and extent of providing solid waste collection
services within the city are vital for compliance with statutory requirements
set forth by the Act; and
   (D)   Pursuant to the Act, the city is authorized to determine aspects of
solid waste handling which are of local concern, and the means by which solid
waste services are to be rendered under terms and conditions prescribed by the
City Council by resolution or ordinance, including the provision of commercial
and industrial solid waste collection and disposal services on an exclusive or
non-exclusive basis; and
   (E)   
Chapter 8.10 of this code institutes standards for the establishment of an
exclusive or non-exclusive system to provide commercial and industrial solid
waste collection, recycling and disposal services; and
   (F)   The City Council of the city determines and finds that public health,
safety and well-being, aesthetic appearance and cost-efficiency require that an
exclusive franchise be granted to a qualified solid waste enterprise for
commercial and industrial solid waste collection, recycling and disposal
services for commercial and industrial customers within the franchise area.
(`83 Code, § 8.11.010) (Ord. 99-05 § 5, 1999; Ord. 2012-03 § 4, 2012)
§ 8.11.020 DEFINITIONS.
   Whenever any term used in this chapter has been defined in
Chapter 8.08 or
8.10 of this code or Cal. Public Resources Code Division 30, Part 1, Chapter 2,
the definition in this Municipal Code or the Cal. Public Resources Code shall
apply unless the term is otherwise defined in this chapter.
   BIN. A container with capacity of approximately one to eight cubic yards,
with a hinged lid, and with wheels, that is typically serviced by a front end
loading collection vehicle.
   BIN ENCLOSURES. The solid waste bin enclosures (Old Town customer owned and
those owned by the city), located within the franchise area, and used for the
temporary accumulation of solid waste, green waste and recyclable material by
Old Town customers.
   EXCLUSIVE COMMERCIAL FRANCHISE. The legal authority granted by the city to a
contractor of its choosing to collect, process and/or dispose of solid waste,
including green waste, from commercial facilities and industrial facilities
within the franchise area. The exclusive commercial franchise granted by the
city also includes collection of solid waste from the bin enclosures, but does
not include any other municipal facilities in the franchise area or any single-
family or multi-family residential properties.
   FRANCHISE AREA. Commercial facilities, industrial facilities and bin
enclosures in the geographic area in the city that is bounded by the south side
of Palm Avenue, the north side of Olive Avenue, the west side of Ivy Avenue,

   OLD TOWN CUSTOMERS. Those commercial and industrial facilities within the
scope of the exclusive commercial franchise that generate or accumulate solid
waste at a commercial or industrial facility in the franchise area.
   RATE. The charge to an Old Town customer for services provided by the person
holding the exclusive commercial franchise, subject to the ceiling on rates

§ 8.11.030 EXCLUSIVE COMMERCIAL FRANCHISE.
   The exclusive commercial franchise is intended to operate independently of,
but not in conflict with, the non-exclusive waste collection program
established in
Chapter 8.10 of this code.
   (A)   The exclusive commercial franchise is a mechanism through which the
city and Old Town customers desire to achieve a beautification of the franchise
area, a general reduction in the number of solid waste bins located along the
public right-of-way within the franchise area, and if possible, a reduction of
the cost for solid waste collection and disposal services.
   (B)   To serve these ends, and upon agreement with the city, the person
holding the exclusive commercial franchise shall collect the solid waste, and
green waste generated and accumulated by Old Town customers in solid waste bins
located in the franchise area, including bins located in the bin enclosures,
and those other locations specified in the contract or franchise by and between
the city and the person holding the exclusive commercial franchise.
   (C)   The person holding the exclusive commercial franchise may alter levels
of solid waste collection and disposal service provided to Old Town customers
upon agreement with the Old Town customers.
   (D)   In the event a dispute regarding a change in the level of service or
other such issue arises between the person holding the exclusive commercial
franchise and an Old Town customer, and such dispute cannot be resolved between
the parties, then the City Manager shall hear and arbitrate the matter.

   Every person in possession of or having control over the day-to-day
activities at a commercial or industrial facility located within the franchise
area shall ensure that solid waste containers or bins shall not be located on
the public right-of-way nor visible from the public right-of-way.
   (A)   The city’s Development Review Committee, in its sole discretion, may

   (B)   The city’s Development Review Committee shall have the authority to
determine the degree to which Old Town customers not utilizing the bin
enclosures must screen solid waste containers and bins from the public right-
of-way. In instances where Old Town customers must construct walls, gates,

   ABANDONED STRUCTURE. A building or other structure that is vacant and is
maintained in a condition of disrepair or deterioration, as discernible from a
public right-of-way or adjoining real property. Factors that may also be
considered in a determination of an abandoned structure include, without
limitation: present operability and functional utility; the presence of non-
functional, broken or missing doors or windows, such that entry therein by
unauthorized persons is not deterred; the existence of real property tax
delinquencies for the land upon which the structure is located; age and degree
of obsolescence of the structure, and the cost of rehabilitation or repair
versus its market value.
   ABANDONED PERSONAL PROPERTY.  Any item, object, thing, material or substance
that, by its condition of damage, deterioration, disrepair, nonuse,
obsolescence or location on public real property or on private real property,
causes a reasonable person to conclude that the owner has permanently
relinquished all right, title, claim and possession thereto, or that the
object, thing, material or substance cannot be used for its intended or
designed purpose. Abandoned personal property may include junk and vehicles.
   ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE. Any condition, device, equipment, instrument, item or

dangerous to inquisitive minors. An attractive nuisance shall also include
pools, standing water or excavations containing water, that are unfenced or
otherwise lack an adequate barrier thereby creating a risk of drowning, or

algae, insect remains, animal remains, rubbish, refuse, debris, or waste of any
kind.

violate or are contrary to any provision of the code, are public nuisances by
definition and declaration, and said enumerated conditions shall not, in any
manner, be construed to be exclusive or exhaustive. A public nuisance shall
also exist when a person fails to comply with any condition of a city approval,
entitlement, license or permit or when an activity on, or use of, real property
violates, or is contrary to, any provision or requirement of the code.
   RESPONSIBLE PERSON. Any person, whether as an owner as defined in this

obligate the city to abate a public nuisance.
(Ord. 2007-20 § 2 (part), 2007)

city officials to issue alternative written or oral notices of code violations
to responsible persons or to cause the abatement of public nuisances in a
different manner, including without limitation, by court orders arising from

   (A)   As an alternative to the procedure contained in §
8.12.200, the city may cause a nuisance abatement lien to be recorded upon real
property upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code, §
38773.1, and future amendments thereto, in the event a Statement of Abatement
Costs or a confirmed Statement of Abatement Costs is not paid in a timely
manner.
   (B)   A lien shall not be recorded prior to serving the owner of record of
the parcel of land on which the public nuisance is maintained, with a notice.
This document shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action
in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of
Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record, after
diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and
publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
county in which the property is located pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 6062.
   (C)   The nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the County Recorder's
office in the county in which the parcel of land is located and from the date
of recording shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien.
   (D)   A nuisance abatement lien authorized by this section shall specify the
amount of the lien for the city, the name of the city department on whose
behalf the lien is imposed, the date of the abatement actions, the street
address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which
the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the
parcel.
   (E)   In the event that the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied,
either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the
information specified in division (D) shall be recorded by the city. A nuisance
abatement lien and the release of the lien shall be indexed in the grantor-
grantee index.
   (F)   A nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by
the city for a money judgment.
   (G)   The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred
regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the
property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.
   (H)   The amount of a nuisance abatement lien shall also constitute a
personal obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance was
abated.
(Ord. 2007-20 § 2 (part), 2007)
§ 8.12.220 TREBLE THE COSTS OF ABATEMENT.

nuisance pursuant to this chapter, the court may order that person to pay
treble the costs of the abatement.

violation of any provision of the Monrovia Municipal Code and said violation

corrected” includes the procurement of all required city approvals, permits,
licenses and the passage of all city required inspections.
   (B)   The city may record a notice of substandard property without the

violation to a responsible person previously disclosed that a substandard
notice may be recorded against a property if a violation is not fully abated or
corrected in a period of 30 days.
   (C)   A notice of substandard property may be recorded 30 days after service
of a notice of abatement provided that:
      (1)   The notice contained this disclosure;

period, and
      (3)   A timely and proper appeal to the notice of abatement was not made.

order of abatement provided that:
      (1)   The order of abatement contained this disclosure; and

as hereafter defined. Such fees shall not exceed the amount reasonably required
to achieve this objective and are chargeable whether the city’s code
enforcement actions occur in the absence of formal administrative or judicial
proceedings, as well as prior to, during, or subsequent to, the initiation of
such proceedings.
   (B)   The amount(s) or rate(s) of code enforcement fees for city personnel
time and other resources that are used for code enforcement actions shall be
established, and may thereafter be amended, by resolution by the City Council.
   (C)   The City Manager, or a designee thereof, is authorized to adopt
regulations for the uniform imposition of code enforcement fees, and for
related administrative actions pertaining to such fees.
   (D)   The fees imposed pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any
other fees or charges that responsible persons may owe in accordance with any
other provision of the code, or which are imposed pursuant to county, state or
federal laws or regulations.
   (E)   Code enforcement fees shall be recoverable in conjunction with any
civil, administrative or criminal action to abate, cause the abatement, or
cessation of, or otherwise remove, a violation or a public nuisance.
   (F)   Failure to pay code enforcement fees shall constitute a debt that is
collectible in any manner allowed by law.
   (G)   As used in this section, the following words or phrases shall have the
following definitions:
      CODE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. Shall mean and include, but not be limited to,
the time and other resources of public officials expended by them in
identifying, inspecting, investigating, seeking or causing the abatement of a
violation at a residential structure. These include, but are not limited to,
site inspections, drafting reports, taking photographs, procuring other
evidence, engaging in meetings, conferences and communications with responsible
persons, their agents or representatives, concerning a violation, as well as
with attorneys for the City at any time, and appearances before judicial
officers or reviewing authorities during the pendency of a judicial or
administrative proceeding and other appearances at such judicial or
administrative hearings. The time and resources that public officials further
expend to confirm that a residential structure remains free of a violation
while a responsible person is on probation to a court or when a matter
concerning a residential structure remains pending before a reviewing authority
in an administrative action, shall also constitute code enforcement actions.
      RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES. Shall mean and include all structures and
premises that are regulated by the California State Housing Law [Cal. Health
and Safety Code, Division 13, Part 1.5, Section 17910 et seq.], and any future
amendments thereto. These include, but are not limited to, apartment houses,
hotels, motels, and dwellings, and residential buildings and structures
accessory thereto.
      VIOLATION.  A public nuisance as described or referred to in this
chapter, or any condition, activity or use that is caused, allowed to exist, or
maintained (whether due to an affirmative act, or inaction) by a responsible
person in violation of any other provision, regulation, or requirement of the
code, or any applicable county state or federal laws or regulations.
(Ord. 2007-20 § 2 (part), 2007)
§ 8.12.250 RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY’S FEES.
   (A)   A prevailing party in any administrative, civil or equitable judicial
action to abate, or cause the abatement of a public nuisance as defined in Part
1 of this chapter, or in any appeal or other judicial action arising therefrom,
may recover reasonable attorney’s fees in accordance with the following
subsections:
      (1)   Attorney’s fees are not recoverable by any person as a prevailing
party unless the City Manager, or a designee thereof, or an attorney for, and
on behalf of, the city, elects in writing to seek recovery of the city’s
attorney’s fees at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding.
Failure to make such an election precludes any entitlement to, or award of,
attorney’s fees in favor of any person or the city.
      (2)   The city is the prevailing party when an administrative or judicial
determination is made or affirmed by which a person is found to be responsible
for one or more conditions or activities that constitute a public nuisance. A
person is the prevailing party only when a final administrative or judicial
determination completely absolves that person of responsibility for all
conditions or activities that were alleged, in that action or proceeding, to
constitute a public nuisance. An administrative or judicial determination that
results in findings of responsibility and non-responsibility on the part of a
person for conditions or activities that were alleged in that action or
proceeding to constitute a public nuisance, shall nevertheless result in the
city being the prevailing party.
   (B)   Provided that the city has made an election to seek attorney’s fees,
an award of attorney’s fees to a person shall not exceed the amount of
reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the city in that action or proceeding.
(Ord. 2007-20 § 2 (part), 2007)
§ 8.12.260 APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS.
   (A)   This chapter does not exclusively regulate the conditions and use of
property within the city. This chapter shall supplement other provisions of
this code and other statutes, ordinances or regulations now existing or
subsequently enacted by the city, the state or any other entity or agency
having jurisdiction.
   (B)   The procedures for abatement set forth in this chapter are not
exclusive and are in addition to any other provisions set forth in this code or
by state law for the abatement of public nuisances.
(Ord. 2007-20 § 2 (part), 2007)
§ 8.12.270 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
chapter is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional
or otherwise invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this chapter. The City Council declares that it would
have adopted this chapter, and each section, subsection, sentence, clause,
phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more
sections, subsections, phrases, or portions be declared invalid or
unconstitutional.

§ 8.13.010 FINDINGS AND DECLARATION.
   The accumulation of wrecked, dismantled or abandoned shopping carts, or
parts thereof, on public and private property is found to create a condition

for their patrons. Therefore, pursuant to Cal. Business & Professions Code §

and the presence of wrecked, dismantled or abandoned shopping carts, or parts
thereof, on property located outside the premises or parking lot of the
business that provided such cart, shall be cause to institute impoundment and

§ 8.14.010 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   It is the objective of this chapter to promote and protect the public
health, safety and welfare by recognizing that hazardous conditions exist
within the city that could cause a fire, or provide a ready fuel supply to
augment the spread or intensity of a fire. It is the intent of this chapter to
provide minimum standards to safeguard life, safety, property and public
welfare by ensuring that hazardous vegetation and other hazardous conditions in
the city are prevented or promptly abated.
(Ord. 2007-22 § 4 (part), 2007)
§ 8.14.020 DEFINITIONS.

accessories, apparatus, appliances, and equipment installed as a part thereof.
   DEFENSIBLE SPACE. The area around building or structures that assist fire
department operations in their defense during a brush fire. DEFENSIBLE SPACE
also assists in preventing a single unit structure fire from spreading to
natural exposed hazardous vegetation. In a “very high fire severity zone,”
DEFENSIBLE SPACE shall equal Zone “1” and Zone “2.” In areas in the city that
are outside of the “very high fire severity zone,” DEFENSIBLE SPACE shall equal
Zone “1” unless this area is extended in writing by the Fire Chief, or a
designee thereof, because of the degree of “natural vegetation,” or “ornamental
vegetation” that is present, or for other physical conditions on a parcel of
property, or on adjoining areas.
   HAZARDOUS VEGETATION. Trees, plants, weeds and all other forms of vegetation
that, due to their properties, condition and/or location, provide a ready fuel
supply to augment the spread or intensity of a fire, or which may otherwise
constitute a danger to public health, safety or welfare. HAZARDOUS VEGETATION
also means and includes any condition involving vegetation in the city that
violates any provision of this chapter.
   NATURAL VEGETATION. Native and naturalized species of plants and other forms
of vegetation that commonly, but not exclusively, grow wild and untended on
undeveloped hillsides and parcels within the city. This plant vegetation, which
is often dry and shrubby in form, is very combustible due to its high oil
content and includes, but is not limited to, sumac, buckwheat and sages.
   ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION. All vegetation that is not “natural vegetation.”
ornamental vegetation includes purchased and/or introduced plants, bushes,
grass and trees that require irrigation, including, but not limited to,
flammable vegetation such as acacia, cedar, cypress, eucalyptus, juniper, pine
and pampas grass.
   OWNER. Any person having legal title to, or who leases, rents, occupies or
has charge, control or possession of, any real property in the city, including
all persons shown as owners on the last equalized assessment roll of the County
Assessor’s Office. Owners include persons with powers of attorney, executors of

liability company, association, joint venture or other organization or entity,
however formed, as well as trustees, heirs, executors, administrators, or
assigns, or any combination of such persons. PERSON also includes any public
entity or agency that acts as an owner in the city.
   PROPERTY or PREMISES. Any privately-owned real property, or improvements
thereon, or portions thereof, as the case may be. PROPERTY includes any parkway

chapter, or otherwise, that allows, causes, creates, maintains, or permits a
public nuisance, or any violation of the code or county or state law, or
regulation thereof, to exist or continue, by any act or the omission of any act
or duty. A responsible person shall also include employees, principals, joint
venturers, officers, agents, and/or other persons acting in concert with, or at
the direction of, and/or with the knowledge and/or consent of the owner and/or
occupant of the lot, building or structure on, or in which, a public nuisance
or violation exists or existed. The actions or inactions of a responsible
person’s agent, employee, representative or contractor may be attributed to
that responsible person.

largest shrub. As an example, a Sumac having a diameter of ten feet shall have
a separation distance of 30 feet from any other form of shrub that constitutes
natural vegetation.
   (B)   Ornamental vegetation.
      (1)   In all areas of the city, existing ornamental vegetation consisting
of highly flammable plants and trees, including, but not limited to, acacia,
cedar, cypress, eucalyptus, juniper, pine and pampas grass, shall, except on
hillsides with a grade of 70% or more, be maintained in such a manner that they
do not form a means of transmitting fire and shall be maintained a minimum of

a means of transmitting fire from native growth to buildings or structures.
         (b)   Ornamental vegetation consisting of cultivated ground cover such
as green grass, ivy, succulents or similar plants, are permissible in Zone 1
provided that they are maintained in a condition that does not form a means of
transmitting fire from native vegetation to a building or structure.
   (C)   Tree maintenance. In all areas of the city, the requirements for “tree
maintenance,” as defined in this chapter, shall be complied with at all times.
   (D)   Storage on residentially zoned properties.

shall be not be placed or stored in Zone 1 on any property in the very high
fire severity zone.
      (2)   Plant and tree cuttings shall be removed from all properties in the
city and recycled or lawfully disposed of, unless retained for composting. In
this event, such cuttings, whether in a container or otherwise, shall be placed
or stored a minimum of 30 feet from any building, structure or access roadway
in Zone 1. This requirement does not apply to green waste containers that are
to be emptied by a city approved waste contractor.
   (E)   Modification of requirements. If the Fire Chief determines that very
steep terrain, substantial danger of erosion, or other unique circumstances
make strict compliance with the provisions of this section impossible, the Fire
Chief may modify such regulations in writing for a particular property. Any
such modification only applies for the calendar year in which it is made,
unless the Fire Chief states in writing that it shall remain in effect for a
successive year or years.
   (F)   Primary and secondary responsible persons.
      (1)   Persons owning, leasing, controlling, operating, or maintaining
buildings or structures are primarily responsible for establishing and
maintaining defensible space around their buildings and structures. In the very
high fire severity zone, this obligation extends to adjoining public and
private lands that may be, or are, within Zones 1 and 2 of a responsible
person’s buildings or structures.
      (2)   Persons owning, leasing, controlling, operating, or maintaining
adjoining land that comes within Zone 1 and Zone 2 of another person’s building
or structure in the Very High Fire Severity Zone are secondary responsible
persons. Such persons who authorize primary responsible persons, or their
agents, to enter their property in order to create defensible space, and this
action is properly and promptly completed as determined by the Fire Chief, or a
designee thereof, will have discharged their obligation under this section.
Such persons who refuse or fail to authorize primary responsible persons, or
their agents, to enter their property in order to create defensible space in a
timely manner as determined by the Fire Chief, or a designee thereof, shall
have concurrent liability with primary responsible persons for failing to
comply with the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   In the event adjoining land is public property, a primary
responsible person shall obtain an encroachment permit from the city prior to
creating defensible space on said property.

VENDING GOODS OR DISTRIBUTING HANDBILLS ON STREETS, PARKING LOTS, OR PRIVATE
PROPERTY
Sections:
   
8.32.010   Necessity of regulation.
   
8.32.020   Definitions.
   
8.32.030   Specified practices prohibited.

§ 8.32.010 NECESSITY OF REGULATION.
   (A)   The City Council does hereby find and determine that the city is
confronted with serious and unique traffic problems.
   (B)   The city is primarily a residential community, surrounded by other
residential, business, manufacturing and recreational centers. This fact,
coupled with the presence of large centers of entertainment in the midst of and
in close proximity to the city causes vehicular traffic to, from, through and
within the city at times to attain dimensions totally disproportionate to the
size and population of the city. On frequent occasions thousands of motor
vehicles enter or pass through portions of the city within an hour, with the
result that abnormal traffic problems result which can not be met or solved by
the mere increase in law enforcement personnel. Any hindrance of the flow of
such vehicular traffic causes delay, traffic congestion, accidents and imminent
peril to both life and property within the city. The sale of any commodity from
a vehicle or to a person in a vehicle on any major traffic artery in the city
peculiarly adds to the local traffic congestion, delay and hazard to life and
property. Strict enforcement of traffic laws alone is insufficient to cope with
the situation. It is not possible to employ sufficient police officers
adequately to control such unique traffic problems, not only because of the
present manpower shortage, but particularly because of the fluctuating volume
of such vehicular traffic.
   (C)   The City Council further finds and determines that there is an
increasingly severe problem of litter in public and private parking lots caused
by the indiscriminate and uncontrolled distribution of handbills, primarily
those affixed to unattended motor vehicles parked in such lots. The litter
resulting from such distribution is both unsightly and annoying to adjacent
business owners and the general public. Although the Council intends by this
chapter to prohibit placement of handbills and other similar materials on
unattended vehicles parked in public or private parking lots, the Council finds
that there is an abundance of alternative methods of distributing such
materials available to those who wish to do so.
   (D)   It is therefore necessary to remove and prevent, so far as is
possible, all factors which contribute to or cause any interference with or
retardation of the movement of vast numbers of motor vehicles in the city.
(`83 Code, § 8.32.010) (Ord. 87-23 § 2, 1987)
§ 8.32.020 DEFINITIONS.

service, excluding, however, advertising matter included with mail delivery and
any newspaper eligible for entry as second-class matter under the provisions of
the United States Post Office regulations, and other regulations and statutes
of the United States.
   PRIVATE PROPERTY. Any parcel of real property within the City of Monrovia,
including any improvements thereon, and not dedicated to use by the public.
   STREET. Any and every public thoroughfare, way, street, alley, highway,
curb, sidewalk and parkway, if any, adjacent thereto, and any public property
bordering upon such thoroughfare, way, street, alley and highway.

unattended for any period of time. The term shall not include:

to is so maintained when the person distributing such advertising matter has

emergencies or natural disasters;
      (2)   Delays in obtaining discretionary permits or other government

§ 9.46.010 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that parties or gatherings at private residences as
well as gatherings at bars, restaurants and other commercial establishments
open to the public within the city may, on occasion, disturb the public peace,
safety and welfare thereby requiring law enforcement services over and above
those normally provided. It is in the best interests of the public safety,
welfare, and convenience of the city as well as in fairness to its citizens
that the city require those persons utilizing or requiring law enforcement
services beyond those provided the public at large to defray the city's expense
for providing the same.

§ 9.46.020 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   When a party, gathering or other assemblage of persons occurs on
private property and is determined by a police officer at the scene to
constitute a violation of the California Penal Code or is otherwise a threat to
the public peace, health, safety or welfare due to the magnitude of the crowd,
noise or disturbance or unruly behavior generated by the gathering, excessive
traffic, or destruction of property, then the officer shall take such actions
and give such direction as is necessary to abate the violation or condition.
The officer shall advise the responsible party, in a written notice and orally,
that if additional law enforcement personnel are required to abate the
condition, that the responsible party and/or property owner shall be held
responsible for the cost of providing such services pursuant to this chapter.
Direction shall be given to the person responsible for the event or on whose
property it is located. If the condition is not voluntarily abated or if it
nevertheless becomes necessary to call in additional police personnel in order
to terminate the gathering, quell any disturbance, direct traffic, cite
illegally parked vehicles or otherwise respond to the situation, then the cost
of such additional law enforcement services beyond the initial response shall
be reimbursed to the city as provided in §
9.46.030.
   (B)   If the Police Department issues more than three such written notices
to any one address within six months of issuance of the written notice
prescribed in division (A) of this section, the responsible party and/or
property owner shall reimburse the city for the costs of providing law
enforcement services for the fourth and each succeeding response to the
location for the activities described in division (A) within such six-month
period as provided in this division (B).

9.46.020 or on whose property the gathering is held, or if such person is a
minor then the parents or legal guardians of the minor, shall be jointly and
severally liable for all of the following costs attributable to the event:
      (1)   The actual cost to the city of law enforcement services beyond the
initial response by a police officer necessary to abate the conditions
described in §
9.46.020;
      (2)   Damage to public property resulting from such law enforcement
response;
      (3)   Injuries to law enforcement personnel incurred in such law
enforcement response; and
      (4)   Administrative costs incurred by the city in connection with the
billing and collection of such costs.
   (B)   The Police Department shall accurately compute the cost to the city of
providing such services and advise the City Manager of such costs, as well as
any other costs of damage to public property, or injuries to personnel
resulting from the law enforcement response. The person responsible for the
event as above described shall be billed for these costs by the Finance
Department and payment shall be due and payable within 15 days of the billing
date. Should the amount of the bill not be paid when due, the city may collect
the debt, as well as any costs incurred in collecting the debt due to
nonpayment, pursuant to any available provision of the law.

§ 9.47.010 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that the majority of burglar, robbery and fire alarms
to which the Police Department and Fire Department respond are false. Responses
to these false alarms result in a substantial waste of municipal resources. The
fact that such a large percentage of the alarms are false may also lull public
safety personnel into a sense of false security or reduced urgency in dealing
with alarm calls. Further, the danger to citizens created by emergency
responses to false alarms should be minimized. It is in the best interests of
the public safety, welfare, and convenience of the city as well as in fairness
to its citizens that the city require those persons generating an unusual
number of false alarms to be deterred from permitting their alarm systems to
generate the false alarms and to defray the city's expense for responding to
those false alarms.
(`83 Code, § 9.47.010) (Ord. 92-17 § 1 (part), 1992)

   (A)   If an operator or registered owner contests a parking citation or a
notice of delinquent parking violation, the processing agency shall do all of
the following:
      (1)   (a)   First, either investigate with its own records and staff or
request that the issuing agency investigate the circumstances of the citation
with respect to the contestant's written explanation of the reason or reasons
for contesting the parking citation.
         (b)   If, based on the results of that investigation, the processing
agency is satisfied that the violation did not occur or that the registered
owner was not responsible for the violation by virtue of having sold, rented or
leased the vehicle, or because legally supportable or mitigating circumstances
as set forth in the administrative policy warrant a dismissal, the processing
agency shall cancel the parking citation, and make an adequate record of the
reason or reasons for canceling the parking citation. The processing agency
shall mail the results of the investigation by first-class mail to the
contestant within ten days of the decision;
      (2)   If the contestant is not satisfied with the results of the
investigation provided for in division (A)(1) of this section, the contestant
may, within 15 days of the mailing of the results of the initial investigation,
deposit the amount of the parking penalty and other related fees or provide
proof of inability to deposit the parking penalty, and request an
administrative review;
      (3)   If the contestant prevails at the administrative hearing, then the
full amount of the parking penalty deposited shall be refunded.
   (B)   The administrative review procedure shall consist of the following:
      (1)   The contestant shall make a written request for administrative
review on a form and in a manner satisfactory to the processing agency and may
request to contest the parking citation either in person or by written
declaration;
      (2)   If the contestant is a minor, that person shall be permitted to
appear at a hearing or admit responsibility for a parking citation without the
necessity of the appointment of a guardian. The processing agency may proceed
against the minor in the same manner as if the minor were an adult;
      (3)   The administrative review shall be conducted before a hearing
examiner.
   (C)   The issuing officer shall not be required to participate in an
administrative review. The issuing agency shall not be required to produce any
evidence other than the parking citation, or copy thereof, and information
received from the Department identifying the registered owner of the vehicle.
This documentation in proper form shall be considered prima facie evidence of
the violation.
   (D)   The processing agency's final decision shall be in writing and
delivered personally to the contestant or the contestant's agent, or delivered
by first-class mail within ten working days following the hearing.
   (E)   If the contestant is not the registered owner of the vehicle, all
notices to the contestant required under this section shall also be given to
the registered owner by first-class mail.

other measures may be taken for the collection of the judgment as are
authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments entered against a
defendant in an action on a debt.
      (2)   The processing agency shall send notice by first-class mail to the
registered owner or renter, lessee, or sales transferee indicating that a civil
judgment has been filed and the date that the judgment shall become effective.
The notice shall also indicate that: execution may be levied against that
person's assets, that liens may be placed against that person's property, that

public nuisances, the City Council hereby makes the following findings and

plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to the health and safety and general welfare. Therefore, the
presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts

nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this

number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.

subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the City Council shall not assess the
costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon
which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from
such owner of the land.

fronting upon that portion of the street along which it is proposed to excavate
or to remove soil or gravel.
   (E)   The making of all excavations in and the removal of all soil or gravel

is so installed, constructed or maintained. No such tank shall be of a size
sufficient to contain more than 2,500 gallons, and shall be used only for the

be at once removed from such alley by the person owning, having charge of or
using such tank. If at any time it becomes necessary to construct any sewer,
water main, or other pipeline or conduit, or other public work of any kind

authority necessary to control discharges to and from those portions of the MS4
over which it has jurisdiction as required by the Municipal NPDES Permit, and
thereby fully and timely comply with the terms of the Municipal NPDES Permit.
   (D)   This chapter also sets forth requirements for the construction and
operation of certain “commercial development,” “new development” and
“redevelopment” and other projects (as further defined herein) which are
intended to ensure compliance with the storm water mitigation measures
prescribed in the current version of the Municipal NPDES Permit, a copy of
which is on file in the office of the City Clerk.
   (E)   This chapter authorizes the authorized enforcement officer to define
and adopt applicable best management practices (BMPs) and other storm water
pollution control measures, to grant emergency self-waivers from Municipal
NPDES Permit requirements, as provided herein in order to conduct repairs of
essential public service systems and infrastructure in emergency situations, to
cite infractions and to impose fines pursuant to this chapter. This chapter
also authorizes the authorized enforcement officer to carry out inspections,

§ 12.36.100 PLANNING AND LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW
DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT - LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Objective. The provisions of this section establish requirements for
construction activities and facility operations of Development and
Redevelopment projects to comply with the current Municipal NPDES Permit (Order
No. R4-2012-0175), to lessen the water quality impacts of development by using
smart growth practices, and to integrate LID practices and standards for storm
water pollution mitigation through means of infiltration, evapotranspiration,
biofiltration, and rainfall harvest and use. LID shall be inclusive of new
development and/or redevelopment requirements.
   (B)   Scope. This section contains requirements for storm water pollution
control measures in development and redevelopment projects and authorizes the
city to further define and adopt storm water pollution control measures, and to
develop LID principles and requirements, including but not limited to the
objectives and specifications for integration of LID strategies, grant
alternative compliance measures from the LID requirements for projects that
demonstrate technical infeasibility to retain the Storm Water Quality Design
Volume (SWQDv) on-site or where an opportunity exists for regional groundwater
replenishment as defined in the Municipal NPDES Permit, and collect funds for
projects that are granted alternative compliance measures. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the city shall administer, implement and enforce the
provisions of this section.
   (C)   Applicability. This section applies to the following new development
and redevelopment projects that are subject to city conditioning and approval
for the design and implementation of post-construction controls and other BMPs
to mitigate storm water pollution, prior to completion of the project(s), as
follows:
      (1)   New development projects.
         (a)   All development projects equal to one acre or greater of

12.44.010. Trees classified as small shall be spaced at least 30 feet apart;
those classified as medium shall be spaced at least 40 feet apart; and those
classified as large shall be spaced at least 50 feet apart. If the Director of
Public Works approves the planting of a species that is not set forth in §
12.44.010, the Director shall determine the appropriate spacing requirement
based on the size of the tree. Where existing neighboring trees fall in
different size classifications, the spacing requirement for the larger tree
shall govern. A smaller spacing distance may be approved by the Director of
Public Works.
   (B)   The distance trees may be planted from curblines and sidewalks shall
be determined by the size classification of the species set forth in §
12.44.010 of this code. Trees classified as small shall be planted at least two
feet from any curb or sidewalk; those classified as medium shall be planted at
least three feet from any curb or sidewalk; and those classified as large shall
be planted at least four feet from any curb or sidewalk.

will benefit the public, or serve a public purpose and will not be detrimental
to the health, safety, or welfare of the public and will not interfere with the
rights or welfare of owners of adjacent or abutting property, the Director

conditions or limitations imposed thereon to assure the elimination or
avoidance of adverse effects. If at any time the Director determines that the
encroachment has become detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the
city, or that the public welfare would be served by removal of the
encroachment, or that a public works project requires removal of the
encroachment, the encroachment permit shall be revoked by the City Manager upon
giving the permittee five days written notice thereof.

§ 12.52.010 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a uniform and comprehensive
set of standards and procedures to regulate the location, placement,
installation, height, appearance, and operation of wireless telecommunications
antennas and related facilities (“wireless telecommunications facilities” or
“WTFs”) in city-owned or leased public rights-of-way (PROW), consistent with
city laws, applicable state and federal requirements, and changing technology.
The regulations are intended to provide for the appropriate development of
wireless telecommunications facilities within the PROW to meet the needs of
residents, business-owners, and visitors while protecting public health and
safety and preventing visual blight and degradation of the community’s
aesthetic character and scenic vistas.
   (B)   The procedures set forth in this chapter are intended to permit WTFs
in the PROW that are tailored to the type of wireless telecommunication
facility that is sought. Collocation of facilities are preferred and
encouraged, subject to all other provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   This chapter is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or
applied to:
      (1)   Prohibit or effectively prohibit any wireless service provider’s
ability to provide wireless telecommunications services;
      (2)   Prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity’s ability to provide
any interstate or intrastate wireless telecommunications service, subject to
any competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory rules, regulations or other
legal requirements for rights-of-way management;
      (3)   Unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally
equivalent services;
      (4)   Deny any request for authorization to place, construct or modify
WTFs on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the
extent that such WTFs comply with the FCC’s regulations concerning such
emissions;
      (5)   Prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny
under federal or California state law; or
      (6)   Otherwise authorize the city to preempt any applicable federal or
state law.
   (D)   Due to rapidly changing technology and regulatory requirements, and to
further implement this chapter, the Director may adopt policies, procedures and
forms consistent with this chapter, which shall be posted on the city’s website
and maintained at the Department for review, inspection and copying by
applicants and other interested members of the public. The Director may update
the rules, policies, procedures and forms in his/her discretion to adjust for
new technologies, federal and/or state regulations, and/or to improve and
adjust the city’s implementing regulatory procedures and requirements, and
compliance therewith is a condition of approval of every wireless
telecommunications facility permit (WFTP).

shall review the application, pertinent information and documentation in
accordance with §
12.52.080. An application for a SWFP shall be approved if the Director makes
all of the findings required by §
12.52.090 of this chapter. The Director’s decision shall be issued in writing
in accordance with the procedures and conditions set forth in §§
12.52.080 and
12.52.100. The Director may impose additional conditions on the permit relating
to time, place and manner pursuant to §
12.52.070.
   (E)   Eligible facilities in PROW. Unless specifically exempt by federal or
state law, any application for the installation or modification of a WTF within
or on the PROW that constitutes an “eligible facilities request” within the
meaning of Section 6409(a) shall require the approval of an eligible facility
permit (EFP) by the Director in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter and the city’s rules and guidelines prior to deployment of the eligible
facility.
   (F)   Major wireless facilities (MWFs) in the PROW. Unless specifically
exempt by federal or state law, any application for the installation or

permit, subject to compliance with all other requirements of this chapter.
Maintenance and repairs include, but are not limited to, those minor
modifications that result from an emergency. The upgrade or any other
replacement of existing facilities and all new antennas, structures, and other
facilities, including but not limited to, those resulting from an emergency,
shall comply with the SWFP, WTCF, EFP, or MWF requirements of this chapter.
   (I)   Other permits required. In addition to any permit that may be required
under this section, the applicant must obtain all other required prior permits
or other approvals from other city departments, or state or federal agencies.
Any permit granted under this chapter shall also be subject to the conditions
and/or requirements of all such other required city, state or federal prior
permits or other approvals.
   (J)   Eligible applicants. Only applicants who have been granted the right
to enter the PROW pursuant to state or federal law, or who have entered into a
franchise or license agreement with the city permitting them to use the PROW,
shall be eligible to construct, install, modify or otherwise deploy a WTF in
the PROW.
   (K)   Speculative equipment or facilities prohibited. The city finds that
the practice of “pre-approving” wireless communications equipment or other
improvements that the applicant does not presently intend to install but may
wish to install at some undetermined future time does not serve the public’s
best interest. The city shall not approve any equipment or other improvements
in connection with a WTFP when the applicant does not actually and presently
intend to install such equipment or construct such improvements.
   (L)   Prohibited facilities. Any WTFP that does not comply with the most
current regulatory and operational standards and regulations (including, but
not limited to RF emission standards) adopted by the FCC is prohibited.

within the meaning of an eligible facility request unless the applicant
demonstrates that it cannot feasibly achieve its power needs with batteries,
natural gas powered generators, fuel cells, solar or other similarly non-
polluting, low noise-level means due to commercial impracticability, actual
unavailability, and inability of alternative means to feasibly achieve the
power needs of the facility.
         (d)   All related ministerial permits and compliance with applicable
Construction Codes and other health and safety standards shall be required for
any application for deployment of a new generator or replacement or
modification of an existing generator, as determined to be necessary by the
Director.
      (2)   Major wireless facilities.

§ 12.52.050 APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section sets forth the application submittal
requirements for all permits required by this chapter. These requirements may
be augmented by rules and guidelines adopted by resolution of the City Council.
The Director also may augment the provisions of this section and any rules and
guidelines to further implement these provisions by the adoption of written
rules that are posted on the city’s website. The purpose of this section is, in
part, to ensure that this chapter is implemented to the full extent permitted
by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 6409(a), the Declaratory Ruling
and Third Report and Order adopted by the FCC entitled In the Matter of
Accelerating Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to
Infrastructure Investment, 83 FR 51867-01 (published in the Federal Register on
October 15, 2018) [hereinafter “Report and Order”], the final rule adopted by
the FCC entitled Accelerating Wireless and Wireline Deployment by Streamlining
Local Approval of Wireless Infrastructure Modifications, 85 FR 78005-01
(published in the Federal Register on December 3, 2020); Cal. Gov’t Code §§
65850.6 and 65850.75, and all applicable federal regulations, FCC rulings and
orders, and state laws, regulations and orders applicable to the installation,
modification and/or collocation of wireless telecommunications facilities.
   (B)   Complete application required. The applicant shall submit a WTFP
application in writing to the Community Development Department on a city-
approved form as prescribed by the Director, and shall submit all information,
materials and documentation required by this section and as otherwise
determined to be necessary by the Director to effectuate the purpose and intent
of this chapter. The Director may waive certain submittal requirements or
require additional information based on specific project factors. Unless an
exemption or waiver applies, all applications shall include all of the forms,
information, materials and documentation required by the city. An application
shall not be deemed complete by the city unless the completed city application
form and all required information, materials and documentation have been
submitted to the city. An application which does not include all required
forms, information, materials and documentation required by this section shall
be deemed incomplete, and a notice of incomplete application shall be provided
to the applicant in accordance with §
12.52.050(G).
   (C)   Application fees. Concurrent with submittal of the application, the
applicant shall pay an application fee and processing fee, a deposit for an
independent expert review as set forth in this section, and a deposit for
review by the City Attorney’s office, in a payment format accepted by the
Administrative Services Department and in amounts set by resolution of the City
Council. The amounts of such fees shall be competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory. Application fees shall not exceed any maximum fees set by
federal or state law except to the extent that such fees are (a) a reasonable
approximation of costs, (b) those costs themselves are reasonable, and (c) are
nondiscriminatory. Failure to pay the fees in full at the time of application
submittal shall result in the city deeming the application incomplete. Batch
applications for small wireless facilities must include the applicable fees and
deposits for each SWF in the batch as established by resolution of the City
Council.
   (D)   Voluntary pre-submittal conference. The city strongly encourages, but
does not require, applicants to schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference
with the Director for all proposed wireless telecommunications facilities in
the PROW, including all new or replacement SWFs, and all proposed collocations
or modifications to any existing SWF. This voluntary pre-submittal conference
is not part of the application process, and does not cause the shot clock to
begin. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review
process through informal discussion and consultation that includes but is not
limited to, the proposed classification, review procedure, location, design and
application materials, permit requirements and review process for a potential
facility, any latent issues in connection with a potential project, including
compliance with generally applicable rules for public health and safety,
potential concealment issues or concerns (if applicable, coordination with
other city departments responsible for application review, and application
completion issues.
   (E)   Independent expert. The Director is authorized to retain on behalf of
the city an independent, qualified consultant to review any application for a
WTFP to review the technical aspects of the application, including but not
limited to: the accuracy, adequacy, and completeness of submissions; compliance
with applicable radio frequency emission standards; whether any requested
exception is necessary; technical demonstration of the facility designs,
configurations, technical feasibility; coverage analysis; proposal of
alternative sites and alternative designs, compliance with standards; the
validity of conclusions reached or claims made by the applicant; and other
factors deemed appropriate by the Director to effectuate the purposes of this
section. The cost of this review shall be paid by the applicant through a
deposit pursuant to an adopted fee schedule resolution. All costs shall be
reasonable and consistent with industry standards.
   (F)   Shot clocks; timeline for review and action. The timeline for review
of and action on a WTFP application shall begin to run when the application is
submitted in writing to the Department but may be reset or tolled by mutual
agreement or upon the city’s issuance of a notice of incomplete application to
the applicant pursuant to division (G) of this section. Applications shall be

(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.060 DESIGN, AESTHETIC AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   In order to ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses, protect public
safety and natural, cultural, and scenic resources, preserve and enhance the
character of residential neighborhoods and promote attractive nonresidential
areas, in addition to all other applicable requirements of this code, all WTFs
in the PROW shall be located, developed, and operated in compliance with the
following standards set forth in this section, unless the Director approves an
exception subject to the findings required by § 12.52.100, Exceptions.
   (A)   General requirements. All facilities that are located within the PROW
shall be designed and maintained as to minimize visual clutter, and reduce
noise and other impacts on and conflicts with the surrounding community in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Traffic safety. All facilities shall be designed and located in such a
manner as to avoid adverse impacts on traffic safety, and shall comply with the
most recent edition of the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) and any other traffic control rules, regulations or ordinances of the
city.
   (C)   Space occupied. Each facility shall be designed to occupy the least
amount of space in the right-of-way that is technically feasible.
   (D)   Location.
      (1)   The preferred location for a WTF shall be on existing
infrastructure such as utility poles or street lights (without traffic
signals). The infrastructure selected shall be located at alleys, streets and/
or near property line prolongations. If the facility is not able to be placed
on existing infrastructure in accordance with this division, the applicant
shall provide a map of existing infrastructure in the service area and describe
why each such site was not technically feasible, in addition to all other
application requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   All WTFs proposed to be located in the PROW next to property on
which is located single-family or multi-family dwelling units, shall comply
with the following restrictions:
         (a)   PROW Along Side Yard Setback or Alley: If a WTF is proposed to
be located in the PROW adjacent to a side yard setback or alley on a property
on which single-family or multi-family development is located, the WTF shall
not be located within ten feet of the living area of any residential dwelling
unit.
         (b)   PROW Along Front Yard Setback: If a WTF is proposed to be
located in the PROW adjacent to the front yard setback of a property on which
single-family or multi-family development is located, the WTF shall not be
located within 25 feet of the living area of any residential dwelling unit.
         (c)   The location of generators on major wireless facilities shall be
governed by Sections
12.52.060 and 12.52.230(B)(3). Procedures and requirements for a backup power
supply on major wireless facilities that qualifies as transmission equipment as
part of an eligible facility request shall be governed by procedures and
requirements for eligible facilities unless the proposal constitutes a
substantial change.
      (3)   As used herein in division (D)(2), the term LIVING AREA means the
interior habitable area of a dwelling unit, accessory dwelling unit or guest
house but does not include a garage or any accessory structure not used for
living area.
      (4)   The distance between a proposed WTF and the residential dwelling
unit shall be measured from the property line (of the lot on which the dwelling
unit is located nearest to the proposed WTF) to nearest wall of the residential
dwelling unit.
      (5)   No WTF shall be located within the PROW or any poles,
infrastructure, or other structures of any kind in the PROW, in any of the
following locations or sites:
         (a)   On any decorative lighting or pole surrounded by or adjacent to
the Historic Commercial Downtown zone; or
         (b)   In the PROW that abuts the property line of a structure
recognized as a local, state or national historic landmark, historic district
or on the register of historic places.
      (6)   Each component part of a WTF shall be located so as not to cause
any physical or visual obstruction to pedestrian or vehicular traffic,
inconvenience to the public’s use of the PROW, or safety hazards to pedestrians
and motorists, or interference with any path of travel or other disability
access requirements imposed under federal or state law.
      (7)   A WTF shall not be located within any portion of the PROW in a
manner that interferes with access to a fire hydrant, fire station, fire
escape, water valve, underground vault, valve housing structure, or any other
public health and safety facility.
      (8)   Any WTF mounted to a communications tower, above-ground accessory
equipment, or walls, fences, landscaping or other screening methods in the PROW
shall have and maintain a minimum setback of 18 inches from the front of a
curb.
      (9)   To conceal the non-antenna equipment, applicants shall install all
non-antenna equipment (including but not limited to all cables) underground to
the extent technically feasible based on technical specifications or features
provided by the manufacturer. If such non-antenna equipment is proposed within
an underground utility district formed pursuant to
Chapter 13.16 of Title 13 of this code, and the type of non-antenna equipment
has been exempted by the City Council from undergrounding pursuant to §§
13.16.080 or
13.16.090 or any other provision of the code, the non-antenna equipment shall
comply with the requirements of this section if the Director finds that such
undergrounding is technically feasible and undergrounding is required for
building, traffic, emergency, disability access, or other safety requirements.
Additional expense to install and maintain an underground equipment enclosure
does not exempt an applicant from this requirement, except where the applicant
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that this requirement will
effectively prohibit the provision of wireless communications services.
   (E)   Concealment or stealth elements. Stealth or concealment elements may
include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Radio frequency transparent screening;
      (2)   Approved, specific colors;
      (3)   Integrating the installation into existing utility infrastructure;
      (4)   Installing new infrastructure that matches existing infrastructure
in the area surrounding the proposed site.
      (5)   Controlling the installation location pursuant to division (D) of
this section.
   (F)   Collocation. The applicant and owner of any site on which a WTF is
located shall cooperate and exercise good faith in collocating facilities on
the same support structures or site. Good faith shall include sharing technical
information to evaluate the feasibility of collocation, and may include
negotiations for erection of a replacement support structure to accommodate
collocation. A competitive conflict to collocation or financial burden caused
by sharing information normally will not be considered as an excuse to the duty
of good faith.
      (1)   All WTFs shall make available unused space for collocation of other
facilities, including space for these entities providing similar, competing
services. Collocation is not required if the host facility can demonstrate that
the addition of the new service or facilities would impair existing service or
cause the host to go offline for a significant period of time. In the event a
dispute arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith in
accommodating other users, the Director may require the applicant to obtain a
third-party technical study at applicant’s expense. The Director may review any
information submitted by applicant and permittee(s) in determining whether good
faith has been exercised.
      (2)   All collocated and multiple-user facilities shall be designed to
promote facility and site sharing. Communication towers and necessary
appurtenances, including but not limited to parking areas, access roads,
utilities and equipment buildings, shall be shared by site users whenever
possible.
      (3)   No collocation may be required where it can be shown that the
shared use would or does result in significant interference in the broadcast or
reception capabilities of the existing WTFs or failure of the existing
facilities to meet federal standards for emissions.
      (4)   Failure to comply with collocation requirements when feasible or
cooperate in good faith as provided for in this section is grounds for denial
of a permit request or revocation of an existing permit.
   (G)   Radio frequency standards; noise.
      (1)   WTFs shall comply with federal standards for radio frequency (RF)
emissions and interference. No facility or combination of facilities shall at
any time produce power densities that exceed the FCC’s limits for electric and
magnetic field strength and power density for transmitters or operate in a
manner that will degrade or interfere with existing communications systems as
stipulated by federal law. Failure to meet federal standards may result in
termination or modification of the permit.
      (2)   WTFs and any related equipment, including backup generators and air
conditioning units, shall not generate continuous noise in excess of 40
decibels (dBa) measured at the property line of any adjacent residential
property, and shall not generate continuous noise in excess of 50 dBa during
the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and 40 dBa during the hours of 10:00 p.m.
to 7:00 a.m. measured at the property line of any nonresidential adjacent
property. Backup generators shall only be operated during emergencies, power
outages and for testing and maintenance purposes. Testing and maintenance shall
only take place on weekdays between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
   (H)   Additional standards. Consistent with federal and state laws and
regulations, the City Council may further establish design and development
standards pursuant to rules and guidelines, including but not limited to,
relating to antennas, new, existing and replacement poles, wind loads,
obstructions, supporting structures, screening, accessory equipment,
landscaping, signage, lighting, security and fire prevention.
   (I)   Modification. To the extent authorized by state and federal laws and
regulations, at the time of modification of a WTF, existing equipment shall, to
the extent feasible, be replaced with equipment that reduces visual, noise and
other impacts, including, but not limited to undergrounding the equipment and
replacing larger, more visually intrusive facilities with smaller, less
visually intrusive facilities. If the proposed modification is submitted as
part of an eligible facility request, then the provisions governing eligible
facilities apply, unless the proposal constitutes a substantial change.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.070 STANDARD CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
   All WTFP approvals for facilities located or proposed to be located in the
PROW, whether approved by the approval authority or deemed approved by the
operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the conditions in this
section, in addition to any conditions imposed by the approval authority
pursuant to this chapter and the rules and guidelines. The approval authority
shall have discretion to modify or amend these conditions on a case-by-case
basis as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances to protect
public health and safety or allow for the proper operation of the approved
facility consistent with the goals of this chapter.
   (A)   Permit term. A WTFP shall be valid for a period of ten years, unless
it is revoked sooner in accordance with this chapter or pursuant to any other
provision of federal or state law that authorizes the city to issue a WTFP with
a shorter term, or such WTFP is extended pursuant to § 12.52.170. At the end of
the term, the WTFP shall automatically expire. Except as otherwise provided in
division (A)(1)(a), any other permits or approvals issued in connection with
any collocation, modification or other change to the facility, which includes
without limitation any permits or other approvals deemed-granted or deemed-
approved under federal or state law, will not extend the ten-year term limit
unless expressly provided otherwise in such permit or approval or required
under federal or state law.
      (1)   Eligible facility permits. In addition to the provisions of
division (A), the following provisions apply.
         (a)   The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of an EFP will not
extend the term, if any, for any ministerial permit or other underlying prior
regulatory permit, approval or other authorization. Accordingly, the term for
an EFP approval shall be coterminous with the ministerial permit and other
underlying permit, approval or other prior regulatory authorization for the
subject tower or base station. This condition shall not be applied or
interpreted in any way that would cause the term of the underlying permit for
the modified facility to be less than ten years in total length, unless such
underlying permit is abandoned or revoked pursuant to this code or any other
provision of federal or state law.
         (b)   Accelerated approval terms due to invalidation. In the event
that any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of Section
6409(a) or any FCC rule that interprets Section 6409(a) such that federal law
would not mandate approval for any eligible facilities request pursuant to
Section 6409(a), such EFP approval shall automatically expire one year from the
effective date of the judicial order, unless the decision would not authorize
accelerated termination of any previously approved EFP or the Director grants
an extension upon written request from the permittee that shows good cause for
the extension, which includes, without limitation, extreme financial hardship.
Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the contrary, the Director
may not grant a permanent exemption or indefinite extension. A permittee shall
not be required to remove any equipment, components, structures and
improvements approved under the invalidated EFP approval when it has submitted
an application for a SWFP under § 12.52.050 for those WTFs before the one-year
period ends. If the SWFP is denied, the permittee shall remove all its
equipment, components, structures and improvements before the one-year period
ends.
         (c)   No waiver of standing. The approval of an EFP (either by express
approval or by operation of law) does not waive, and shall not be construed to
waive, any standing by the city to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules
that interpret Section 6409(a) and/or any eligible facilities approval pursuant
to Section 6409(a) (whether by the approval authority or by operation of law).
   (B)   Strict compliance with approved plans. Any application filed by the
permittee for a ministerial permit to construct or install the WTF, generator
and other equipment and structures that are located in the PROW approved by a
WTFP must incorporate the WTFP approval, all conditions associated with the
WTFP approval and the approved photo simulations into the project plans (the
“approved plans”). The permittee must construct, install, operate and maintain
the facility and related equipment and structures in strict compliance with the
approved plans. Any alterations, modifications or other changes to the approved
plans, whether requested by the permittee or required by other departments or
public agencies with jurisdiction over the WTF, must be submitted in a written
request subject to the Director’s prior review and approval. With respect to
EFPs, the Director may revoke the EFP approval if the Director finds that the
requested alteration, modification or other change may cause a substantial
change as that term is defined by Section 6409(a) or the FCC in 47 C.F.R. §
1.6100(b)(7), or any successor regulation (see §§
12.52.020 (Definitions) and
12.52.050(E) of this chapter).
   (C)   Build-out period. The WTF approval will automatically expire one year
from the MTWP approval or deemed-granted date unless the permittee obtains all
other permits and approvals required to install, construct and/or operate the
approved facility under this code, and any other permits or approvals required
by any federal, state or other local public agencies with jurisdiction over the
subject property, the eligible facility or its use. The Director may grant one
written extension to a date certain when the permittee shows good cause to
extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension submitted
at least 30 days prior to the automatic expiration date in this condition.
   (D)   Maintenance obligations. The permittee shall keep the site, which
includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures,
access routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe
condition in substantial compliance with the approved plans and all conditions
in the WTFP. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter and
debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the city, shall remove and
remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within 48 hours after the
permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or
other vandalism occurred.
   (E)   Property maintenance. The permittee shall ensure that all equipment
and other improvements to be constructed and/or installed in connection with
the approved plans are maintained in a manner that is not detrimental or
injurious to the public health, safety, and general welfare and that the
aesthetic appearance is continuously preserved, and substantially the same as
shown in the approved plans at all times relevant to the WTFP. The permittee
further acknowledges that failure to maintain compliance with this condition
may result in a code enforcement action.
   (F)   Compliance with laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all
times with all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other
rules that carry the force of law (“governing laws”) applicable to the
permittee, the subject property, the WTF and any use or activities in
connection with the use authorized in the WTFP, which includes without
limitation any laws applicable to human exposure to RF emissions. The permittee
expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be
broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in these conditions
are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen the permittee’s obligations
to maintain compliance with all governing laws. In the event that the city
fails to timely notice, prompt or enforce compliance with any applicable
provision in the municipal code, any permit, any permit condition or any
governing laws, the applicant or permittee will not be relieved from its
obligation to comply in all respects with all applicable provisions in the
code, any permit, any permit condition or any governing laws.
   (G)   Adverse impacts on other properties. The permittee shall use all
reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on
nearby properties that may arise from the permittee’s or its authorized
personnel’s construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance,
repair, removal and/or other activities at the site. Impacts of radio frequency
emissions on the environment, to the extent that such emissions are compliant
with all governing laws, are not “adverse impacts” for the purposes of this
condition. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to perform any
construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair,
removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines except during
normal construction hours authorized by the code. The restricted work hours in
this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an actual,
immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency declared
by the city. The Director or the Director’s designee may issue a stop work
order for any activities that violate this condition.
   (H)   Inspections — Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the city’s officers, officials, staff or other designee may enter
onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment upon reasonable prior
notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the city’s officers,
officials, staff or other designee may, but will not be obligated to, enter
onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair, disable or remove
any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements or
equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee
will be permitted to supervise the city’s officers, officials, staff or other
designee while any such inspection or emergency access occurs to the extent not
inconsistent with city requirements.
   (I)   Permittee’s contact information. The permittee shall furnish the
Director with accurate and up-to-date contact information for a person
responsible for the facility, which includes without limitation such person’s
full name, title, direct telephone number, facsimile number, mailing address
and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date
at all times and immediately provide the Director with updated contact
information in the event that either the responsible person or such person’s
contact information changes.
   (J)   Insurance. The permittee shall obtain, pay for and maintain, in full
force and effect until the WTF approved by the permit is removed in its
entirety from the PROW, an insurance policy or policies of public liability
insurance which shall be in the form and substance satisfactory to the city,
and shall be maintained until the term of the permit ended and the facility is
removed from the PROW. The insurance shall comply with the minimum limits and
coverages and provisions set forth in the rules and guidelines, and as
otherwise established from time to time by the city, and which fully protect
the city from claims and suits for bodily injury, death, and property damage.
   (K)   Indemnification.
      (1)   The permittee, and if applicable, the owner of the WTF upon which
the facility is installed in the PROW, shall agree in writing to defend,
indemnify, protect and hold harmless city, its elected and appointed officials,
officers, boards, commissions, agents, consultants, employees, volunteers and
independent contractors serving as city officials (collectively “indemnitees”),
from and against any and all claims, actions, or proceeding against the
indemnitees or any of them, to attack, set aside, void or annul, an approval of
the Director or Development Review Committee concerning the permit and the
construction, operation, maintenance and/or repair of the facility. Such
indemnification shall include damages, judgments, settlements, penalties,
fines, defensive costs or expenses, including, but not limited to, interest,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees, or liability of any kind
related to or arising from such claim, action, or proceeding. The permittee
shall also agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from the city in
connection with the grant of the permit and also agree to abide by the city’s
ordinances and other laws. The city shall promptly notify the permittee of any
claim, action, or proceeding. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit city from
participating in a defense of any claim, action or proceeding. The city shall
have the option of coordinating the defense, including, but not limited to,
choosing counsel for the defense at the permittee’s expense.
      (2)   Additionally, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
permittee, and every permittee and if applicable, the owner of the WTF upon
which the facility is installed in the PROW, shall jointly and severally, shall
defend, indemnify, protect and hold the city and its elected and appointed
officials, officers, boards, commissions, agents, consultants, employees and
volunteers harmless from and against all claims, suits, demands, actions,
losses, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs (including, but not limited
to, attorney’s fees, interest and expert witness fees), or damages claimed by
third parties against the city for any injury claim, and for property damage
sustained by any person, arising out of, resulting from, or are in any way
related to the WTF, or to any work done by or use of the PROW by the permittee,
owner or operator of the facility, or their agents, excepting only liability
arising out of the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the city and its
elected and appointed officials, officers, boards, commissions, agents,
consultants, employees and volunteers and independent contractors serving as
city officials.
   (L)   Performance security. Prior to issuance of any WTFP, the permittee
shall pay for and provide a performance bond or other form of security that
complies with the following minimum requirements.
      (1)   The security shall expressly survive the duration of the permit
term and shall remain in effect until the facility is fully and completely
removed and the site reasonably returned to its original condition, to cover
the removal costs of the facility in the event that use of the facility is
abandoned or the approval is otherwise terminated.
      (2)   The security shall be in a format and amount approved by the
Director and City Attorney’s office. The amount of security shall be as
determined by the Director to be necessary to ensure proper completion of the
applicant’s removal obligations. In establishing the amount of the security,
and in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code § 65964(a), the Director shall take into
consideration information provided by the applicant regarding the cost of
removal of the facility and all related structures and equipment. The amount of
the security instrument shall be calculated by the applicant as part of its
application in an amount rationally related to the obligations covered by the
security instrument. The permittee shall be required to submit the approved
security instrument to the Director prior to issuance of any WTFP for the
proposed facility.
      (3)   Security shall always be imposed if the WTF is located in a PROW
adjacent to any residentially zoned property or residential uses.
   (M)   Acceptance of conditions. The WTFP shall not become effective for any
purpose unless/until a city “Acceptance of Conditions” form, in a form approved
by the City Attorney’s office, has been signed and notarized by the applicant/
permittee before being returned to the Director within ten days after the
determination letter has been served on the applicant and published on the
city’s website in accordance with §
12.52.060(A). The permit shall be void and of no force or effect unless such
written agreement is received by the city within said ten-day period.

of incomplete application pursuant to §
12.52.050(G)(2)), the applicant may provide the city written notice that the
time period for acting has lapsed.
         (b)   An EFP deemed approved pursuant to Section 6409(a) shall comply
with all applicable Construction Codes, traffic, or other health and safety
requirements of the code deemed applicable by the Director, including, without
limitation, obtaining an encroachment permit from the city and any
authorization or permit needed by the owner of the facility or pole.
      (5)   Effect of changes to federal law. This division does not and shall
not be construed to grant any rights beyond those granted by Section 6409(a)
and its implementing federal regulations. In the event Section 6409(a) or
applicable regulations are stayed, amended, revised or otherwise not in effect,
no modifications to an eligible facility shall be processed or approved under

(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.100 EXCEPTIONS, DIRECTOR FINDINGS.
   (A)   General requirements. An exception from the strict locational,
physical, or design, or development requirements of §
12.52.070, may be granted by the Director in his/her discretion, when it is
shown to the Director’s satisfaction, based on substantial evidence, any of the
following:
      (1)   Because of special, unique circumstances applicable to the proposed
location and/or the proposed WTF, the strict application of the requirements of
the section would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by other
permittees in the vicinity operating a similar facility; or
      (2)   Denial of the facility as proposed would violate federal law, state
law, or both; or
      (3)   A provision of this section, as applied to applicant, would deprive
applicant of its rights under federal law, state law, or both.
   (B)   Application requirements. An applicant may only request an exception
at the time of applying for a WTFP. The request must include both the specific
provision(s) of this section from which the exception is sought and the basis
of the request. Any request for an exception after the city has deemed an
application complete shall be treated as a new application.
   (C)   Burden. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing the basis
for any requested exception.
   (D)   Scope; conditions. The Director shall limit its exception to the
extent to which the applicant demonstrates such an exception is necessary to
reasonably achieve its reasonable technical service objectives. In addition to
the standard conditions of approval pursuant to §
12.52.070, the Director may adopt other conditions of approval as will assure
that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special
privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other wireless providers
seeking to locate any facility in the area where such property is situated and
that are reasonably necessary to promote the purposes in this section and
protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   (E)   Prohibited locations; no exception. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this section, SWFs are prohibited in and no exception shall be
granted by the Director, on any location or site within a PROW for which
approval cannot be obtained by any federal or state agency with jurisdiction
over the proposed facility.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.110 NONEXCLUSIVE GRANT.
   No permit or approval granted under this chapter shall confer any exclusive
right, privilege, license or franchise to occupy or use the PROW of the city
for any purpose whatsoever. Further, no approval shall be construed as any
warranty of title.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.120 BUSINESS LICENSE.
   A permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall not substitute for any

(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.130 TEMPORARY SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES.
   (A)   Emergency deployment. In the event of a declared federal, state, or
local emergency, or when otherwise warranted by conditions that the Director
deems to constitute an emergency, the Director may approve the installation and
operation of a temporary small wireless facility, subject to such reasonable
conditions that the Director deems necessary.
   (B)   Exclusions; removal. A temporary small wireless facility shall not be
permitted for maintenance activities or while awaiting an expected entitlement
or pending plan review, and the allowance of a temporary small wireless
facility during an emergency shall not be considered to establish a permanent
use of such a facility after the emergency has ended, as declared by the City
Manager or other appropriate federal, state, or local official. Any temporary
small wireless facilities placed pursuant to this section must be removed
within five days after the date the emergency is lifted. Any person or entity
that places temporary small wireless facilities pursuant to this division must
send a written notice that identifies the site location and person responsible
for its operation to the Director as soon as reasonably practicable.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)

days of beginning operations under a new or amended permit a technically
sufficient report (“monitoring report”) that demonstrates all of the following:
   (A)   The facility is in compliance with all applicable federal regulations,
including but not limited to, the FCC’s RF emissions standards as certified by
a qualified radio frequency emissions engineer; and
   (B)   The facility is in compliance with all provisions of this section and
the city’s conditions of approval.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.160 NO DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OR OBSTRUCTIONS ALLOWED.
   No person shall install, use or maintain any WTF which in whole or in part
rests upon, in or over any PROW, when such installation, use or maintenance
endangers or is reasonably likely to endanger the safety of persons or
property, or when such site or location is used for public utility purposes,
public transportation purposes or other governmental use, or when such WTF
unreasonably interferes with or unreasonably impedes the flow of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic including any legally parked or stopped vehicle, the ingress
into or egress from any residence or place of business, the use of poles,
posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, permitted sidewalk
dining, permitted street furniture or other objects permitted at or near said
location.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.170 PERMIT EXTENSION.
   (A)   Time of application. A permittee may apply for extensions of its WTFP
in increments of no more than ten years and no sooner than 180 days (six
months) prior to expiration of the permit. Any request for an extension that is
filed less than 180 days (six months) prior to expiration shall require a new
permit in accordance with the application and procedural requirements of the
then-current requirements of this code.
   (B)   Application requirements. In addition to all other requirements of
this section, the permittee’s application for extension shall include proof
that the permittee continues to have the legal authority to occupy and use the
PROW for the purpose set forth in its WTFP, that the facility site as it exists
at the time of the extension application is in full compliance with all
applicable city permits issued for the site, and shall be accompanied by an
affidavit and supporting documentation that the facility is in compliance with
all applicable FCC and other governmental regulations. At the Director’s
discretion, additional studies and information may be required of the
applicant. Grounds for non-renewal of the WTFP shall include, but are not
limited to, the permittee’s failure to submit the affidavit or proof of legal
authority to occupy or use the PROW. The burden is on the permittee to
demonstrate that the facility complies with all requirements for an extension.
   (C)   Director decision. If a WTFP has not expired at the time a timely
application is made for an extension, the Director may administratively extend
the term of the WTFP for subsequent ten-year terms upon verification of
continued compliance with the findings and conditions of approval under which
the application was originally approved, all provisions set forth in division
(B), above, and any other applicable provisions of this code that are in effect
at the time the permit extension is granted. The Director’s decision shall be
issued in the form of a written determination letter in accordance with §
12.52.060(A). The Director’s decision on an application for the extension of a
WTFP shall be final and conclusive and not be appealable to the City Council.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.180 CESSATION OF USE OR ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   A WTF is considered abandoned and shall be promptly removed as
provided herein if it ceases to provide wireless communications services for 90
or more consecutive days. If there are two or more users of a single facility,
then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the
facility.
   (B)   The operator of a facility shall notify the city in writing of its
intent to abandon or cease use of a permitted site or a nonconforming site
(including an unpermitted site) within ten days of ceasing or abandoning use.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the operator of the facility shall
provide written notice to the Director of any discontinuation of operations of
30 days or more.
   (C)   Failure to inform the Director of cessation or discontinuation of
operations of any existing facility as required by this division shall
constitute a violation of any approvals and be grounds for enforcement pursuant
to §
12.52.190.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)
§ 12.52.190 REVOCATION OR MODIFICATION, REMOVAL; APPEAL.
   (A)   Revocation or modification of WTFP by Community Development Director.
The Director may modify or revoke any WTFP and any other related permits
required by the code if the operation or maintenance of the facility violates
any of the permit’s terms or conditions, this chapter, the code, or any other
local, state or federal laws in accordance with the following procedures.
      (1)   When the Director has reason to believe that grounds exist for the
modification or revocation of a WTFP, he or she shall give written notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid thereof to the permittee setting forth a
statement of the facts and grounds. The permittee shall have not less than ten
days from date of deposit of the Director’s notice in the mail to submit a
written response and supporting documentation to the Director prior to the
Director’s decision. The Director’s decision shall be issued in writing in
accordance with the procedures set out in §
12.52.060(A).
      (2)   The Director may revoke or modify the WTFP and any related permits
if he or she makes any of the following findings:
         (a)   The WTFP or other permit(s) has expired as provided for in §
12.52.080: Permit Expiration.
         (b)   The facility has been abandoned as provided in §
12.52.180: Cessation of Use or Abandonment.
         (c)   The permittee has failed to comply with one or more of the
conditions of approval, this chapter or any other provision of this code.
         (d)   The facility has been substantially changed in character or
substantially expanded beyond the approval set forth in the permit.
      (3)   If the Director determines that modification of the WTFP or other
permit(s) is warranted, he or she may impose any revised or new conditions that
he or she deems appropriate based on his/her other findings.
   (B)   Appeal. Decisions of the Director to modify or revoke a WTFP or other
related permits shall be subject to the administrative review by the
Development Review Committee in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   The effectiveness of any decision of the Community Development
Director to suspend or revoke a WTFP shall be stayed during: (a) the appeal
period set forth in division (B)(2) of this section; and (b) the pendency of
any appeal.
      (2)   Any person whose WTFP is suspended or revoked by the Director may
appeal to the Development Review Committee by filing a written appeal with the
City Clerk within 14 days after the decision of the Director; provided,
however, that if the 14 days expires on a date that City Hall is not open for
business, then the appeal period shall be extended to the next city business
day. Such appeal shall indicate the ground(s) upon which the appeal is based.
      (3)   Failure to file a timely written appeal deprives the Development
Review Committee of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
   (C)   Development Review Committee review.
      (1)   Upon the filing of a timely appeal, the Development Review
Committee shall hold a hearing on the suspension or revocation of the WFTP.
Notice of the time, date and place of the hearing shall be mailed to the
permittee, or shall be personally delivered, at least ten days prior to the
date of the hearing.
      (2)   The following procedures shall govern the hearing conducted by the
Development Review Committee. All parties involved shall have a right to: (a)
offer testimonial, documentary and tangible evidence bearing on the issues; (b)
be represented by counsel; and (c) confront and cross-examine witnesses. Any
relevant evidence may be admitted that is the sort of evidence upon which
reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.
Any hearing may be continued for a reasonable time for the convenience of a
party or a witness.
      (3)   At the conclusion of the hearing, or at any time within 30 days
thereafter, the Development Review Committee shall render a decision. The
Development Review Committee may affirm, modify or reverse the action of the
Director. The decision of the Development Review Committee shall be made in
writing, shall be supported by findings, and shall be final.
      (4)   No later than three city business days after the Development Review
Committee’s decision, notice of the decision and a copy thereof shall be mailed
by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the appellant. Such notice shall
contain the substance of the following statement: “You are hereby notified that
the time within which judicial review of this decision may be sought is
governed by California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.6.”
   (C)   Judicial review. Judicial review of the decision of the Development
Review Committee may be sought in accordance with Cal. Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 1094.5 et seq. or as otherwise permitted by law.
   (D)   Permittee’s removal obligation. Upon the expiration date of the WTFP,
including any extensions, earlier termination or revocation of the WTFP or
abandonment of the facility, or final decision on appeal, whichever occurs
latest, the WTFP shall become null and void, and the permittee, owner or
operator shall completely remove its facility. Removal shall be in accordance
with proper health and safety requirements and all ordinances, rules, and
regulations of the city. The facility shall be removed from the PROW within 30
days, unless a longer period is approved by the city, at no cost or expense to
the city. If the facility is located on a WTF owned by a public utility or
private entity, the public utility or private property owner shall also be
independently responsible for the expense of timely removal and restoration.
   (E)   Failure to remove. Failure of the permittee, owner, or operator to
promptly remove its facility and restore the PROW and any city-property thereon
to its original condition within 30 days (or such longer period approved by the
city) after expiration, earlier termination, or revocation of the WTFP, or
abandonment of the facility, shall be a violation of this code, and be grounds
for:
      (1)   Prosecution;
      (2)   Calling of any bond or other assurance required by this section or
conditions of approval of permit;
      (3)   Removal of the facility by the city in accordance with the
procedures established under this code for abatement of a public nuisance at
the owner’s expense; and/or
      (4)   Any other remedies permitted under this code.
   (F)   Summary removal. In the event the Director determines that the
condition or placement of a WTF located in the PROW constitutes a dangerous
condition, obstruction of the PROW, or an imminent threat to public safety, or
determines other exigent circumstances require immediate corrective action
(collectively, “exigent circumstances”), the Director may cause the facility to
be removed summarily and immediately without advance notice or a hearing.
Written notice of the removal shall be served upon the person who owns the
facility within five business days of removal and all property removed shall be
preserved for the owner’s pick-up as feasible. If the owner cannot be
identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails to pick-up the
property within 60 days, the facility shall be treated as abandoned property.
   (G)   Removal of facilities by city. In the event the city removes a WTF in
accordance with nuisance abatement procedures or summary removal, any such
removal shall be without any liability to the city for any damage to such
facility that may result from reasonable efforts of removal. In addition to the
procedures for recovering costs of nuisance abatement, the city may collect
such costs from the performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed
the amount of the performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance
with this code. Unless otherwise provided herein, the city has no obligation to
store such facility. Neither the permittee nor the owner nor operator shall
have any claim if the city destroys any such facility not timely removed by the
permittee, owner, or operator after notice, or removed by the city due to
exigent circumstances.
   (H)   Non-exclusive remedies. Each and every remedy available for the
enforcement of this section shall be non-exclusive and it is within the
discretion of the authorized inspector or enforcing attorney to seek cumulative
remedies set forth in this code, except that multiple monetary fines or

government with the authority to regulate wireless telecommunications providers
and/or WTFs. If such standards and/or regulations are changed, the permittee
and/or wireless communications provider shall bring its facility into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 90 days of the
effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal or state agency.
Failure to bring facilities into compliance with any revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the immediate removal of such
facilities at the permittee and/or wireless telecommunications provider’s
expense.
(Ord. 2021-09 § 5 (part), 2021)

    Section 1613.6 is added to Chapter 16 of the 2022 Edition of the California
Building Code to read as follows:
   1613.6 Seismic design provisions for hillside buildings.
      1613.6.1 Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum
regulations for the design and construction of new buildings and additions to
existing buildings when constructing such buildings on or into slopes steeper
than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33.3%). These regulations
establish minimum standards for seismic force resistance to reduce the risk of
injury or loss of life in the event of earthquakes.
      1613.6.2 Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply to the design
of the lateral-force-resisting system for hillside buildings at and below the
base level diaphragm. The design of the lateral-force-resisting system above
the base level diaphragm shall be in accordance with the provisions for seismic
and wind design as required elsewhere in this division.
         Exception: Non-habitable accessory buildings and decks not supporting
or supported from the main building are exempt from these regulations.
      1613.6.3 Definitions. For the purposes of this section certain terms are
defined as follows:
         BASE LEVEL DIAPHRAGM is the floor at, or closest to, the top of the
highest level of the foundation.
         DIAPHRAGM ANCHORS are assemblies that connect a diaphragm to the
adjacent foundation at the uphill diaphragm edge.
         DOWNHILL DIRECTION is the descending direction of the slope
approximately perpendicular to the slope contours.
         FOUNDATION is concrete or masonry which supports a building, including
footings, stem walls, retaining walls, and grade beams.
          FOUNDATION EXTENDING IN THE DOWNHILL DIRECTION is a foundation
running downhill and approximately perpendicular to the uphill foundation.
         HILLSIDE BUILDING is any building or portion thereof constructed on or
into a slope steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33.3%).
If only a portion of the building is supported on or into the slope, these
regulations apply to the entire building.
         PRIMARY ANCHORS are diaphragm anchors designed for and providing a
direct connection as described in Sections 1613.6.5 and 1613.6.7.3 between the
diaphragm and the uphill foundation.
         SECONDARY ANCHORS are diaphragm anchors designed for and providing a
redundant diaphragm to foundation connection, as described in Sections 1613.6.6
and 1613.6.7.4.
         UPHILL DIAPHRAGM EDGE is the edge of the diaphragm adjacent and
closest to the highest ground level at the perimeter of the diaphragm.
         UPHILL FOUNDATION is the foundation parallel and closest to the uphill
diaphragm edge.
      1613.6.4 Analysis and design.
         1613.6.4.1 General. Every hillside building within the scope of this
section shall be analyzed, designed, and constructed in accordance with the
provisions of this division. When the code-prescribed wind design produces
greater effects, the wind design shall govern, but detailing requirements and
limitations prescribed in this and referenced sections shall be followed.
         1613.6.4.2 Base level diaphragm-downhill direction. The following
provisions shall apply to the seismic analysis and design of the connections
for the base level diaphragm in the downhill direction.
         1613.6.4.2.1 Base for lateral force design defined. For seismic forces
acting in the downhill direction, the base of the building shall be the floor
at or closest to the top of the highest level of the foundation.
         1613.6.4.2.2 Base shear. In developing the base shear for seismic
design, the response modification coefficient (R) shall not exceed 5 for
bearing wall and building frame systems. The total base shear shall include the
forces tributary to the base level diaphragm including forces from the base
level diaphragm.
      1613.6.5 Base shear resistance-primary anchors.
          1613.6.5.1 General. The base shear in the downhill direction shall be
resisted through primary anchors from diaphragm struts provided in the base
level diaphragm to the foundation.
         1613.6.5.2 Location of primary anchors. A primary anchor and diaphragm
strut shall be provided in line with each foundation extending in the downhill
direction. Primary anchors and diaphragm struts shall also be provided where
interior vertical lateral-force-resisting elements occur above and in contact
with the base level diaphragm. The spacing of primary anchors and diaphragm
struts or collectors shall in no case exceed 30 feet (9144 mm).
         1613.6.5.3 Design of primary anchors and diaphragm struts. Primary
anchors and diaphragm struts shall be designed in accordance with the
requirements of Section 1613.6.8.
         1613.6.5.4 Limitations. The following lateral-force-resisting elements
shall not be designed to resist seismic forces below the base level diaphragm
in the downhill direction:
            1.   Wood structural panel wall sheathing,
            2.   Cement plaster and lath,
            3.   Gypsum wallboard, and
            4.   Tension only braced frames.
            Braced frames designed in accordance with the requirements of
Section 2205.2.1.2 may be used to transfer forces from the primary anchors and
diaphragm struts to the foundation provided lateral forces do not induce
flexural stresses in any member of the frame or in the diaphragm struts.
Deflections of frames shall account for the variation in slope of diagonal
members when the frame is not rectangular.
      1613.6.6 Base shear resistance-secondary anchors.
         1613.6.6.1 General. In addition to the primary anchors required by
Section 1613.6.5, the base shear in the downhill direction shall be resisted
through secondary anchors in the uphill foundation connected to diaphragm
struts in the base level diaphragm.
            Exception: Secondary anchors are not required where foundations
extending in the downhill direction spaced at not more than 30 feet (9144 mm)
on center extend up to and are directly connected to the base level diaphragm
for at least 70% of the diaphragm depth.

the base level diaphragm shall be designed for a minimum force equal to the
base shear, including forces tributary to the base level diaphragm, but not
less than 600 pounds per lineal foot (8.76 kN/m) based on Allowable Stress
Design (ASD) levels. The secondary anchors shall be uniformly distributed along
the uphill diaphragm edge and shall be spaced a maximum of 4 feet (1219 mm) on
center.
          1613.6.6.3 Design. Secondary anchors and diaphragm struts shall be
designed in accordance with Section 1613.6.8.

diaphragm shall be designed as a diaphragm.
         1613.6.7.2 Design force. Each diaphragm below the base level diaphragm
shall be designed for all tributary loads at that level using a minimum seismic
force factor not less than the base shear coefficient.
         1613.6.7.3 Design force resistance-primary anchors. The design force
described in Section 1613.6.7.2 shall be resisted through primary anchors from
diaphragm struts provided in each diaphragm to the foundation. Primary anchors
shall be provided and designed in accordance with the requirements and
limitations of Section 1613.6.5.
         1613.6.7.4 Design force resistance-secondary anchors.
            1613.6.7.4.1 General. In addition to the primary anchors required

diaphragm struts in each diaphragm below the base level.
               Exception: Secondary anchors are not required where foundations
extending in the downhill direction, spaced at not more than 30 feet (9144 mm)
on center, extend up to and are directly connected to each diaphragm below the
base level for at least 70% of the diaphragm depth.
            1613.6.7.4.2 Secondary anchor capacity. Secondary anchors at each
diaphragm below the base level diaphragm shall be designed for a minimum force
equal to the design force but not less than 300 pounds per lineal foot (4.38
kN/m) based on Allowable Stress Design (ASD) levels. The secondary anchors
shall be uniformly distributed along the uphill diaphragm edge and shall be
spaced a maximum of 4 feet (1219 mm) on center.
            1613.6.7.4.3 Design. Secondary anchors and diaphragm struts shall
be designed in accordance with Section 1613.6.8.

§ 15.28.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards to safeguard
life, health, property and the public welfare by regulating and controlling the
quality of materials used in, and the design, construction, location and
maintenance of grading, and to implement measures to substantially reduce the
potential for erosion and sedimentation damage within the city.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.010) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.020 SCOPE, INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all grading within the
city, unless specifically exempted under this section.
   (B)   If two or more pertinent limitations are not identical, those
limitations shall prevail which provide the greater measure of safety to life,
health, property or the public welfare and which are more restrictive upon the
operations of the applicant, or which place upon the applicant the greater duty
of providing safeguards both to the property being graded and to other property
in the area. The permissive provisions of this chapter shall not be presumed to
waive any limitations imposed by other ordinances of the city, state statutes
or the requirements of other regulatory agencies.
   (C)   Neither the issuance of a permit under the provisions of this chapter,
nor the compliance with the provisions of this chapter or with any conditions
imposed in the permit issued under this chapter, shall relieve any person from
responsibility for damage to other persons or property, nor impose any
liability upon the city for damage to other persons or property.
   (D)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any of the
following:
      (1)   Work in a public street, alley or sidewalk or other public place
regulated by
Chapter 12.08;
      (2)   Mining, quarrying, processing or stockpiling of rock, sand,
aggregate or clay, unless such work affects the lateral support of adjacent or
contiguous property or structures;
      (3)   Depositing of rubbish or other material at any dump operated by the
city or operated under a valid permit issued by the city;
      (4)   Excavation or filling of graves in property dedicated or used for
cemetery purposes.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.020) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.030 DEFINITIONS.
   Whenever the following words are used in this chapter they shall have the
meanings indicated in this section:

(`83 Code, § 15.28.030) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985; Ord. 2003-07, 2003)
§ 15.28.040 GENERAL REQUIREMENT—MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES.
   The owner, land occupier, or other person in control of any property who
orders, or causes land owned, occupied or controlled by him, or any land, to be
graded, or knowingly permits the same, shall maintain in good condition and
repair all retaining walls, cribbing, drainage structures, slope planting,
sprinkler systems, berms, terracing and other protective devices, together with
all fills, excavations and operations and conditions resulting therefrom.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.040) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.050 PERMIT—REQUIRED.
   No person shall commence or perform any grading without having first
obtained a grading permit from the Engineer. A separate grading permit shall be
obtained for each site. One permit may cover both an excavation and any fill
made with the excavated materials on the same site. For any grading that is to
be performed, or for any unprotected graded surface that is to remain, during
the period of October 15 to April 15, a separate erosion control permit is
required.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.050) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.060 PERMIT—EXCEPTIONS.
   A grading permit shall not be required for the following exceptions, but in
all other respects the provisions of this chapter shall apply:
   (A)   An excavation below finished grade for basements and footings of a
building, swimming pool or underground structure authorized by a valid building
permit;

specifically exempted by the Engineer.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.060) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.070 PERMIT—APPLICATION.
   (A)   An applicant for a grading permit shall first file an application
there for in writing with the Engineering Department. Every such application
shall:
      (1)   Give the name and address of the record owner(s) of the site;
      (2)   Give the name and address of the grading contractor;
      (3)   Give the legal description and street address of the site;
      (4)   State the purpose of the work;
      (5)   Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for
which application is made;
      (6)   Be accompanied by a construction schedule which will show the
estimated start and finish dates for every major element of work, including any
required public improvements. The builder shall submit a revised schedule
monthly, or as often as deemed necessary by the Engineer. Note: If the schedule
indicates that any portion of the work is to be performed between October 15
and April 15 a separate erosion and sedimentation control permit may be
required;
      (7)   Be signed by the permittee, who shall be responsible for the
correctness of the work and for requesting the inspections required in this
chapter;
      (8)   Be accompanied by plans and specifications, including: A map
showing the present elevation of the land and the proposed elevations of the
land after completion of the proposed grading; a plot plan showing the location
of the grading boundaries, lot lines, neighboring public ways and sufficient
dimensions and other data to show the location of all work; description of the
type and classification of soil in Chapter 29 of the Uniform Building Code;
details and location of proposed drainage structures, piping, walls and
cribbing; and such other information that the engineer may require to carry out
the purpose of this chapter. All plans shall bear the name of the person
responsible therefor and shall be submitted to the Engineer in duplicate.
Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, all such plans and specifications
shall be prepared by a registered civil engineer. Exception: The Engineer may
waive the requirement for any or all plans and specifications if the
information on the application is sufficient to show that the work will conform
to the provisions of this chapter. This exception shall not relieve an
applicant of any duty to comply with subdivision and zoning laws and
ordinances, or any other ordinances or state laws which may be applicable;
      (9)   Be accompanied by a preliminary soil report prepared by a
registered soils engineer, which shall be based on adequate test borings or
excavations. The report may be waived if the available information as to the
qualities of the soil satisfies the Engineer that no preliminary analysis is
necessary.
         (a)   If the preliminary soil report indicates the presence of
critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected,
would lead to structural defects, than a soil investigation and report shall be
required for each site. The soil investigation and report shall be prepared by
a registered soils engineer. The report shall recommend corrective action which
is likely to prevent structural damage to any structure to be constructed on
the expansive soil.
         (b) The soil investigation and report shall be approved if the
Engineer determines that the recommended action will likely prevent structural
damage to any improvement to be constructed. As a condition to the issuance of
a building permit, the approved recommended action shall be incorporated in the
construction of any improvement on the site.
   (B)   When an erosion and sedimentation control permit is required by  §
15.28.050, the provisions of said permit shall supersede conflicting provisions
of any other permit. The application shall be accompanied by plans and
specifications prepared by a registered civil engineer. The plans and
specifications shall describe in detail specific erosion and sedimentation
prevention practices to ensure the effective control of soil losses within the
tolerable limits prescribed in  §
15.28.075. The developer shall be guided by the principles of erosion
prevention described in the following subdivisions or by any other acceptable
principles or practices.
      (1)   The erosion and sedimentation control plan should be fitted to the
topography and soil class so as to create the least potential for soil loss.
Maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize inevitable soil loss
through land disturbing activity, such as:
         (a)   Natural vegetation should be retained wherever possible;
         (b)   Where inadequate natural vegetation exists, or where it becomes
necessary to remove existing natural vegetation, temporary vegetation or
mulching should be installed promptly to minimize inevitable soil loss and to
ensure that soil losses are kept below the tolerable limits;
         (c)   Erosion control elements shall be implemented as soon as
practical in the development process, except that the time elapsed shall not
exceed 60 days after the cessation, termination or completion of grading,
whichever comes first.
      (2)   Exposure of the soil through land disturbing activity should be
held to the smallest practicable area and to the shortest practicable period of
time consistent with maximum tolerable soil loss levels.
      (3)   Appropriate provision should be made to accommodate increased storm
water runoff and consequent soil loss occasioned by changed soil and surface
conditions during and after development. In addition to the use of vegetation
and limitations on soil exposure as prescribed herein, such provisions may
include but are not limited to:
         (a)   Scheduling permanent improvements such as streets, storm sewers,
curb and gutters, and other features for control of storm runoff, before
removing vegetative cover from the area;
         (b)   Installing and maintaining sediment basins, debris basins,
desilting basins or silt traps to substantially reduce sediment from runoff
water.
   (C)   Whenever an erosion and sedimentation control permit is required, a
security deposit of $1,000 per acre for land within the limits of grading shall
be required to guarantee that provisions of the permit are met. Any measures
which are temporary and portable, such as sand bags and Visquine, may be
deposited so as to not interfere with normal construction activity during dry
weather. However, any necessary measures shown on the approved plan shall be in
place during any storm event.
      (1)   If those erosion control measures shown on the plan are not in
place within 24 hours of the prediction of a storm event by the U.S. Weather
Service, the City Engineer may have such measures installed and charge any
costs thereof against the security deposit.
      (2)   If any sedimentation does collect in the public right-of-way, it
shall be cleaned up within 24 hours of the end of each storm event. Failure to
do so may permit the City Engineer to have the street cleaned and charge any
costs thereof against the security deposit.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.070) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.075 SOIL LOSS STANDARDS.
   An average of five tons of soil loss per acre per year shall be deemed the
maximum tolerable level of soil erosion during development. The universal soil
loss equation shall be used in determining the average soil loss. The
calculation shall be based on average anticipated losses during the period of
development and one year following development.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.075) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.080 PERMIT—ISSUANCE.
   The application, and plans and specifications for a permit under this
chapter shall be checked by the Engineer. Such plans may be reviewed by other
departments of the city to check compliance with the laws and ordinances under
their jurisdiction. If the Engineer is satisfied that the work described in the
application and the plans filed therewith conform to the requirements of this
chapter and other applicable laws and ordinances, and that the fee specified in
§
15.28.090 has been paid, the Engineer shall issue a grading permit therefor.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.080) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.090 PERMIT—FEE.
   The applicant for a grading permit, under  §
15.28.070, or an erosion and sedimentation control permit, under  §
15.28.075, shall pay the following fees to the city:
   (A)   Plan check fee. Whenever a permit is required by this chapter, the
applicant shall pay a fee established by Council resolution to defray the cost
of engineering and plan checking. The plan check fee shall be paid at the time
of filing the application for the permit.
   (B)   Inspection fee. The applicant shall pay a fee established by Council
resolution to defray the cost of engineering and inspection. The inspection fee
shall be paid at the time of issuance of the permit.
   (C)   If the permit is allowed to expire pursuant to  §
15.28.100, the inspection fee shall be refunded, less any direct costs incurred
by the city.
   (D)   If all improvements approved under the grading permit, including all
public improvements, are not completed by the date shown on the construction
schedule, then an additional inspection fee, equal to the actual cost to the
city, shall be required. The amount of such additional fees shall be deducted
from the security deposit.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.090) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.100 PERMIT—EXPIRATION.
   Every grading permit shall expire and become null and void if the work
authorized by such permit has not been commenced within 60 days of the time
shown on the construction schedule, or at such time that a revised construction
schedule indicates that an erosion and sedimentation control permit is required
pursuant to  §
15.28.070; except that the Engineer may, if the permit holder presents
satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work from being
started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable
extension of time on said permit; provided that the application for the
extension of time is made before the date of expiration of the permit and an
erosion and sedimentation control permit is obtained when required.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.100) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.110 PERMIT—DENIAL.
   The Engineer shall deny a grading permit in any case where the work, as
proposed by the applicant, is likely to endanger any private or public
property, result in the deposition of debris thereon, remove or reduce lateral
support or interfere with any drainage course. Factors to be considered in
making such findings shall include, but shall not be limited to possible
saturation by rains, earth movement, runoff of surface waters, and subsurface
conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock, and nature and type
of soil or rock. Failure of the Engineer to observe or recognize hazardous
conditions or to fail to deny the grading permit shall not relieve the owner or
his or her agent from responsibility for the condition or damages resulting
therefrom, and shall not result in the city being responsible for the condition
or damages resulting therefrom.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.110) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.120 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The Engineer shall, when requested, make the inspections required in
this section, and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or
shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with this chapter.
Where it is found by inspection that the soil or other conditions are not as
stated or shown in the application, the Engineer may immediately order all work
to cease until approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to
the existing conditions.
   (B)   Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of approval of the Engineer,
shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the grading work and
until the work has been approved. The permittee shall notify the Engineer in
order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule and at
least 24 hours before said inspection is to be made:
      (1)   Initial inspection. When the permittee or his agent is ready to
begin work on an excavation or fill;
      (2)   Rough grading. When all rough grading has been completed;
      (3)   Special structures. When excavations are complete for retaining and
crib walls and when reinforcing steel is in place and before concrete is
poured;
      (4)   Final inspection. When all work, including slope planting and
installation of drainage and other structures has been completed.
   (C)   Compaction of fills which were approved by the engineer in accordance
with  §
15.28.180 shall be inspected by a registered soils engineer. A report prepared
and signed by said soils engineer shall be submitted to the Engineer upon
completion of the work and shall include the following:
      (1)   A contour map showing the original and finished surfaces of the
areas filled, unless such map has previously been filed as part of the
application for the grading permit;
      (2)   The foundation bearing values recommended for the compacted fill;
      (3)   A description of the materials used in the fill and the procedure
of deposit and compaction, including the preparation of original ground surface
before making the fill;
      (4)   A plan showing the location of tests made in the fill together with
a tabulation of compaction test results;
      (5)   A statement that all work was done in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.120) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.130 SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS REQUIRED.
   If at any stage of the work the Engineer determines that the nature of the
formation is such that further work, as authorized by an existing grading
permit, may expose to risk any property or public way, the Engineer may
immediately order all work to cease, and require as a condition to allowing
further work to be done, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken as
considered advisable by the Engineer. Special precautions may include but shall
not be limited to a flatter exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, slope planting, sprinkler systems, berms, terracing, compaction or
cribbing.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.130) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.140 CERTIFICATION BY ENGINEER.
   If, upon final inspection of any excavation or fill, it is found that the
work authorized by the grading permit has been satisfactorily completed in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter, and any other requirements
imposed, the Engineer shall so certify. Such certification is required before
any building permit may be granted.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.140) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.150 REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATION.
   The Engineer shall have the power to revoke such certification whenever the
work is found to have been materially extended or altered without obtaining
necessary permits from the city or that any of the work included in the grading
permit has not been maintained in good condition and repair as specified in  §
15.28.040.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.150) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.160 LIABILITY INSURANCE AND CERTIFICATE.
   (A)   Insurance. Whenever in the hilly or mountainous areas of the city, any
grading is proposed for the establishing, enlarging, or changing of building
sites, roadways, yards, drainage facilities or other improvements, the
developer shall be required to provide public liability insurance in such
amounts as the City Council, upon the advice and recommendation of the
Engineer, or in such instances as involve a hearing before the Planning
Commission, upon the advice and recommendation of the Planning Commission and
Engineer, may find to be reasonably necessary to protect persons and property
which may be damaged by rain, floods, the flow of mud or debris, earth slides,
and similar forces and events, caused by or contributed to by the excavation,
fill or grading. Said liability insurance shall be provided by the developer
for a period of one year after a notice of completion of work done under this
chapter has been approved by the City Council.
   (B)   Insurance certificate. A certificate of insurance as required in
division (A) of this section, issued by a corporation authorized to do
insurance business within the state, which certificate shall provide that the
insurance thereby represented will not be canceled, reduced, or allowed to
expire, shall be filed with the city before any permits under this chapter may
be issued or authorized. All such insurance certificates shall be submitted to
the City Attorney for approval before acceptance by the city. Said insurance
shall insure to the benefit of any and all persons or property injured as a
result of water or drainage damage, the flow of mud or debris, or earth slides,
resulting from or contributed to by such excavation, fill or grading. The
certificate shall designate the city as additional insured.
   (C)   Insurance policy. The policy of insurance shall be submitted which
fully describes coverages and exclusions.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.160) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.170 EXCAVATIONS.
   (A)   No excavation shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper
in slope than one and one-half horizontal to one vertical. The Engineer may
require an excavation to be made with a cut-face flatter in slope if the
Engineer finds that the material in which the excavation is to be made is
unusually subject to erosion, or if other conditions warrant a flatter slope
for stability and safety.
   (B)   Excavations shall not extend below the angle of repose, or natural
slope, of the soil under the nearest point of any footing or foundation of any
building or of the soil under the nearest point of any footing or foundation of
any building or structure, unless such footing or foundation is first properly
underpinned or protected against settlement in a manner satisfactory to the
Engineer.
   (C)   No cut slope shall be constructed over 30 feet in height unless the
Engineer has been furnished satisfactory evidence by a qualified geologist or
soils engineer that such slope will be stable. If the soil structure so
requires, as determined by the Engineer, terraces not less than five feet in
width shall be constructed in all cut slopes at the rate of one terrace for
each 20 feet of height (or portion thereof) above 20 feet.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.170) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.180 FILLS.
   (A)   No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in
slope than two horizontal to one vertical. The Engineer may require a fill to
be constructed with an exposed surface flatter in slope if such flatter slope
is determined to be necessary for stability and safety.
   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, no fill shall be made with
materials other than clean soil or earth.
   (C)   No fill slope shall be constructed over 30 feet in height unless the
Engineer has been furnished satisfactory evidence by a qualified geologist or
soils engineer that such slope will be stable. Terraces not less than five feet
in width shall be constructed in all fill slopes at the rate of one terrace for
each 20 feet of height (or portion thereof) above 20 feet.
   (D)   All fills intended to support buildings or structures, or where
otherwise required by the Engineer to be compacted for stability of material,
shall be compacted, inspected and tested in accordance with the following
provisions:
      (1)   All timber, logs, trees, brush, objectionable amounts of vegetable
matter and other rubbish shall be removed from the site, so as to leave the
area free from all debris. All soft, spongy or other unsuitable matter shall be
removed to a depth required to produce a stable subgrade.
      (2)   The subgrade surface shall be scarified to a depth of at least six
inches, if necessary to free the surface from ruts, hummocks or other uneven
features which would tend to prevent uniform compaction by the equipment to be
used.
      (3)   Where fills are made of slopes greater than one vertical to five
horizontal, steps or benches shall be cut in the original ground before filling
operations begin. The design of such steps or benches shall be subject to
review and approval by the Engineer.
      (4)   The prepared surface shall be compacted in the same manner and to
the same degree as required for the fill material.
      (5)   The fill material shall be placed in layers having a maximum
compacted thickness of six inches. Compaction shall be by sheepsfoot roller or
other approved method.
      (6)   The moisture content of the fill material shall be controlled at
the time of spreading and compaction to obtain the required maximum density.
      (7)   The fill material, after compaction, shall have a minimum density
of 90%, as determined by the Modified AASHO Soil Compaction Test, or other
approved testing method.
      (8)   A written report of the compaction as specified in  §
15.28.120 shall be submitted to the Engineer for review and approval.
   (E)   The Engineer may request additional test information, or may modify or
delete any of the above provisions, if the site conditions or materials so
warrant. However, in no case shall the Engineer approve a slope steeper than
that called for in this chapter without the Planning Commission first finding
that the steeper slope would lead to an improvement in the overall quality of
the development. A steeper slope may be permitted only if two reports prepared
by registered soils engineers concur that minimum factors of safety exist for
both surficial and gross stability. The cost of both reports shall be borne by
the developer.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.180) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.190 RETAINING WALLS OR CRIBBING.
   Retaining walls or cribbing shall be constructed in accordance with the
provisions of the Building Code and shall be used whenever necessary to prevent
the surface of any excavation or fill from exceeding the maximum allowable
slopes set forth in this chapter.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.190) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.200 DRAINAGE PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface waters from
damaging the cut face of an excavation or the sloping surface of a fill. All
drainage provisions shall be of such design as to carry surface waters to the
nearest practical street, storm drain or natural watercourse approved by the
Engineer as a safe place to deposit and receive such waters, or to permit the
flow of surface waters onto adjoining property in its normal manner, direction,
location and volume. The Engineer may require such drainage structures or
facilities to be constructed or installed which, in the opinion of the
Engineer, are necessary to prevent erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry
off surface waters.
   (B)   Where pads or terraces are constructed, surface drainage shall not be
permitted to sheet flow over the lower slope. Such drainage shall be carried
laterally across the pad or terrace. When required by the City Engineer,
terraces shall be paved.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.200) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.210 SLOPE PLANTING.
   All fill slopes shall be planted with approved ground cover, unless
specifically exempted by the Engineer. In addition, the Engineer may require
planting with approved ground cover for any cut slope to improve stability or
to reduce erosion and runoff. In all cases where slope planting is required,
approved sprinkler systems shall be installed to adequately water such
planting. A landscape and irrigation plan shall be submitted to the Development
Review Committee for approval.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.210) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.220 CORRECTION OF UNSAFE CONDITION.
   Whenever the Engineer determines that any construction activity or site
condition has become a hazard to life, safety, usability or stability of a
public way, the owner of the property upon which such excavation or fill is
located, or other person in control of said property, upon receipt of notice in
writing from the Engineer, shall immediately repair or reconstruct such
excavation or fill so that it will conform to the requirements of this chapter
or otherwise repair, reconstruct, strengthen or eliminate such hazard and
charge the cost of doing so against the security deposit. The city shall not be
responsible for any additional costs that accrue to the developer as a result
of its action to correct an unsafe condition.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.220) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.230 APPEALS.
   The Planning Commission shall consider appeals from the provisions of this
chapter or from the determinations of the Engineer in the manner specified in
Chapter 2.52 of this code.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.230) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.240 RETENTION OF PLANS.
   Plans and specifications for grading which, in the opinion of the engineer,
are of sufficient size or importance, and all plans, specifications and reports
of compacted fill designed to support a building or other structure, shall be
retained in the office of the City Engineer.
(`83 Code, § 15.28.240) (Ord. 85-11 § 1 (part), 1985)
§ 15.28.250 VIOLATIONS—PENALTY.
   Any person, firm or corporation, whether as principal, agent, employee, or
otherwise, violating or causing the violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be
punishable as provided in  §
1.16.010 of this code. Such person shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense
for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of this
chapter is committed or continued by such person, firm or corporation and shall
be punished as provided in this section.

§ 15.40.010 FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
   Mobile home owners make considerable investments in purchasing, maintaining
and improving their mobile homes, but must rent a space for the home in a
mobile home park and cannot easily move the mobile home due to the shortage of
mobile home spaces and the high cost and risk of damage involved in moving a
mobile home. In recognition of the unique situation and vulnerability of mobile
home owners created by these facts, the State Mobile Home Residency Law, Cal.
Civil Code §§ 798 et seq. and Cal. Gov't Code §§ 65863.7 and 66427.4, limit the
grounds on which mobile home owners may be evicted from a mobile home park,
protect their right to sell their mobile homes in place in a mobile home park
and authorize local jurisdictions to impose reasonable measures to mitigate the
adverse impacts on displaced mobile home owners when a mobile home park closes
or converts to another use. Pursuant to these state laws, this chapter provides
a procedure and standards for reviewing applications for change of use and
closure of mobile home parks, determining reasonable mitigation measures and
protecting residents from tactics such as intimidation and excessive rent
increases, designed to pressure mobile home owners to relocate without
receiving assistance pursuant to this chapter. Without such assistance, mobile
home owners may lose the investment in their homes, which may be their only
asset, and may not be able to relocate to decent, affordable housing.

chapter must be filed with the director. No application shall be deemed
complete or processed for consideration and approval until an application and
RIR meeting all the requirements of this chapter have been filed. No oral or

City Council, by resolution, may impose a fee for review of the application and
RIR.
   (B)   The RIR shall contain the following information:
      (1)   A description of any proposed new use;
      (2)   A timetable for conversion of the park;

      (7)   The total number of mobile home residents, broken down space by
space to identify the owner or renter occupancy, principal or second home
occupancy, residents under 16 years of age, residents 60 years of age or over,
residents who are handicapped, the purchase date and price paid by the mobile
home owner, the cost incurred by the mobile home owner in improving the home

tenant, mobile home resident, resident mobile home owner and legal owner of a
mobile home in the park;
      (9)   The purchase price of condominiums similar in size to the mobile
homes within a reasonable distance, and the rental rates and moving costs

§ 15.40.040 (RESERVED)
§ 15.40.050 NOTICE TO NEW OCCUPANTS REGARDING PENDING CHANGE IN STATUS OF
PARK—RELOCATION ASSISTANCE.
   When an application for change of use of a mobile home park has been filed
with the Director, the applicant shall give notice to all prospective mobile
home purchasers and prospective mobile home tenants within the park, prior to
commencement of escrow to purchase the home and execution of any rental
agreement, that the application for change of use has been filed and that they
may not be entitled to relocation assistance pursuant to this chapter. The park
owner shall obtain a signed acknowledgment of receipt of such notice from each
prospective purchaser or tenant and shall file it with the Director.
(`83 Code, § 15.40.050) (Ord. 92-13 § 1 (part), 1992; Ord. 92-13U § 1 (part),
1992)
§ 15.40.060 APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTION FROM RELOCATION ASSISTANCE OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Any person who files an application for change of use may,
simultaneously with such application, file an application for total or partial
exemption from the obligation to provide relocation assistance.
   (B)   If such application is filed, notice thereof, containing the
information contained in the application, shall be given pursuant to §
15.40.070(B) and (C).
   (C)   An application for total exemption may be made on one of two grounds.
      (1)   That imposition of any relocation obligations would eliminate
substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for
alternate uses;
      (2)   The park is exempt from the requirement of relocation assistance
under state law governing changes of use of mobile home park.
   (D)   Any application for partial exemption shall state that it is made on
grounds that imposition of particular relocation obligations would eliminate
substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for
alternate uses. The application shall specify the particular relocation
obligations which would cause this result.
   (E)   An application for exemption made pursuant to divisions (C)(1) and (D)
of this section shall contain, at a minimum, an estimate of the value of the
mobile home park by a qualified real estate appraiser if the park were
permitted to be developed for the use proposed in the application for change of
use, or other use consistent with applicable zoning, and an estimate of the
value of such park by such appraiser if use of the property as a mobile home
park is continued. An application for exemption pursuant to division (C)(2) of
this section shall specify the provision of state law providing the claimed
exemption and documentation demonstrating entitlement to such exemption.
   (F)   The application for exemption shall be heard at the same time and in
the same manner as the application for change of use, except that where
entitlement to exemption under state law is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Director, no RIR shall be required.
(`83 Code, § 15.40.060) (Ord. 92-13 § 1 (part), 1992; Ord. 92-13U § 1 (part),
1992)
§ 15.40.070 APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF USE—PUBLIC HEARING—FINDINGS.
   (A)   Upon the filing of an application for change of use or exemption and
RIR, the Director shall examine the same and advise the applicant in writing
within 30 days after receipt thereof whether it is complete. When an
application and RIR have been accepted as complete, the Director shall set a
time, date and place for a hearing before the Planning Commission not later
than 60 days after the date of acceptance. Because certain required information
in an RIR (e.g., appraisals, tenant data) can not be obtained until after
filing an application for change of use, an applicant must file an application
for change of use and RIR containing all available information concerning the
proposed change of use and relocation costs and assistance in order to start
the process of obtaining the information required for a complete application
and RIR.
   (B)   Not less than 30 days prior to the scheduled public hearing before the
Planning Commission, the park owner shall, by certified mail or personal
delivery, transmit to the registered and legal owner of each mobile home
occupying a site within the mobile home park and to each resident a copy of the
RIR and notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing on the
application.
   (C)   Not less than 15 days prior to the scheduled public hearing before the
Planning Commission on the RIR, the park owner shall file with the Director a
verification that he or she has complied with the requirements of this section
pertaining to notices and transmittal of copies of the RIR and with all notice
requirements in Cal. Gov't Code §§ 65863.7 et seq. The form and manner of such
verification shall be subject to approval by the City Attorney.
   (D)   Planning Commission hearing, findings and advisory decision. Upon
review of an application for change of use or exemption and the RIR and
consideration of the written and oral evidence received at the hearing, the
Commission shall render its findings and recommendations to the City Council by
resolution within 95 days of the date the application and RIR were accepted as
complete. In rendering its advisory decision, the Commission may recommend
reasonable measures not exceeding the reasonable costs of relocation to
mitigate the adverse impacts on eligible residents displaced by the change of
use, which may include, but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Payment of the cost of physically moving the mobile home to a new
site, including tear-down and set-up of mobile homes, including, but not
limited to movable improvements such as patios, carports and porches;
      (2)   Payment of a lump sum based on consideration of the first and last
month's rent and any security deposit at the new mobile home park;
      (3)   Payment of a lump sum based on consideration of any differential
between rental rates at the closing mobile home park and the new mobile home
park during the first year of the new tenancy;
      (4)   For those mobile home residents who move to apartments or other
rental housing alternatives, payment of a lump sum based on consideration of
any differential in the rental rate between the closing park and the alternate
housing, requirements for payment of the first and last month's rent and
security deposits and cleaning fees, and the Fair Market Rents for new
construction and substantial rehabilitation for the Los Angeles area as
established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mobile
home households may be compensated based on the number of bedrooms in the
mobile home so that a one-bedroom mobile home may be compensated based on a
one-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom mobile home based on a two-bedroom
apartment, and the like;
      (5)   Provision of a replacement space within a reasonable distance of
the closing mobile home park;
      (6)   For residents whose mobile home cannot be relocated to a comparable
park within a 50-mile radius of the closing mobile home park, payment of a lump
sum based upon consideration of the value of the mobile home, including
resident improvements (i.e., landscaping, porches, carports, and the like), any
mortgage obligations of the resident on the mobile home, and the costs of
purchasing a mobile home on-site in a comparable park or acquiring other
comparable replacement housing;
      (7)   Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, the total of
the mitigation measures required shall be subject to and shall not exceed the
limitation in Cal. Gov't Code § 65863.7 which provides: “the steps taken to
mitigate shall not exceed the reasonable costs of relocation.”
   (E)   City Council hearing, findings and decision.
      (1)   The application for change of use and any application for exemption
shall be set for hearing before the City Council within 45 days of the date of
the Planning Commission resolution recommending the mitigation measures to be
imposed on the change of use of a park or exemption from the provision of
relocation assistance.
      (2)   The City Council, after review and consideration of the
application, the RIR and the written and oral evidence received at the hearing,
shall by resolution render its findings and decision within 80 days of the date
of the Planning Commission resolution.
      (3)   The City Council may impose reasonable measures not exceeding the
reasonable costs of relocation to mitigate the adverse impacts of the change of
use on eligible mobile home residents pursuant to division (D) of this section.
The decisions of the City Council shall be final. Pursuant to Cal. Code of
Civil Procedure § 1094.6, the statute of limitations for bringing a judicial
challenge to any decision concerning a change of use of a mobile home park
shall be 90 days and notice of the city's decision to the application, park
owner, and affected residents shall include notice that the 90-day statute of
limitations in Cal. Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.6 is applicable.

1992)
§ 15.40.080 MEASURES TO PREVENT AVOIDANCE OF RELOCATION ASSISTANCE OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   No notice or other announcement that a park is closing, or converting
to another use, or may close or convert to another use, may be made before the
park owner has filed an application for change of use with the city. No signs
may be posted on or adjacent to the park property indicating that the park is
closed or may be closing or converting to another use until the Director has
accepted the application and RIR as complete and the park owner has executed
and filed with the Director a written acceptance of the mitigation requirements
imposed on the change of use pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Any eligible resident who relocates after an application for a change
of use is filed shall be entitled to the relocation assistance imposed as a
condition of the change of use even if that resident relocates before the final
decision of the City Council determining the required relocation assistance
pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A copy of this chapter shall be given to each existing and new
resident of the park. Signed acknowledgment of receipt of such copy by each
existing resident shall be filed with the Director within 25 days of the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. A signed
acknowledgment of such copy by each new resident shall be filed with the
Director within 15 days of the date the new resident enters a rental agreement
with a park or lawfully occupies a mobile home in the park.
   (D)   No prospective mobile home resident who enters escrow to purchase a
mobile home in a park prior to the date an application for change of use is
filed and no existing mobile home resident may be required to sign a waiver, or
a lease or rental agreement which includes a waiver, of their rights under this
chapter. Any waiver of rights under this chapter by such a mobile home resident
shall be deemed invalid unless the resident or prospective resident and the
park owner obtain the prior approval of the waiver from the Director, who may
grant such approval only upon a finding that the waiver is voluntary and was
made after being fully informed of the terms of this chapter.
   (E)   A petition may be filed by 51% of the eligible mobile home resident
households in a park for review of any rent increase which exceeds 20% of the
existing rent or which is imposed sooner than 12 months after the last rent
increase and which, when combined with the last rent increase, totals an
increase of more than 20% of the rent prior to the last rent increase. The
petition must be filed with the Director within 15 days after notice of the
rent increase is given by the park owner and must contain sufficient
information to allow the Director to determine whether the rent increase which
is the subject of the petition meets the criteria of this division and shall
include the following information:
      (1)   The number of eligible resident households in the park;
      (2)   The space number and members of each eligible resident household
signing the petition;
      (3)   The signature of one adult member of each eligible resident
household signing the petition;
      (4)   The date of notice and amount of the rent increase that is the
subject of the petition;
      (5)   The amount of the existing rent, the date(s) of any increase
imposed during the immediately preceding 12 months and the amount of the rent
before those increases were imposed;
      (6)   The Director shall give notice of the petition by certified mail or
personal delivery to the park owner and the eligible resident of the park
within 15 days of the date it is received. The notice shall state the
Director's preliminary determination whether the petition meets the criteria of
this subsection. If the Director's preliminary determination is that it does
meet the criteria, the notice shall include notice of the hearing date before
the Planning Commission not sooner than 50 and no later than 80 days after the
date the petition was received, notice that the park owner has 30 days in which
to provide justification for the rent increase pursuant to division (E)(7) of
this section and notice that the noticed increase cannot be charged, demanded,
collected or retained unless and until approved by the Commission. If the
Director's preliminary determination is that the petition does not meet the
criteria of division (E)(7) of this section, or is incomplete, the notice shall
state that the petition is being rejected and the reasons for the rejection. In
such case, the petitioners may submit a revised petition, which cures the
reason for rejection, within ten days of receipt of the rejection notice. The
revised petition shall be processed in the same manner as the original.
      (7)   In reviewing a rent increase petition, the Commission shall approve
such increases as are required to provide a “just and reasonable” or “fair”
return on investment to the park owner and shall consider all relevant factors,
including but not limited to the following:
         (a)   Changes in the CPI since the last rent increase;
         (b)   The rent charged for comparable mobile home spaces in the city
and surrounding areas;
         (c)   The completion of any capital improvements in the park since the
last rent increases, the costs of which is not reimbursable by insurance;
         (d)   Changes in operating and maintenance expenses;
         (e)   The need for unusual repairs or rehabilitation, the cost of
which is not reimbursable by insurance;
         (f)   Changes in the housing services and amenities provided in the
park since the last increase;
         (g)   The need for an increase to provide a fair return on investment
as shown by the return being earned by comparable parks, with investment
defined as purchase price adjusted by the increase in the CPI since the
purchase date, plus the cost of any capital improvements to the park since the
purchase date.
      (8)   The Commission shall render its findings and decision by resolution
within 100 days of the date the petition was received by the Director. The
decision of the Commission shall be final.
      (9)   The provision of this division (E) shall not apply to spaces
subject to a lease exempt from local rent regulations pursuant to the Mobile
Home Residency Law, Cal. Civil Code §§ 798 et seq., shall not apply to spaces
first held out for rent after January 1, 1990, or the rent first charged to a
purchaser of a mobile home in the park or for a vacant space, provided that the
rent thereafter charged to these new residents shall be subject to this
division (E), and provided further that a space shall not be deemed vacant when
an existing mobile home resident removes his or her mobile home to replace it
with a new mobile home.
      (10)   An eligible resident may refuse to pay any rent in excess of the
maximum rent permitted by division (D) of this section. The fact that such
unpaid rent is in excess of the maximum rent permitted by division (D) shall be
a defense in any action brought to recover possession of a mobile home space
and for nonpayment of rent or to collect the illegal rent.
      (11)   The statute of limitations applicable to a judicial challenge of
any decision made pursuant to this section shall be 90 days as set forth in §
15.40.070(E)(3) and notice of the Commission's decision to the park owner and
affected residents shall state that the 90-day statute of limitations in Cal.
Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.6 is applicable.

§ 15.40.090 COMPLIANCE WITH RELOCATION ASSISTANCE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF
APPROVAL OF A CHANGE OF USE.
   (A)   The applicant shall execute and record a certificate, and file proof
thereof with the Director, accepting the mitigation measures imposed on the
approval of a change of use within 90 days of the final resolution approving
the change of use and shall give the six-month notice of the “Termination of
Tenancy” and closure of the park required by the Cal. Civil Code within 120
days of the adoption of that resolution. A resolution approving a change of use
shall automatically become null and void if the certificate accepting the
conditions is not filed and executed within 90 days of the date of the final
resolution approving the change of use and the notice of “Termination of
Tenancy” has not been given within 120 days of that resolution. All mitigation
measures imposed on the approval of a change of use shall be fully performed as
to each resident prior to that resident's required vacation of the mobile home
park, unless otherwise provided in the mitigation measure. No eligible resident
shall be required to vacate a mobile home space unless the applicant is in full
compliance with all mitigation measures imposed pertaining to such resident,
and has otherwise fulfilled the notice requirements of the California Mobile
Home Residency Law relating to “Termination of Tenancy.”
   (B)   No building permit shall be issued for the development of any real
property which has been, or is being, converted from a mobile home park
pursuant to this chapter unless and until the city has adopted a resolution
approving the change of use and the park owner has fully complied with the
relocation assistance required by that resolution.

§ 15.40.100 MODIFICATION AND REVOCATION OF APPROVED CHANGE OF USE.
   (A)   Modification.
      (1)   After a change of use has been approved and after the applicant has
executed and recorded a certificate of acceptance of the conditions of the
resolution approving it, modification of the mitigation measures imposed,
including additions and deletions, may be considered upon the filing of a
written application by the applicant. Modification may be granted on the
grounds that there has been a change in circumstances or new information, which
could not reasonably have been known or considered at the time of the hearings
on the application, has become available. Examples of such new information or
changed circumstances include, but are not limited to revised plans by the
applicant and a change in the availability of relocation spaces. Modification
shall not be granted when it would unreasonably prejudice the ability of the
residents to relocate to comparable spaces or comparable alternate housing.
      (2)   Any application for modification shall be subject to the notice and
hearing procedures set forth in §§
15.40.070 and
15.40.080. The decision in connection with a modification request shall take
place as with the initial approval.
   (B)   Revocation.
      (1)   The City Council may by resolution initiate revocation proceedings
on the grounds that the park owner or applicant has violated the provisions of
this chapter or the terms of the resolution approving the change of use. The
resolution shall specify the grounds asserted for revocation of the approval of
the change of use by the park and shall set a hearing before the City Council
to consider the revocation not sooner than 45 and not later than 60 days after
the date of the resolution.
      (2)   A copy of the resolution shall be sent to the park owner by
certified mail or personal delivery together with notice that any response by
the park must be filed at least 20 days prior to the date set for the
revocation hearing.
      (3)   The City Council shall render its findings and decision concerning
revocation by resolution within 90 days after initiating revocation
proceedings.

§ 15.40.110 EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF APPROVAL.
   (A)   Approval of a change of use shall become null and void if the notice
of “Termination of Tenancy” has not been given within the time provided in §
15.40.090 and relocation pursuant to the conditions of approval has not
occurred within 12 months of the effective date of the resolution approving the
change of use, unless otherwise extended as provided in division (B) of this
section, or unless otherwise provided in the resolution approving it.
   (B)   Upon application by the park owner filed with the Director on or
before the time provided for giving the notice of termination or the expiration
of the approval of the change of use, the date for giving notice and the
approval may be extended by the City Council upon a showing of good cause. The
request may be denied if the Council finds that the park owner has unreasonably
delayed implementation of the mitigation measures or that further delay will
result in prejudice or further adverse impacts upon eligible residents
remaining in the park. Approval of an extension may be conditioned on
reasonable measures designed to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from the
delay. The application for extension shall be subject to the notice and hearing

   (A)   The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets and highways shall conform with the General Plan and precise plans
showing the relationship between existing and proposed streets, with
topographic conditions, with the appropriate relationship to abutting land use,
and with all requirements necessary to protect and promote the public health,
safety and convenience.
   (B)   Where local street plans are not shown on the General Plan or on a
precise plan, then the minimum standards and provisions found in this chapter
shall apply.
   (C)   The street arrangement shall be such that in the Commission's judgment
no undue hardships will be worked on the owners of adjoining property.
Consideration shall be made of potential hardships to future development or
subdivision of adjoining property.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.080) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.090 CROSS-SECTIONS FOR STREETS AND HIGHWAYS—STANDARDS.
   Design standards for the various types of streets and highways are related
to the use to which these streets and highways are to be put. These standards
relate to the land use and circulation elements of the General Plan, which
coordinates the type of zone, the kind of use of land permitted therein, the
population density to be provided for, and the purposes of streets and highways
in reference to the community as a whole.
   (A)   Major highways. Major highways shall be paved with a roadway capable
of carrying at least three lanes of vehicular traffic in each direction, and
shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 100 feet, measured on a line
perpendicular to the centerline of the highway in a horizontal plane as more
particularly shown in standard drawings on file in the office of the City
Engineer.
   (B)   Secondary highways. Secondary highways shall be paved with a roadway
capable of carrying at least two lanes of vehicular traffic in each direction,
and shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 84 feet, measured on a line
perpendicular to the centerline of the highway in a horizontal plane as more
particularly shown in standard drawings on file in the office of the City
Engineer.
   (C)   Major traffic streets, collector streets and local streets. Major
traffic streets, collector streets and local streets shall have a minimum
right-of-way width of 60 feet, and a minimum paved roadway width of 40 feet as
more particularly shown in standard drawings on file in the office of the City
Engineer.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.090) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.100 CROSS-SECTIONS FOR STREETS AND HIGHWAYS—EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   In cases where approval of a subdivision of less than five lots
requires the dedication and improvement of a street, and where the uses
proposed in the new subdivision do not materially alter the intensity of the
use of the area, then the Commission may recommend acceptance of street
dedications to a width not greater than that now serving property in the block.
If, however, the subdivision is located on a major traffic street, secondary
highway or major highway, the dedications shall conform to the General Plan.
Improvements shall be to city standards, excepting that curbs and gutters may
be located in conformity with the line and grade of the existing abutting
improvements if so approved by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Where local streets serve 24 or less building sites in single-family
residential areas, the right-of-way width may be reduced to 54 feet, and the
paved roadway width may be reduced to 34 feet, as more particularly shown in
standard drawings on file in the office of the City Engineer.
   (C)   For mountainous areas where there is restricted right-of-way, and
where there are houses or building sites fronting on only once side of such
street, the right-of-way width may be reduced to 44 feet, and the paved roadway
width may be reduced to 32 feet, as more particularly shown in standard
drawings on file in the office of the City Engineer. In this case parking shall
be prohibited on one side of the street.
   (D)   For steep mountainous area where the road grade is 10% or more and
where the side slope is in excess of one foot vertical to four feet horizontal,
the right-of-way may be reduced to 40 feet, and the paved roadway width may be
reduced to 28 feet, as more particularly shown in standard drawings on file in
the office of the City Engineer. In this case, parking shall be prohibited on
one side of the street.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.100) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.110 ALIGNMENT OF STREETS—REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All streets, as far as practicable, shall be required to be in
alignment with existing adjacent streets or their proper projection, and in
general conformity with the General Plan for the city.
   (B)   Where the subdivision is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way or an
approved truck route, or the General Plan indicates that such property may be
used for industrial purposes, highways aligned in the same direction with the
railroad or truck route will be required to be located as nearly parallel to
such routes or rights-of-way as is practicable, and at least one industrial lot
depth or not less than 200 feet distance therefrom.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.110) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.120 HILLSIDE STREETS—REQUIREMENTS.
   Where streets or roads are so constructed that cut or fill banks are not
fully within the right-of-way, such cut and fill banks shall be constructed so
as to:
   (A)   Permit the development of abutting lots as building sites; and
   (B)   Protect the road and the abutting property against slides, erosion and
settlements, all in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.120) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.130 STREET GRADES AND CURVES—REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A maximum street or road grade of 6% is recommended. Grades exceeding
this amount will not be approved except where conclusive proof is given that
conformity with this standard would be impractical. Street grades in excess of
15% shall not be approved.
   (B)   A minimum street and/or road grade of 0.5% is recommended. Grades less
than this amount will not be approved except where conclusive proof is given
that conformity with this standard would be impractical, and that adequate
provisions have been made to handle drainage in the area.
   (C)   A centerline radius of not less than 100 feet shall be required on all
local street curves, except where conclusive proof is given that conformity
with this standard is impractical.

§ 16.24.140 STREET INTERSECTIONS—REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Street intersections shall be at as nearly a right angle as is
possible, and care shall be taken in laying out intersections so that adequate
area is offered for dedication. Grades on collector and local streets at their
point of intersection with major traffic streets or highways shall be reduced
to provide for the safe meshing of traffic and turning movements, and standing
of vehicles as they await opportunities to enter the traffic street.
   (B)   At all block corners there shall be a curb return radius of not less
than 25 feet. At major traffic streets or highway intersections the minimum
curb return radius shall be 35 feet. There shall also be a rounding of the
property lines or a corner cutoff, dedicated to the city for street and highway
purposes to ensure sufficient sight distance.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.140) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.150 CUL-DE-SAC STREETS—REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   When serving land zoned for industrial or commercial use, a cul-de-sac
shall have a maximum length of 450 feet, measured to the center of a turnaround
having a radius of not less than 55 feet for the right-of-way, and 45 feet for
the paved area. The required cross-section is shown in standard drawings on
file in the office of the City Engineer.
   (B)   When serving land zoned for residential uses and having a density of
more than four dwelling units per acre, a cul-de-sac shall have a maximum
length of 700 feet, measured to the center of a turnaround having a radius of
not less than 35 feet for the right-of-way, and 30 feet for the paved area. The
required cross-section is shown in standard drawings on file in the office of
the City Engineer.
   (C)   (1)   When serving land zoned for residential uses and having a
density of four dwelling units or less per acre, a cul-de-sac shall have a
maximum length of 1,000 feet, measured to the center of the turnaround and in
all other respects shall conform to division (B) of this section.
      (2)   The cul-de-sac shall be used only when it is required for the
proper subdivision of land, and provides the necessary requirements for the
protection of the health and safety of affected properties. Any design, whether
conforming to this section or not, is subject to approval by the City Engineer
and Fire Chief.

   The width of all streets offered, for dedication in conformity with this
title shall be determined by the standards set forth in this section. The basis
for all street, highway and road design shall be the lanes. The width of the
lanes shall be related to the use to which the street or roadway will be put,
and to the use of abutting land.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.170) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.180 STREET COMPONENTS—LANES.

lane in this classification shall be not less than 12 feet.
   (B)   Traffic lane on major traffic, collector and local streets. The width
of a traffic lane in this classification shall be not less than 12 feet, except
that in certain cases, when conclusive proof is furnished that conformity with
this standard would be impractical, the width of a traffic lane for local
streets may be reduced to ten feet.
   (C)   Parking lane. Parking lanes shall be a minimum of eight feet in width.
When parking is permitted on major traffic streets and highways where time
limits for parking are established, and where said parking may be prohibited
during peak traffic hours, the parking lane shall be 12 feet in width, so that
it may function as a traffic lane when so required.

16.24.150, but shall in no case be less than four feet in width in a
residential area, nor less than five feet in a commercial or industrial area.
   (B)   Special consideration shall be given to the provision of sidewalks in
subdivisions in mountainous areas or hilly terrain where placement of a walk
along one side of the street may be acceptable to the Commission. Where the
width of the right-of-way is controlled by the topography, the Commission may
recommend exclusion of sidewalks.
   (C)   Sidewalks may be omitted by the Commission in a subdivision of less
than five lots where more than 40% of the contiguous frontage has been
developed and no sidewalks exist.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.210) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)

feet in depth, measured from the frontage on one street to the frontage on the
next closest parallel or nearly parallel street. Where lots back up to a street
or highway and where it is intended that there shall be no access from said lot
to the street or highway against which they back, a five-foot high masonry wall
shall be erected on the rear property line as a physical separation between the
lot and the street or highway in accordance with the standards of the City
Engineer.
   (B)   Blocks, special. Plans for special blocks, called super blocks, may be
submitted to the Commission for approval when such blocks propose special
design features which will provide for greater amenities than those set forth
in the minimum standard provisions of this title and where no hardship is
wrought on the community as a whole by the approval of such super block plans.
   (C)   Walkways. The subdivider may be required to dedicate and improve
walkways across blocks greater than 900 feet in length, in order to provide
more convenient pedestrian access to schools, parks or other public areas.
(`83 Code, § 16.24.260) (Ord. 82-19 § 1 (part), 1982)
§ 16.24.270 LOTS—SPECIFICATIONS—EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   All lots shall have a minimum frontage, minimum width, and a minimum
depth in conformance with the standards established in Title 17 and the General
Plan. Exceptions to this provision are as follows:
      (1)   The requirements for frontage on a dedicated street shall not apply
to lots served by an approved private way;
      (2)   Corner lots shall be at least 14% wider than the minimum
requirements for interior lots in any zone, in order to maintain required
building lines on both front and side streets.
   (B)   All residential lots shall have a minimum area as set forth in the
General Plan and §
17.12.010 of this code. Easements over any such lot for public utility purposes
shall not be considered as a reduction of the required lot area; provided,
however, that said easements shall not cover more than one-sixth of the total
area of such lot.
   (C)   Where lots front on a major or secondary highway as shown on the
General Plan, said lots shall have no direct vehicular access thereto.
Provision shall be made for access by the dedication of alleys to the side or
rear of said lots or by the provision of service roads, separated from and
parallel to the highway.
   (D)   On major traffic, collector and local streets, all lots shall front
upon the street that parallels the long dimension of the block. In the case of
square blocks, the Commission shall determine on the basis of the existing uses
and the purposes established in the general plan which block face shall be
considered as frontage.
   (E)   Flag lots shall not be permitted.
   (F)   Double frontage shall not be permitted except where access rights are
limited to one street.
   (G)   Side lot lines of rectangular lots shall be as nearly perpendicular to
the centerline of the street upon which the lots front as is practical. Side
lot lines of lots fronting on curved streets shall be nearly radial as is
practical.
   (H)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this code, no lot may be created
which has less than 50 feet of frontage on a dedicated street; provided
however, that this provision shall not apply to any lot created as part of an
historic preservation participation incentive in accordance with §
17.40.140 of this code.

§ 16.24.280 PROPERTIES BENEFITED BY SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENTS—REIMBURSEMENT TO
SUBDIVIDER—EXPIRATION.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to foster the orderly
development and proper planning of areas to be subdivided, and to encourage,
without partisanship, the collective subdivision of all adjacent parcels
properly includable under one plan or within one subdivision. To this end the
Commission may recommend and the Council may approve reasonable measures for
reimbursement to a subdivider of the costs incurred by the subdivider in
subdividing property, when such costs are incurred at least in part for the
ultimate benefit of properties not embraced within such subdivision. The proper
development of many areas requires the installation of improvements out of
proportion to the property presently being subdivided, and adequate provision
shall be made for the eventual spreading of such improvement costs over areas
actually benefitted thereby when and if such areas desire to and are ready to
avail themselves of such benefits.
   (B)   Provisions of reimbursement.
      (1)   Properties not within a subdivision, but abutting improvements made
therein at the cost of the subdivider and to be dedicated to the public, shall
be precluded from access to or use of such improvements by:
         (a)   Granting of intervening property in trust to an impartial
corporate title holder upon such conditions as the Council shall find and
determine to be fair and equitable to each subdivider, to the owners of
adjacent properties and to the inhabitants of the city generally or by;
         (b)   Such other or further means as may be lawful and proper.
      (2)   The City Clerk shall cause timely notice of all determinations by
the Council made within the scope of this section to be sent to the owners of
all parcels of the properties deemed by the Council to be in any way benefitted
by the improvements to be constructed in the subdivision.
   (C)   Expiration. Subdivision trusts executed pursuant to this section shall
expire at the end of 25 years from the date of recording thereof. Interest at
the rate of 12% per annum shall be charged on amounts payable under the terms
of such subdivision trusts.

§ 17.12.005 NEIGHBORHOOD COMPATIBILITY DESIGN REVIEW.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.  The preservation of the character of Monrovia's
neighborhoods is an important goal for the community. The purpose of this
chapter is to integrate new development into the context and character of
existing neighborhoods to achieve compatibility. The tools implemented to
address compatibility are intended to provide an approach that balances the
desires of the property owner to develop his or her property with the concerns
of surrounding residents to maintain the character of their neighborhood.
      (1)   The purpose and intent of the neighborhood compatibility design
review is:
         (a)   To preserve the character and charm of the city and its
neighborhoods by establishing processes and criteria to review new construction
to assure that the resulting structures are compatible with the neighborhood
within which they are located.
         (b)   To provide reasonable review of proposals to maximize
compatibility with the unique character of the neighborhood in terms of mass,
scale, height, and design, while generally maintaining neutrality regarding the
architectural style of the proposed development.
         (c)   To minimize privacy impacts of new two-story construction upon
neighboring properties while still maintaining good design.
         (d)   To provide a review process to regulate the development or
redevelopment of properties within existing neighborhoods so as to maximize
visually compatible relationships, and bright, open neighborhoods.
         (e)   To educate applicants regarding their obligation to take into
consideration the potential impacts on their neighbors when modifying
structures or proposing new structures and take reasonable steps to mitigate
such impacts.
      (2)   It is not the intent of this chapter to unreasonably restrict or
regulate the right of an individual property owner to determine the type of
structure or addition desired.
      (3)   The neighborhood compatibility design review process is intended to
be an integral part of the overall design process that should commence with
city staff and the applicant prior to the preparation of any design concepts.
      (4)   The regulations in this section are in addition to the requirements
of other regulations or ordinances of the city and where in conflict the more
restrictive regulations shall apply.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply.

a particular historical period or school of architecture (e.g. Spanish, Tudor)
      REPLACEMENT-IN-KIND. Replacement of any architectural element which is
identical to the original element in terms of its location, size, and shape;
and is made of materials that outwardly have the same dimensions, proportions,
details and textures of the original architectural element and that outwardly
appear unchanged from the original architectural style. If the original design
of a structure and/or element was removed or altered, or if the original design
elements are not known, the replacement element(s) shall be consistent with the
structure's original architectural style.
   (C)   Applicability. On any property in a residential zone or a PD Zone
designated for residential development, no person shall construct any of the
following structures until such structures are found to be compatible pursuant
to this section with the neighborhood within which it is located. Applicable
construction shall be classified into one of the following categories. Specific
review and noticing requirements are established for each category.
      (1)   Existing residential dwelling proposing a single story addition
that affects no more than the rear 50% of the structure.

the pad edge. For structures over 27 feet in height, the second story must be
set back an additional two feet for every additional one foot in height.
         (b)   Toe of slope. In addition to the setback requirements from
property line, setback distances from the toe of slope for the side of a pad
shall be five feet from the toe of the slope to any structures on the pad. No
setback is required for the rear of the pad.
   (E)   Height restrictions.
      (1)   No building shall exceed two stories in height. The maximum
building height is based on lot width as follows:
 
LOT WIDTH       MAXIMUM BUILDING HEIGHT
Less than 75'   27'
75' and greater 30'
 
      (2)   Building height shall be determined by the vertical distance
measured at any point of the proposed roof structure to the exterior or
finished grade at the proposed exterior walls of the structure. No part of a
building (except chimneys) shall extend above an imaginary line drawn at the
maximum building height above finished grade as illustrated in the following
diagram:
[Image]
 
      (3)   Retaining walls. When used to extend the pad area of a lot adjacent
to slope(s) a retaining wall shall not exceed a height of three feet unless the
retaining wall is fully screened by a residence, garage, or other permitted
structure so that the wall cannot be viewed from an adjacent parcel or from any
street.
   (F)   Separation between buildings.
      (1)   Facing walls of separate buildings on the same lot in the RF zone
shall meet separation requirements for each story according to the following
table:
 
             REQUIRED SEPARATION
First story  6'
Second story 20'
 
      (2)   These building separation requirements apply equally to separate
buildings that share a common roof.
   (G)   Hillside Development Standards (properties not covered by a specific
plan). The following shall be required:
      (1)   Conservation of natural topographic features and appearances by
means of land sculpturing to blend graded slopes and benches with natural
topography.
      (2)   Protection of existing vegetation through careful site planning
which may reduce areas of grading.
      (3)   Provision of safe access for vehicular and pedestrian traffic with
minimum of disturbances of the natural terrain. Utilization of street designs
and improvements which serve to minimize grading impact and harmonize with the
natural contours and character of the hillsides. Street standards shall be per
the city's adopted Hillside Development Policies and Standards.
      (4)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to preserve or minimize the
impact on view corridors and scenic vistas. A visual impact analysis shall be
required per the city's adopted Hillside Development Policies and Standards.
      (5)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to preserve mature trees,
especially oaks. Special consideration shall be given to the preservation or
relocation of heritage trees.
      (6)   Cantilevered construction, overhang, exposed structures or stem
wall construction shall not be permitted. Cantilevered decking shall be
permitted only if the line of sight analysis indicates no visual impact or
appropriate mitigation measures can be adopted.
      (7)   Colors of the buildings shall be selected to blend with the natural
colors and hues of the surrounding hillsides.
      (8)   A landscape plan shall be required indicating type and extent of
proposed vegetation. In addition, landscape materials for the coverage and
stabilization of graded slopes shall be approved by the Development Review
Committee.
      (9)   A visual impact analysis shall be required for those dwelling units
which are proposed to be developed in "sensitive" areas. "Sensitive" areas are
those which are higher in elevation and visually exposed to the city-at-large
and could potentially impact existing city-at-large view sheds. Proposed
dwelling units designated as "sensitive" shall be set back from the top of the
slope a distance determined by the line-of-sight analysis in addition to the
required setbacks. The line of sight analysis is not designed to completely
screen or eliminate the view of the dwelling units in sensitive areas. However,
it is designed to minimize the visual impact of building lines by the use of
increased setback, berming, landscaping and building design.
   (H)   Hillside Development permit required. In addition to the requirements
of this chapter, where development proposals require grading of the lot with
five feet or more of cut, five feet or more of fill, or a retaining wall of six
feet in height or higher, approval of a Hillside Development permit is required
for the following:
      (1)   Development of new single-family dwellings.
      (2)   Earth movement that creates a footprint of more than 500 square
feet.
      (3)   Swimming pools and basements are excluded.

§ 3, 1997; Ord. 2001-10 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2001-17 § 4, 2002; Ord. 2004-11 § 4,
2004; Ord. 2016-08 § 21, 2016)
§ 17.12.020 RESIDENTIAL ESTATE (RE) AND RESIDENTIAL LOW-DENSITY (RL) STANDARDS.
   (A)   Lot size.
      (1)   The minimum lot area and dimensions shall be as follows:
 
   MINIMUM LOT AREA   MINIMUM LOT WIDTH MINIMUM LOT DEPTH
RE 20,000 square feet 75 feet           100 feet
RL 7,500 square feet  75 feet           100 feet
 
      (2)   Lot averaging. In the RL and Planned Development Areas with RL zone
designations, a request for the reduction of a minimum lot area or lot width
may be considered through a variance process, if the following criteria are
met:
         (a)   The proposed lots shall meet the average of the block in width
and area, and in no case shall the depth be less than 100 feet. To determine
the average lot size (width and area), the average shall be taken on the same
side of the block, no less than 400 feet on either side of the subject lot.
Two-thirds of the lots, including the subject lot, must be equal to or less
than the width and area of the proposed lots. In cases where the average should
be taken by a radius or other means, based on the subject lot's location, and
proximity to corners, the Development Review Committee shall decide on the
averaging method.
         (b)   The proposed lots shall have frontage on an existing dedicated
street.
         (c)   Averaging shall not be considered if the lot split will result
in the demolition of a house built prior to 1940 that has architectural value.
   (B)   Minimum/maximum floor area. The minimum floor area of a dwelling unit
in the RE and RL zones shall be 1,250 square feet.
   (C)   The maximum floor area of the main building in the RE and RL zones
shall be based on the net lot area and shall be determined using the following
formula: 40% of the net lot area for the first 5,000 square feet of net lot
area, plus an additional 35% of the net lot area for the next 5,000 square feet
of net lot area, plus an additional 15% of the remaining net lot area.
      (1)   Attached garages and other attached, enclosed accessory buildings
shall be calculated as main building floor area. If the garage is attached to
the rear of the structure and is not visible from the street, then up to 400
square feet of the garage floor area may be added to the maximum floor area
allowed for the primary structure.
   (D)   Accessory buildings.
      (1)   In the RL and RE zones, the floor area ratio for all accessory
buildings shall not exceed the percentages shown in the following table.
 
MAXIMUM ACCESSORY BUILDING F.A.R.
LOT SIZE           FLOOR AREA RATIO
Under one acre     10%
                   (2,000 square foot maximum)
One acre and above 8%
 
      (2)   In no case shall detached accessory structures exceed 80% of the
main building floor area.
      (3)   Attached garages shall be counted toward the total accessory
building floor area as well as part of the main building area notwithstanding
the minimized visible garage provisions in §
17.12.040(C).
   (E)   Setbacks.
      (1)   Front yard setback requirements in the RL and RE zones shall be as
follows:
 
LOT LINE BOUNDED BY BUILDING TYPE     REQUIRED SETBACK
Front    A street   Main or accessory 25'
 
         (a)   Average setback. Where residences or buildings on the same side
of the street as the subject property are developed with front yard setbacks
greater than required in the zone, the average setback shall be required. The
average setback shall be determined using structures on the same side of the
street in the same block, not to exceed 400 feet on either side of the subject
property. The largest and smallest setback will be excluded in determining the
average.
         (b)   Encroachments. Porches, platforms, and landing places not
extending above the level of the first floor may encroach up to seven feet into
the required setback. Architectural elements, such as oriel, cornices, eaves,
or sills may encroach up to two feet.
         (c)   Flag lots. The front yard setback on a flag lot shall be
measured from the closest property line, parallel to and not adjacent to the
street. However, if a flag lot has a street frontage of 50 feet or greater, the
front setback may be taken from the front property line if the house is built
in the narrow portion of the lot. When a house on a flag lot is oriented in a
direction other than towards the street, the Development Review Committee shall
determine from where the front yard setback is measured.
      (2)   Side yard setback requirements in the RL and RE zones shall be as
follows:
 
LOT LINE BOUNDED BY              BUILDING TYPE       REQUIRED SETBACK

         (a)   Encroachments. Chimneys having a maximum parallel linear
dimension of eight feet may project two feet into the required setback.
Chimneys extending past the second floor may project into the side yard the
same amount as on the first floor. Eaves may project two feet into the required
setback.
         (b)   Second story setback. The required second story setback shall be
12 feet or the required first floor setback, whichever is greater. For
structures over 27 feet in height, the second story must be set back an
additional two feet for every additional one foot in height.
         (c)   Decks and balconies.  Decks one foot or more above the existing
grade and balconies shall maintain the same setback as main buildings.
         (d)   Accessory structures located less than 80 feet from the front
line must be set back the same distance from property line as a main structure.
         (e)   On corner lots with garages opening onto the street, the garage
must be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the side property line adjacent to
the street.
         (f)   Accessory structures with a plate height exceeding nine feet
and/or a ridge height exceeding 14 feet and two-story accessory structures
shall maintain the same setback as the main building.

First story  6'
Second story 20'
 
      (2)   These building separation requirements apply equally to separate
buildings that share a common roof.
   (H)   Hillside Development permit required. In addition to the requirements
of this chapter, where development proposals require grading of the lot with
five feet or more of cut, five feet or more of fill, or a retaining wall of six
feet in height or higher, approval of a Hillside Development permit is required
for the following:

         (a)   Average setback. Where residences or buildings on the same side
of the street as the subject property are developed with front yard setbacks
greater than required in the zone, the average setback shall be required. The
average setback shall be determined using structures on the same side of the
street in the same block, not to exceed 400 feet on either side of the subject
property. The largest and smallest setback will be excluded in determining the
average.
         (b)   Encroachments. Porches, platforms, and landing places not
extending above the level of the first floor may encroach up to seven feet into
the required setback. Architectural elements such as oriel, cornices, eaves, or
sills may project up to two feet into the required setback.
         (c)   Flag lots. The front yard setback on a flag lot shall be
measured from the closest property line, parallel to and not adjacent to the
street. However, if a flag lot has a street frontage of 50 feet or greater, the
front setback may be taken from the front property line if the house is built
in the narrow portion of the lot. When a house on a flag lot is oriented in a
direction other than towards the street, the Development Review Committee shall
determine from where the front yard setback is measured.
      (2)   Side yard setback requirements in the RM, RM/PUD, RM/RH, and RH

         (a)   Masonry walls;
         (b)   Wooden fencing, if of adequate aesthetic and structural quality
and durability;
         (c)   Wrought-iron fencing: Spacing between vertical bars on all

   (C)   Minimized visible garage. On blocks where the predominant pattern of
the placement of garages is detached at the rear of the property or otherwise
minimally visible from the street, the provisions for a minimized visible
garage shall apply when a new garage is proposed.
      (1)   Applicability.  The predominant pattern shall be based on a review
of properties located on the same side of the street in the same block, no less
than 400 feet on either side of the subject property. Minimized visible garage
requirements shall be required of new development when at least 50% of those
properties have minimally visible garages. For purposes of determining this
requirement, minimally visible garage shall mean a property where the garage is
in the rear yard. In cases where the predominant pattern should be determined
by other means, based on the subject property's location, topography and
proximity to corners, the director shall decide on the averaging method.
      (2)   Requirements. When the predominant pattern requires a minimized
visible garage. The following regulations shall apply:

are otherwise not visible from the street shall be allowed to add an additional
400 square feet added to the maximum size of the primary structure. This
provision only applies to properties developed with single family dwellings.
      (3)   Properties developed with more than one dwelling unit, the primary
structure shall be the dwelling closest to the street.
      (4)   Exemptions.  Properties not covered by the minimized visible garage
placement requirement shall be reviewed pursuant the applicable regulations of
the zoning district where the property is located in addition to the
neighborhood compatibility design review process.
   (D)   Irregularly shaped lots. For lots that are not generally rectangular
in shape and if there is uncertainty on the method for determining lot
orientation, lot depth and/or lot width, the committee shall have the power to
determine the appropriate method. Existing development on the property and in
the neighborhood shall be considered in making this determination. Once a
determination is made and the resulting development is completed, a subsequent
determination shall not be made to permit additional improvements that would
make the previous improvements nonconforming.
   (E)   Lot consolidation. Consolidation or merger of lots in any residential
zone requires a conditional use permit. In addition to the findings specified
in §17.52.200, the Commission must also find that the proposed consolidation
will not result in the demolition of a residential structure built prior to
January 1, 1940 with architectural or known historic value.

hedges, shrubs, ground signs or other physical obstruction higher than three
feet above grade shall be located in the triangular area defined by the
intersections diagramed on the following pages (the diagrams are not to scale).

§ 17.16.040 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS FOR THE SOUTH MYRTLE AVENUE CORRIDOR.
   (A)   Purpose. The provisions in this section are intended to provide
development policies and standards for properties located within South Myrtle
Avenue Corridor.
   (B)   Area defined. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the
regulations set forth in this section shall apply to all properties depicted in
Figure 1 of the City of Monrovia General Plan Land Use Element, approved by the
City Council on January 15, 2008 (Resolution No. 2008-03), and on file in the
Office of the City Clerk, and titled “Figure 1 - South Myrtle Avenue Corridor
Planning Area.” Said Figure 1 is incorporated herein by this reference as
though set forth in full.
   (C)   Old Town Extension. For areas delineated as Old Town Extension
depicted in Figure 1 of the City of Monrovia General Plan Land Use Element,
approved by the City Council on January 15, 2008 (Resolution No. 2008-03), and
on file in the Office of the City Clerk, and titled “Figure 1 - South Myrtle
Avenue Corridor Planning Area,” the following development standards are created
to ensure new development in the Old Town Extension Planning Area is compatible
and complementary with the historic downtown of Monrovia. One of the following
two options shall apply:
      (1)   Option to use underlying zone. The provisions of this chapter shall
not apply to parcels that have been or are proposed to be developed entirely
under the underlying zone, provided that all requirements of the underlying
zone are met by the project except as specifically approved otherwise by
variance or other official action by the city.
      (2)   Option to use Specific Plan Overlay Zone. The provisions of this
chapter shall apply to parcels that are proposed to be developed entirely under
the Specific Plan Overlay Zone.
         (a)   Specific Plan required. For the parcels that are proposed to be
developed, a specific plan and a zone change to “SP” is required in order to
use this option. The property owner shall apply for a specific plan and zone
change, in accordance with the procedure set forth in
Chapter 17.54 and
§ 17.52.050 of the Monrovia Municipal Code.
         (b)   Uses. The Specific Plan Overlay Zone allows a mix of residential
and commercial uses to be built as integrated, cohesive developments with
approval of a Specific Plan. Development proposals will be reviewed to ensure
integration with established uses and development within that block, and
compatibility with adjacent lower-scale residential neighborhoods. All
buildings with frontage on Myrtle Avenue shall exclusively have ground-floor
commercial uses. Permitted commercial uses will be identified in each Specific
Plan. Commercial or residential uses are permitted on the floors above.
Development without Myrtle Avenue frontage may be exclusively residential.
         (c)   Minimum development size. To be eligible for the Specific Plan
Overlay Zone a Specific Plan area shall be a minimum area of two acres.
         (d)   Development density. A maximum residential density of 54 units
to the acre is permitted. For non-residential uses the maximum floor area ratio
shall not exceed 2 to 1 (excluding parking structures).

§ 17.16.050 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS FOR THE WEST HUNTINGTON DRIVE CORRIDOR.
   (A)   Purpose. The provisions in this section are intended to provide
development policies and standards for properties located within West
Huntington Drive Corridor that have the Retail Corridor Commercial (RCC) and
the Retail Corridor Mixed Use (RCM) zoning designation.
   (B)   Applicable regulations. The following provisions are intended to
supplement the development standards outlined in this chapter.
      (1)   Retail Corridor Commercial (RCC) Zone. The provisions of this
section shall apply to parcels that are zoned with the Retail Corridor
Commercial zoning designation.
         (a)   Development density. The maximum intensity of development with
surface parking is a floor-area ratio (FAR) of 2.0. New developments are
encouraged to provide parking away from the street frontage (i.e., structured,
subterranean, behind street-facing retail stores). Retail Corridor Commercial
land use classification provides a floor area ratio (FAR) bonus for the removal
of surface parking lots and relocation to a subterranean parking structure. The
maximum intensity of development with subterranean and/or structured parking is
a floor-area ratio (FAR) of 3.0.
         (b)   Building height. Where adjacent to single-family residential
development, building and site design must be sensitive to these neighborhoods,
avoiding multi-story buildings and appropriately locating loading docks and
other service areas away from these areas.
         (c)   Building setbacks. Buildings shall be setback ten feet from the
front property line to provide landscaping and hardscape entrances. The ten-
foot setback can be reduced to less than ten feet subject to approval by the
Development Review Committee.
         (d)   Building orientation and use. Developments must incorporate
ground-level retail uses along Huntington Drive and pedestrian connections
throughout. Buildings shall be built facing Huntington Drive.
      (2)   Retail Corridor Mixed Use (RCM) Commercial Zone. The provisions of
this section shall apply to parcels that are zoned with the Retail Corridor
Mixed Use zoning designation.
         (a)   Development density. The maximum intensity of development with
surface parking is a floor-area ratio (FAR) of 2.0. New developments are
encouraged to provide parking away from the street frontage (i.e., structured,
subterranean, behind street-facing retail stores). This designation also
permits residential developments at a maximum density of 54 dwelling units to
the acre.
         (b)   Building orientation and use. The scale and character of new
development is intended to support and reinforce the image of West Huntington
Drive as a retail corridor. Buildings shall be oriented to streets and provide
pedestrian amenities. Developments should emphasize ground-level retail uses
along Huntington Drive and pedestrian connections throughout. Buildings should
be built to face on Huntington Drive if feasible. Residential uses are not
permitted along the parcels fronting Huntington Drive.
         (c)   Minor deviations from lot size and dimension requirements. New
parcels with minor deviations pertaining to the minimum lot size and/or
dimension development standards may be permitted, provided that the associated
project supports the intent of the RCM Zone and the planning objectives
articulated in the Monrovia Municipal Code and Monrovia General Plan Land Use
Element.
         (d)   Nonconforming uses. Existing structures containing uses that
become nonconforming upon the adoption of these regulations may be expanded
subject to the approval of a conditional use permit if the Commission can
determine that the proposal is consistent with the goals and objectives
outlined in the West Huntington Drive Corridor Land Use Plan contained in the
City of Monrovia General Plan Land Use Element, approved by the City Council on
January 15, 2008 (Resolution No. 2008-01), and on file in the Office of the
City Clerk.

§ 17.20.040 OAK TREE PRESERVATION.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is the preservation of healthy
oak trees which are necessary to preserve the present scenic beauty and
heritage of Monrovia, maintain property values and promote conservation of
natural resources. It is the intent of this chapter to establish regulations
for the removal and pruning of oak trees within the city in order to retain as
many trees as possible consistent with the purpose hereof and the reasonable
economic enjoyment of private property.
      (1)   Oak trees subject to this section. Any oak tree ten inches in
diameter or more measured at two feet above the level ground is subject to this
section. For the purpose of this chapter, OAK TREES mean the native California
Live Oak (Quercus Agrifolia) and or any other trees of the oak family.
      (2)   Properties subject to this section.
         (a)   Single-family zoned properties with oak trees in the front yard
or street-facing side yard.
         (b)   In the multiple-family, commercial or industrial zones (RM, RM/
PUD, RH, RM/RH, NC, HCD, CD/O, C/RS, O/RD/LM, BE, M, P/QP and PD) all oak
trees. Exception: Single-family developed properties where no additional
development is proposed shall be subject to division (A)(2)(a) above.
         (c)   All oak trees on vacant lots.
         (d)   All oak trees indicated on an oak tree preservation plan.
      (3)   Conditions requiring a permit. An oak tree preservation permit is
required for any of the following:
         (a)   If an oak tree is to be cut to the ground, completely extracted,
or to be killed or removed, by any other means; or
         (b)   If an oak tree is to be pruned so that more than one-third of
the crown, existing foliage, or root system of the tree is removed; or
         (c)   If irrigation is to be installed or grading (cutting/or filling)
is to take place within the drip line of an oak tree.
      (4)   Permit process.
         (a)   At the time of application for an oak tree preservation permit,
all applicants shall submit a tree location map drawn to scale (scale shall not
be more than one inch equals 20 feet) locating existing oak trees on the
project site with a trunk diameter of ten inches or greater. This map shall
identify the approximate trunk diameter, base elevation, height, and condition
of each oak tree.
         (b)   An oak tree preservation permit will be filed and a decision by
the Development Review Committee shall be rendered for each permit application.
The determination of the Development Review Committee will be based upon the
following criteria:
            1.   The condition of the tree with respect to disease, danger of
falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures, and interference with
utility service.
            2.   The necessity to remove the tree for compelling economic
necessity to construct proposed structural improvements, or for the purpose of
relandscaping with plant material more suitable to the immediate environment.
            3.   Good forestry practice, such as in the thinning of growth
where necessary or desirable to promote the healthy growth of the tree.
            4.   The topography of the land and the effect of tree removal on
erosion, soil retention or surface water flow shall be taken into account and
balanced with all other considerations affecting decision upon the permit.
            5.   The number of oak trees or other trees existing in the
neighborhood on improved property. The Development Review Committee shall be
guided by the standards established in the neighborhood and the effect of tree
removal upon property values in the area.
      (5)   Appeal process. Except in the event of a perceived emergency, the
issuance of an oak tree preservation permit may be appealed to the Planning
Commission within ten days of the Development Review Committee's decision.
      (6)   Exceptions. In case of emergency when a tree is hazardous or
dangerous to life or property, it may be removed by order of any member of the
Police Department, Fire Department, or Community Services Department (Parks and
Tree Division); provided, further, that any franchised public utility or
representative of the city may remove trees which interfere with the safe and
efficient operation of the public service for which they are responsible.
      (7)   Variances.  Standards may be deviated from (i.e., yard sizes,
building separations, setbacks) if the Planning Commission determines that the
preservation and retention of the oak tree outweighs the disadvantages
associated with any variance granted to save it.
      (8)   Penalty. Violations of this section by a single-family homeowner
shall be punishable as an infraction. Persons with violations on lots developed
with other than single-family homes shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.
Violators may also be required to replace the tree(s) with a tree of comparable
size, type, and condition as determined by the Development Review Committee.
      (9)   Protection requirement for oak trees during construction. The
following conditions must be observed during construction, development, or
maintenance of any site:
         (a)   Specified oak trees are to have a protective fence, approved by
the Development Review Committee, surrounding the base out at least two-thirds
of the total drip line during construction. Permanent decorative fencing may be
required by the Development Review Committee as one of the conditions of
approval for the project.
         (b)   Grading (cutting and/or filling) within the drip line of trees
shall be approved by the Development Review Committee.
         (c)   Trees that have been damaged by construction shall be repaired
in accordance with accepted arboriculture methods by a tree specialist.
         (d)   Oil, gas, chemicals, or other construction materials shall not
be stored in the drip line of any trees.
         (e)   Drains shall be installed according to expert advice whenever
soil fill is placed around trees.
         (f)   Signs, wires, or any type of obstruction shall not be attached
to trees.
         (g)   The required landscape and irrigation plan shall be tailored per
the needs of the retained tree as specified by a tree specialist. The
irrigation system must be on a separate clock.

on the CMP network. Impacts and recommended mitigation measures identified by
the transit operator shall be evaluated in the draft environmental impact
report prepared for the project. Related mitigation measures adopted shall be
monitored through the mitigation monitoring requirements of CEQA. Phased
development projects, development projects subject to a development agreement,
or development projects requiring subsequent approvals, need not repeat this
process as long as no significant changes are made to the project. It shall
remain the discretion of the lead agency to determine when a project is
substantially the same and therefore covered by a previously certified EIR.

§ 17.28.010 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Signs should advertise a place of business or provide information and
shall be architecturally attractive and contribute to the character of the
area.
   (B)   The intent of these sign regulations is to give businesses varying
opportunities for promotion and visibility as well as establish standards by
which signage will be moderate, attractive and uniform in intensity. The
standards allow enough variation to permit businesses to have creative signs.
Signs are to be controlled so as to minimize their tendency to compete
excessively with each other and with the desired character of the area. Through
reasonably applied design criteria, signs are to be prevented from distracting
and dominating the setting via their height, shape, size, number, color,
lighting, and movement.
   (C)   Sign standards are to assure the applicant that all other
establishments are similarly restricted, and their establishment is protected
against overpowering advertising structures from competitors and/or adjacent
properties in the area.
   (D)   Review of signs on an administrative committee level is an integral
part of the sign standards and process and should seek to create a vital yet
fair atmosphere for sign promotion and visibility while upholding the
overriding standard of moderation. This review is conducted by the Development
Review Committee as outlined in §§
2.56.030,
17.52.030 and
17.52.050.

support and may be easily moved or relocated. A SIDEWALK WALL SIGN is a sign
that is attached to the wall of a building that is at eye level to pedestrians.
         (a)   A freestanding sidewalk sign, if permitted, shall be located
within two and one-half feet of the building face provided that ADA clearance
is maintained. The Development Review Committee may allow a freestanding
sidewalk sign to be further from a building face if special conditions or
constraints exist.

         (h)   In Old Town, the Development Review Committee may approve
sidewalk signs for businesses that are not eating establishments, bakeries,
florists, and the like, so long as the sidewalk signs are integrated with the
theme of the business and compatible with the historical character of Old Town.
In considering this type of sign, the Development Review Committee may impose
restrictions on materials, color, style, quality and the like to ensure
compatibility with the historical character of the downtown area.
         (i)   In addition to the sidewalk signs described above, in Old Town,
one temporary sidewalk display sign no bigger than four feet in height or three
feet in width, to promote special sales and openings shall be allowed provided
that any such sign shall not be displayed for more than 15 days at one time and
shall not exceed four times in a 12-month period.
         (j)   For all sidewalk signs, insurance shall be required naming the
city as an additional insured. The amount of insurance, type of coverage and

the city’s Risk Manager. Before placing a sidewalk sign, in addition to any
approvals required by this chapter, a city encroachment permit shall be
obtained from the Department of Public Works.

         (a)   One pole sign that integrates both the service station emblem or
trademark and the State of California mandatory price sign on the same pole in
a non-contiguous manner shall be allowed at any one service station. Said sign
shall be located in a landscaped area the size of which shall be equivalent to
the total sign area of both emblem and price signs, but in no case shall have a
dimension of less than five feet, and shall not project into a public way.
         (b)   The maximum area of any face of the emblem or trademark section
shall be 40 square feet. The maximum area of the price section, which shall not
be contiguous with the emblem section, shall be 25 square feet. No one face

price sign no larger than the emblem, and shall not exceed six feet in overall
vertical height (including base). The base shall not exceed two feet in height,
excluding architectural treatments that do not raise the height.
         (c)   The State of California mandatory fuel price sign that is part
of a service station monument sign may be an electronic fuel price sign. An
electronic fuel price sign means a sign that allows the price to be changed
remotely through electronic means and utilizes an electronic display to display
the price as digits. The area of the electronic display shall be included in
calculating the total permitted sign area. The area of the electronic display
may not exceed 50% of the total sign area.
            1.   An electronic fuel price sign shall contain only static price
displays, and shall not have movement, or the appearance or optical illusion of
movement, and shall not flash, scintillate, or vary the light intensity.
            2.   An electronic fuel price sign shall be illuminated no greater
than the minimum level required to ensure nighttime readability from a distance
of 300 feet. The illumination from an electronic fuel price sign shall not
impair the vision of travelers on adjacent right-of-ways. The illumination
shall be considered vision impairing when its brilliance exceeds the values set
forth in § 21466.5 of the California Vehicle Code. An electronic fuel price
sign shall not cause beams or rays of light to be directed at nearby
properties, including without limitation nearby right-of-ways, if the light is
of an intensity or brilliance as to cause glare, and shall be in compliance
with §
17.32.090. An electronic fuel price sign shall not be so illuminated that it
interferes with the effectiveness of or obscures any official traffic sign,
device, or signal.
            3.   Any structures, visible devices, cages or shielding related to
or attached to an electronic fuel price sign are prohibited, unless reviewed
and approved by the Development Review Committee prior to installation.
            4.   The owner of an electronic fuel price sign shall promptly turn
off the sign in the event of a malfunction that violates any provision of the
Monrovia Municipal Code, or creates a public health or safety hazard. The sign
shall remain off until the malfunction is remedied and the electronic sign is
working in compliance with the Monrovia Municipal Code. The owner of an
electronic price sign shall provide the city with contact information,
including a telephone number, for a person who is available at all times to
accept a report from the city that the message board is malfunctioning.
            5.   The Development Review Committee shall make the following
findings before approving an electronic fuel price sign:
               a.   The electronic fuel price sign will not detract from the
visibility of other signs; and
               b.   The electronic fuel sign and the conditions under which it
will be operated will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or
welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

first.
         (b)   A future tenant identification sign shall not exceed 24 square
feet in area.
      (4)   Real estate signs.

§ 17.28.110 NONRESIDENTIAL SIGNS—SIGN QUALITY FOR NONRESIDENTIAL USES.
   The goal of design for signs city-wide is to keep moderate, attractive and
compatible styling so as not to cause erratic or disturbing distractions from
the architectural character of nearby businesses. The choice of materials is
left to the discretion of the applicant(s) for each shopping center or for each
individual business subject to the approval of the Development Review
Committee. The Development Review Committee may, after careful review,
determine that any combination of materials defined in divisions (A) or (B) of
this section may or may not meet the intent and purpose of this chapter. The
Development Review Committee may approve, conditionally approve or deny any
sign quality or material based on compatibility with the intent and purpose of
this chapter.
   (A)   The following materials are recommended and desirable for establishing
a sign plan for an individual business or a comprehensive sign plan for a
shopping center:
      (1)   Sign face supports and standards made of resawn or rough sawn wood
and/or wrought iron with painted backgrounds and lettering;
      (2)   Sign face, supports and standards made of smooth wood trimmed with
painted backgrounds and lettering;
      (3)   Use of individual styrene letters on the face of the building;
      (4)   Use of wood cutouts or wrought iron silhouettes further identifying
the business on any of the above;
      (5)   Sandblasted redwood.
   (B)   The following materials and details are less desirable; however, they
may be approved by the Development Review Committee following submittal of
design specifications and materials. Design and materials must be compatible
with the intent and purpose of this chapter:
      (1)   Contemporary finish materials such as porcelain, enamel, aluminum
and steel;
      (2)   Imitation wood or imitation marble;
      (3)   Bright gloss enamel, or reflecting surfaces;
      (4)   Exposed neon tube graphics.
   (C)   The following materials and details are not acceptable:
      (1)   (Reserved)

§ 17.28.120 NONRESIDENTIAL SIGNS—GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL SIGNS.
   (A)   Structures supporting freestanding signs shall be designed in such a
manner so as to reflect as an integral part of the design of the building (i.e.
brick or stucco pilasters).
   (B)   All multiple tenant complexes (shopping centers and the like) shall
have approval of a comprehensive sign plan prior to any individual sign
approvals. The intent and purpose of a comprehensive sign plan is to assure
that the signage of a center will appear as an integral part of a center and to
encourage compatibility with the center in an orderly, efficient and attractive
manner.
   (C)   Signs visible from the exterior of any building may be indirectly
lighted or shadow-lighted so that the immediate source of the illumination is
not visible.
   (D)   Signs (except Old Town) may be interior lighted, but only so that the
lettering and any graphic is illuminated and all other portions are opaque; but
also no sign or other contrivance shall be constructed so as to rotate, gyrate,
blink or move in any animated fashion.
   (E)   Signs shall be restricted to advertising only the person, firm,
company or corporation operating the use conducted on the site.
   (F)   A wall sign with the individual letters applied shall be measured by a
rectangle around the outside of the lettering and/or the pictorial symbol and
calculating the area enclosed by such line.
   (G)   All signs attached to a building shall be surface-mounted.
   (H)   No roof sign of any kind shall be permitted.
   (I)   The sign shall in no way endanger the health and safety of the public
by causing distractions to operators of motor vehicles on the streets and/or
highways.
   (J)   All lighting shall be located and of such color that there will be no
confusion with public signs or signals regulating the flow of vehicular
traffic.
   (K)   Using the minor exception procedure as outlined in
Chapter 17.52, the Development Review Committee shall have authority to approve
a larger sign than is provided for in this chapter if a finding is made that
the larger sign is in architectural harmony with the premises upon which it is
to be located and is compatible with the intent and purpose of this chapter.

of this section. Prior to issuing any necessary permits for an electronic
message board, the applicant shall submit to the city written verification from
the manufacturer that the electronic message is so designed and equipped.
      (8)   The owner of an electronic message board shall provide the city
with contact information for a person who is available to turn off the
electronic message board promptly after a malfunction.
      (9)   Any structures, visible devices, cages, or shielding related to or
attached to an electronic message board are prohibited unless reviewed and
approved by the Development Review Committee prior to installation.
      (10)   An electronic message board located on a lot adjacent to a
residential unit(s) or lot(s) zoned for residential use shall be turned off
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

message board, the permit may be reviewed and additional conditions and
limitations may be imposed by the Development Review Committee, including
without limitation, lighting, illumination, hours of operation or intensity of
the electronic message board, if complaints, subject to verification by staff,
are received from the public.

§ 17.40.020 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The City Council of the City of Monrovia has determined the following to be
the intent and purpose of historic preservation in the City of Monrovia:
   (A)   That the character, history and neighborhood identity of the city are
reflected in and are reflections of its cultural, physical, and architectural
heritage.
   (B)   That these historical and cultural foundations should be preserved as
living parts of community life and development to build an understanding of the
city's past so that future generations may have a genuine opportunity to

§ 17.40.100 ECONOMIC HARDSHIP—HISTORIC LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   The Commission shall comply with the certificate of appropriateness
procedure and required findings as outlined in this section.
   (A)   The owner of an Historic Landmark or contributor in an Historic
District applying for a certificate of appropriateness may request that an
alteration be conducted even though it does not meet the findings for such
certificate if that owner can substantiate the suffering of an economic
hardship.

testimony, at the owners' expense, and/or require that the owner submit any or
all of the following information prior to making a determination on the
application:
      (1)   Cost estimates of the proposed alteration and an estimate of the
additional cost(s) that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of
the Commission.

whether the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the owners.

support of the request and shall include a hardship relief plan to relieve,
where possible, economic hardship. This plan may include recommendation such as
property tax relief, loans or grants, acquisition of property, use of the State
Historic Building Code, changes in applicable zoning regulations, and
redevelopment funds.
   (D)   The Commission shall review all the evidence and information required
of an applicant and the staff hardship relief plan and make a determination
within 90 days of receipt of the application as to whether the denial of the
certificate of appropriateness has deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the
property of all reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property.
   (E)   If the applicant presents facts and clear evidence demonstrating to
the Commission that failure to approve the application for a certificate of
appropriateness will cause an immediate hardship because of conditions peculiar
to the particular structure or other feature involved, and that no plan
implementable by the city can relieve the hardship to a sufficient extent, and
the damage to the owner of the property is unreasonable in comparison to the
benefit conferred to the community, the Commission may recommend to the City
Council to approve or conditionally approve such certificate. The final
decision shall be made by the City Council.
   (F)   (1)   Issuance of such a certificate of appropriateness shall be
accompanied by a written determination, based on the following findings:
         (a)   Denial of the application would diminish the value of the
subject property so as to leave substantially no value;
         (b)   Sale or rental of the property is impractical, when compared to
the cost of holding such property for uses permitted in this zone;
         (c)   An adaptive reuse study and hardship relief plan have been
conducted and found that utilization of the property and any economic return
therefrom is not reasonable or feasible;
         (d)   Rental at a reasonable rate of return is not feasible;
         (e)   Denial of the certificate of appropriateness would damage the
owner of the property unreasonably in comparison to the benefit conferred on
the community;
         (f)   All means involving city sponsored incentives, have been
explored to relieve possible economic disincentives;
         (g)   The economic hardship under review is strictly related to any
such hardship created or related directly to the property itself and that in
considering the certificate of appropriateness with the request under economic
hardship, personal, family, or business difficulties, loss of prospective
profits, poor quality maintenance and neighboring violations were not
considered justifiable hardships; or
         (h)   In the case of a proposed demolition, the designated landmark
cannot be remodeled or rehabilitated in a manner which would allow a reasonable
use of or return from the property to the property owner.
      (2)   If the Commission finds otherwise it shall issue a recommendation
to the City Council for denial of the request. If the City Council concurs it
shall deny the application for a certificate of appropriateness and economic
hardship dispensation and notify the applicant by mail of the final denial.
   (G)   If approval of a certificate of appropriateness and economic hardship
dispensation will result in the demolition of a nominated or designated
cultural resource, the applicant shall be required to provide documentation of
the resource proposed for demolition to the standards of the Historic American
Building Survey. Such documentation may include photographs, floor plans,
measured drawings, archeological survey, or other documentation stipulated by
the Commission.

         (c)   Within 1,000 feet of any public or private school, park,
playground, public building, church, any noncommercial establishment operated
by a bona fide religious organization.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, measurements shall be made in a
straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the
nearest property line of the property where an adult business is to be
conducted to the nearest property line of the premise of any facility, use or
business referenced in division (C)(1) of this section.
      (3)   The establishment of an adult business shall include the opening of
such a business as a new business, the relocation of such business, or the
conversion of an existing business location to any adult business use.
   (D)   Development and performance standards.
      (1)   Adult businesses shall comply with the following development and
performance standards:
         (a)   Advertisements, displays or other promotional materials
depicting or describing nude or semi- nude persons, as defined in division (B)

for the adult business shall be developed such that they are directly visible
from the public right-of-way unless the access thereto is physically restricted
to employees only.
         (e)   No loudspeakers or sound equipment shall be used by an adult
business for the amplification of sound to a level discernible by the public
beyond the walls of the building in which the adult business is conducted.
   (E)   Required conditional use permit findings.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall approve a conditional use permit for
an adult business if the Commission is able to make affirmative findings based
on all of the following criteria:
         (a)   The proposed use and development are consistent with the General
Plan and either comply with or are concurrently conditioned to comply with the
location standards and development and performance set forth in this section;
         (b)   The proposed site is adequate in size, shape and topography to
accommodate the proposed use, the amount of vehicular parking spaces, and other
improvements required by this code;
         (c)   The proposed site has vehicular and pedestrian access to an
improved roadway and the proposed use will not result in an unmitigated
reduction in the level of service standard of traffic capacity on adjacent
roadways; and

section, it shall be submitted to the Development Review Committee for review
and approval prior to the issuance of a building permit. In reviewing the
proposed plan, the Development Review Committee shall be guided by the
following principles:
      (1)   Installation of the satellite receiving antennae, where feasible,
should be located in the interior of a building, within a side or rear yard, on
a roof if within a roof well or other location screened by a parapet wall, or
other unobtrusive location on the property so as to reduce visual impact;
      (2)   The installation of all accessory equipment should be adjacent to
the main unit;

designed with architectural features and/or landscaping that harmonize with the
elements and characteristics of the property;
      (4)   All ground-mounted satellite receiving antennae should be placed
adjacent to main or accessory structures or other appropriate solid background
in order to minimize visual impacts;
      (5)   All ground-mounted satellite receiving antennae in residential
zones, with the exception of churches, schools and other quasi-public
institutions, shall not exceed 15 feet in height; and

commercial, planned development, and public/quasi-public zones shall not exceed
the height of 20 feet above grade level.

Planning Commission for its consideration and decision. The Development Review
Committee or the Planning Commission, as the case may be, shall approve the
precise plan of design if it is found that the functional arrangement and
general appearance of the installation conform to the intent and requirements
of this section. Any decision or condition imposed shall not be applied in such
a manner as to preclude reasonable signal reception or to impose costs on the
applicant that are excessive in light of the purchase and installation cost of
the satellite receiving antennae. The plan as submitted may be disapproved,
conditionally approved or modified if it is found that the proposed design:
      (1)   Would substantially interfere with the quiet use and enjoyment of
surrounding or adjacent properties;
      (2)   Would be substantially and materially incompatible with the natural
environment and beauty of surrounding property;
      (3)   Would deter an orderly and attractive development of the community
in general, and surrounding properties in particular;
      (4)   Would otherwise adversely affect the public peace, safety or
general economic welfare; or
      (5)   Would not materially comply with the provisions of this section.
   (E)   No person shall install, either as owner or agent, or employee of an
owner, or as an independent contractor of an owner, or otherwise, any satellite
receiving antennae, any addition thereto or any modification thereof, without
complying with the provisions of this section.

thresholds for determining if a modification substantially changes the physical
dimensions of a wireless tower or base station based on the type and location.
      (1)   For towers located outside the public right-of-way, a SUBSTANTIAL
CHANGE occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed modification increases the overall height of the
tower by more than 10% or the height of one additional antenna array with
separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet (whichever
is greater); or
         (b)   The proposed modification involves adding an appurtenance to the
body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than 20
feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the
appurtenance (whichever is greater); or
         (c)   The proposed modification involves the installation of more than
the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not
to exceed four cabinets; or
         (d)   The proposed modification entails any excavation or deployment
of transmission equipment outside the current site by more than 30 feet in any
direction; the site boundary from which the 30 feet is measured excludes any
access or utility easements currently related to the site.
      (2)   For all base stations located outside the public right-of-way, a
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed modification increases the overall height more than
10% or ten feet (whichever is greater); or
         (b)   The proposed modification involves adding an appurtenance to the
body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the base station by
more than six feet; or
         (c)   The proposed modification involves the installation of any new
ground-mounted equipment cabinets when there are no pre-existing ground-mounted
equipment cabinets associated with the structure; or involves the installation
of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are more than 10% larger in
height or overall volume than any other existing ground-mounted equipment
cabinets associated with the structure; or
         (d)   The proposed modification involves excavation or deployment
outside the current site.
      (3)   In addition, for all towers and base stations located outside of
the public right-of-way, a SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed modification would defeat the existing concealment
elements of the eligible support structure (wireless tower or base station) as
reasonably determined by the Director; or
         (b)   The proposed modification does not comply with conditions of
approval associated with the construction or modification of the eligible
support structure or base station equipment; provided, however, that the
collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to
height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the
thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.
      (4)   For purposes of this definition, changes in height shall be
measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or
will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings’ rooftops; in other
circumstances, changes in height shall be measured from the dimensions of the
tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any
modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act.

(Ord. 2021-10 § 6 (part), 2021)
§ 17.46.060 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   (A)   Purpose. This section sets forth the application submittal
requirements for all permits required by this chapter. These requirements may
be augmented by a resolution adopted by the City Council. The purpose of this
section is, in part, to ensure that this chapter is implemented to the full
extent permitted by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 6409(a), the
Declaratory Ruling and Third Report and Order adopted by the FCC entitled In
the Matter of Accelerating Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers
to Infrastructure Investment, 83 FR 51867-01 (published in the Federal Register
on October 15, 2018) [hereinafter “Report and Order”], the final rule adopted
by the FCC entitled Accelerating Wireless and Wireline Deployment by
Streamlining Local Approval of Wireless Infrastructure Modifications, 85 FR
78005-01 (published in Federal Register on December 3, 2020); and all other
federal regulations, FCC rulings and orders, and state law, regulations and
orders applicable to the installation, modification and/or collocation of
wireless telecommunications facilities.
   (B)   Voluntary pre-submittal conferences. The city strongly encourages, but
does not require, applicants to schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference
with the Director for all proposed wireless telecommunications facilities and
wireless telecommunications collocation facilities projects. This voluntary
pre-submittal conference is not part of the application process, and does not
cause the shot clock to begin, and is intended to facilitate and streamline the
review process through informal discussion and consultation that includes,
without limitation, the appropriate project classification, potential
eligibility as a permitted or conditionally permitted use, permit requirements
and review process for a potential facility; any latent issues in connection
with a potential project, including compliance with generally applicable rules
for public health and safety; potential concealment issues or concerns (if
applicable); coordination with other city departments responsible for
application review; and application completeness issues. To mitigate
unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged
(but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that
city staff may provide informal feedback and guidance about whether such
applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Director
shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment
within five working days after receiving a written request for a voluntary pre-
submittal conference.
   (C)   Shot clock; timeline for review and action. In accordance with federal
and/or state law, the timeline for review of and action on a wireless
telecommunications facility application or wireless telecommunications
collocation application shall begin to run when the application is submitted in
writing to the Department but may be reset or tolled depending on the type of
application upon the city’s issuance of a notice of incomplete application to
the applicant pursuant to division (D) of this section, or by mutual agreement.
Applications shall be processed in conformance with the time periods and
procedures established by applicable state and federal law, and FCC regulations
and orders. The following timing requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Small wireless facility.
         (a)   Sixty days. For an application to collocate a small wireless
facility using an existing structure, the city will act upon the application
within 60 days from the Department’s receipt of the written application packet,
unless the time period is reset or tolled pursuant to §
17.46.060(D)(1)(a) or (D)(1)(b) or by mutual written agreement.
      (b)   Ninety days. For an application to collocate a small wireless
facility using a new structure, the city will act upon the application within
90 days from the Department’s receipt of the written application packet, unless
the time period is reset or tolled pursuant to §
17.46.060(D)(1)(a) or (D)(1)(b), or by mutual written agreement.
   (2)   Eligible facilities request.
      (a)   Sixty days. For an application for a modification of an existing
wireless telecommunications facility that qualifies as an eligible facility
defined in Section 6409(a), as codified in §
17.46.020 of this chapter, the city will act upon the application within 60
days from the Department’s receipt of the written application packet, unless
the time period is tolled pursuant to §
17.46.060(D)(2)(a) or (D)(2)(b), or re-set or tolled by mutual written
agreement.
   (3)   Major wireless telecommunications facilities.
      (a)   One hundred fifty days. For an application for a new major wireless
telecommunications facility that is not for collocation, the city will act upon
the application within 150 days from the Department’s receipt of the written
application packet, unless the time period is tolled pursuant to §
17.46.060(D)(3)(a) or (D)(3)(b), or re-set or tolled by mutual written
agreement.
      (b)   Ninety days. For an application for a major wireless
telecommunications collocation facility on an existing structure, the city will
act upon the application within 90 days from the Department’s receipt of the
written application packet, unless the time period is tolled pursuant to §
17.46.060(D)(3)(a) or (D)(3)(b), or reset or tolled by mutual written
agreement.
   (D)   Resetting or tolling of shot clock. Unless a written agreement between
the city and the applicant provides otherwise, in the event that Department
staff determines that a permit application is incomplete because it does not
contain all the information, material and/or other documentation required by
this section, Department staff may issue a notice of incomplete application to
the applicant, and the shot clocks set forth above shall be reset or tolled as
set forth in this division.
      (1)   Small wireless facilities.
         (a)   First incomplete notice. Staff shall determine whether an
application is complete or incomplete within ten days of the city’s receipt of
the initial application and shall notify the applicant in writing if the
application is materially incomplete. The notice of incomplete application
shall identify the specific missing information, materials and/or documents,
and the ordinance, rule, statute or regulation creating the obligation to
submit such information, materials and/or documents. The applicable shot clock
date calculation shall re-start at zero on the date that the applicant submits
all the information, materials and documents identified in the notice of
incomplete application to render the application complete.
         (b)   Subsequent incomplete notices. For resubmitted applications
following the initial notice of incomplete application, Department staff will
notify the applicant within ten days of the city’s receipt of the resubmitted
application whether the supplemental submission is complete or incomplete. If
the supplemental submission is incomplete, the notice shall specifically
identify the missing information, materials, and/or documents that must be
submitted based on the Department’s initial incomplete notice. In the case of
any such subsequent notices of incomplete application, the applicable timeframe
for review shall be tolled from the day after the date the city issues the
second or subsequent notice of incomplete application to the applicant until
the applicant submits all the information, materials and documents identified
by the city to render the application complete.
      (2)   Eligible facilities request.
         (a)   First incomplete notice. Staff shall determine whether an
eligible facilities application is complete or incomplete within 30 days of the
city’s receipt of the initial application and shall notify the applicant in
writing if the application is materially incomplete. The notice of incomplete
application shall identify the specific missing information, materials and/or
documents, and the ordinance, rule, statute or regulation creating the
obligation to submit such information, materials and/or documents. The 30-day
shot clock date shall be tolled until the applicant submits all the
information, materials and documents identified in the notice of incomplete
application to render the application complete.
      (b)   Subsequent incomplete notices. For resubmitted applications
following the initial notice of incomplete application, Department staff will
notify the applicant within ten days of the city’s receipt of the resubmitted
application whether the supplemental submission is complete or incomplete. If
the supplemental submission was incomplete, the notice shall specifically
identify the missing information, materials, and/or documents that must be
submitted based on the Department’s initial incomplete notice. In the case of
any such subsequent notices of incomplete application, the applicable timeframe
for review shall be tolled from the day after the date the city issues the
second or subsequent notice of incomplete application to the applicant until
the applicant submits all the information, materials and documents identified
by the city to render the application complete.
   (3)   Major telecommunications facilities.
      (a)   First incomplete notice. Staff shall determine whether an
application is complete or incomplete within 30 days of the city’s receipt of
the initial application and shall notify the applicant in writing if the
application is materially incomplete. The notice of incomplete application
shall identify the specific missing information, materials and/or documents,
and the ordinance, rule, statute or regulation creating the obligation to
submit such information, materials and/or documents. The applicable shot clock
date calculation shall be tolled from the day after the date the city issues
the notice of incomplete application until the applicant submits all the
information, materials and documents identified in the notice of incomplete
application to render the application complete.
      (b)   Subsequent incomplete notices. For resubmitted applications
following the initial notice of incomplete application, Department staff will
notify the applicant within ten days of the city’s receipt of the resubmitted
application whether the supplemental submission is complete or incomplete. If
the supplemental submission is incomplete, the notice shall specifically
identify the missing information, materials, and/or documents that must be
submitted based on the Department’s initial incomplete notice. In the case of
any such subsequent notices of incomplete application, the applicable timeframe
for review shall be tolled from the day after the date the city issues the
second or subsequent notice of incomplete application to the applicant until
the applicant submits all the information, materials and documents identified
by the city to render the application complete.
   (E)   One submittal. The applicant’s response and submission of supplemental
materials and information in response to any notice of incomplete application
must be given to the city in one submittal packet.
   (F)   Determination of shot clock date. The shot clock is determined by
counting forward, beginning on the day after the date when the application was
submitted, by the number of days of the shot clock period identified pursuant
to division (C)(1)(a) or (C)(1)(b) (for small wireless facilities and other
wireless telecommunications facilities excluding eligible facilities) or by the
number of days of the shot clock identified pursuant to division (C)(2)(a) or
(C)(2)(b) (for eligible facilities) and including any pre-application period
asserted by the city; provided, that if the date calculated in this manner is a
holiday, the shot clock date is the next business day after such holiday.
      (1)   For purposes of this division (F), the term HOLIDAY means any of
the following: Saturday, Sunday, any holiday recognized by the city; and any
other day recognized as a holiday by the FCC pursuant to any applicable federal
regulations, orders or rulings of the FCC for the subject wireless
telecommunications facility.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (F), the term BUSINESS DAY means any
day that is not a holiday, as defined in division (F)(1).
   (G)   Withdrawal; extensions of time. To promote efficient review and timely
decisions, any application deemed incomplete must be resubmitted within 180
days after issuance of any notification of incompleteness, or the application
shall be deemed automatically withdrawn. Following the applicant’s request, the
Director may in his or her discretion grant a one-time extension in processing
time to resubmit, not to exceed 150 days. If the application is deemed
automatically withdrawn (and any applicable extension period, if granted, has
expired), a new application (including fees, plans, exhibits, and other

precedence.
   (B)   General guidelines.
      (1)   The applicant shall employ screening and camouflage design
techniques in the design and placement of wireless telecommunications
facilities and wireless telecommunication collocation facilities in order to
ensure that the facility is as visually inconspicuous as possible, to hide the
facility from predominant views from surrounding properties, all in a manner
that achieves compatibility with the community.
      (2)   Screening shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with
surrounding structures using appropriate techniques to camouflage, disguise,
and/or blend into the environment including landscaping, color, and other
techniques to minimize the facility’s visual impact as well as be compatible
with the architectural character of the surrounding buildings or structures in
terms of color, size, proportion, style, and quality.
      (3)   In no event shall the installation of facilities replace or
interfere with parking spaces in such a way as to reduce the total number of
parking spaces below the number that is required.
   (C)   Traffic safety. All facilities shall be designed and located in such a
manner as to avoid adverse impacts on traffic safety.
   (D)   Antennas. The applicant shall use the least visible antennas possible
to accomplish the coverage objectives. Antenna elements shall be flush mounted,
to the extent feasible. All antenna mounts shall be designed so as not to
preclude possible future collocation by the same or other operators or
carriers. Antennas shall be situated as to reduce visual impact without
compromising their function. Whip antennas need not be screened.
   (E)   Building-mounted and roof-mounted facilities. Except as expressly
allowed otherwise by this chapter, building-mounted and roof-mounted facilities
shall be designed and constructed to be fully concealed or screened in a manner
compatible with the existing architecture of the building to which the facility
is mounted in color, texture and type of material. Screening shall not change
the aesthetic character of the building or roof structure to which the facility
is attached or mounted.
   (F)   Facilities mounted to a telecommunications tower.
      (1)   Facilities mounted to a telecommunications tower shall be located
in close proximity to existing above-ground utilities, such as electrical
towers or utility poles (which are not scheduled for removal or under grounding
for at least 18 months after the date of application), light poles, and trees
of comparable heights, and in areas where they will minimize aesthetic impacts.
      (2)   Facilities mounted to a telecommunications tower, including, but
not limited to, the attached antennas, shall be designed to be the minimum
functional height and width required to adequately support the proposed
facility and meet Federal Communications Commission requirements. The applicant
shall provide documentation satisfactory to the Director establishing

cables, shall be run within the interior of the telecommunications tower and
shall be camouflaged or hidden to the fullest extent feasible without
jeopardizing the physical integrity of the tower.
      (4)   Monopole installations shall be situated so as to utilize existing
natural or man- made features including topography, vegetation, buildings, or
other structures to provide the greatest amount of visual screening.
      (5)   All antenna components and accessory wireless equipment shall be
treated with exterior coatings of a color and texture to match the predominant
visual background and/or existing architectural elements so as to visually
blend in with the surrounding development. Subdued colors and non-reflective
materials that blend with surrounding materials and colors shall be used.
      (6)   Monopoles and antennas and similar structures shall be no greater
in diameter or other cross-sectional dimensions than is necessary for the
proper functioning of the facility. The applicant shall provide documentation
satisfactory to the Director establishing compliance with this division.
      (7)   If a faux tree is proposed for the monopole installation (i.e.
monopine, monopalm, etc.), it shall be of a type of tree compatible with those
existing in the immediate areas of the installation. If no trees exist within
the immediate areas, additional landscaping may be required to help integrate
the faux tree into the surrounding area. Additional camouflage of the faux tree
may be required depending on the type and design of faux tree proposed.
   (G)   Accessory equipment. All accessory equipment associated with the
operation of any wireless telecommunications facility or wireless
telecommunications collocation facility shall be fully screened or camouflaged
with stealth elements, and located in a manner to minimize their visibility to
the greatest extent possible utilizing the following methods for the type of
installation:
      (1)   Accessory equipment for building-mounted or roof-mounted facilities
shall be installed inside the building to which it is mounted or underground,
if feasible. If not feasible, such accessory equipment may be located on the
roof of the building that the facility is mounted on, provided that both the
equipment and screening materials are painted the color of the building, roof,
and/or surroundings. All screening materials for roof-mounted facilities shall
be of a quality and design that is architecturally integrated with the design
of the building or structure.
      (2)   Accessory equipment for facilities mounted to a telecommunications
tower shall be visually screened by locating the equipment either within a
nearby building, in an underground vault where feasible (with the exception of
required electrical panels) or in another type of enclosed structure, which
shall comply with the development and design standards of the zoning district
in which the accessory equipment is located. Such enclosed structure shall be
architecturally treated and/or adequately screened from view by landscape
plantings, decorative walls, fencing or other appropriate means, selected so
that the resulting screening will be visually integrated with the architecture
and landscaping of the surroundings.
   (H)   Landscaping. Where appropriate, facilities shall be installed so as to
maintain and enhance existing landscaping on the site, including trees, foliage
and shrubs, whether or not utilized for screening. Additional landscaping shall
be planted where such vegetation is deemed necessary by the city to provide
screening or to block the line of sight between facilities and adjacent uses.
   (I)   Signage. Wireless telecommunications facilities and wireless
telecommunications collocation facilities shall not bear any signs or
advertising devices other than certification, warnings or other signage
required by law or permitted by the city.

requirements for power generators on major wireless facility sites, if the
proposed generator does not meet the criteria for nondiscretionary review of an
emergency standby generator on a macro-cell tower site set forth in §
17.46.210(A)(1) and therefore does not qualify as an emergency standby
generator on a macro-cell tower site under Cal. Gov’t Code § 65850.75.
   (B)   Requirements.
      (1)   Wireless telecommunications facility. No power generator subject to
this section shall be deployed on any major wireless facility site on private
property or on public property outside the PROW unless submitted as part of and
approved in conjunction with an application for the underlying wireless
telecommunications facility on such property.
      (2)   Minor CUP. A minor conditional use permit approved by the
Development Review Committee pursuant to Chapter 17.52 shall be required for
any application to install a power generator on private property or public
property outside the PROW in conjunction with deployment of any major wireless
facility on such property. An application that includes a backup power supply
that qualifies as transmission equipment as part of an eligible facility
request shall be governed by procedures and requirements for eligible
facilities unless the proposal constitutes a substantial change.
         (a)   Fossil fuel generators or other similar noise or odor producing
generators. An applicant who proposes to install a fossil fuel generator or
other similar noise or odor producing generator shall submit information and
documentation to show good cause why the facility cannot feasibly achieve its
power needs with batteries, natural gas powered generators, fuel cells, solar
power or other similarly non-polluting, low noise-level means. As used in this
division (B)(2)(a), the phrase GOOD CAUSE includes commercial impracticability,
actual unavailability, and inability of alternative means to feasibly achieve
the power needs of the facility. The DRC shall include findings on whether the
applicant established good cause in its decision on the proposed minor CUP.
         (b)   Prohibited locations. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, the DRC shall not grant an exception for a fossil fuel generator
or other similar noise or odor producing generator proposed to be located on
private property or public property outside the PROW if such generator would be
within 250 feet of any residence, educational institution or park. The 250-foot
distance shall be measured from the proposed generator to the nearest property
line of the lot on which the residence, educational institution, or park is
located.
      (3)   Compliance with chapter. In addition to the requirements of this
section, power generators shall comply with all other provisions of this
chapter.
      (4)   Other permits. No power generator shall be deployed on any major
wireless facility site subject to this section without approval of all other
ministerial permits required under the code.
      (5)   Construction codes. Compliance with applicable construction codes
and other health and safety standards shall be required as a condition of the
installation, construction or other deployment of any proposed emergency
standby generator for any major wireless facility site subject to this section
as determined by the Director.
      (6)   Leases, licenses and agreements for infrastructure on city property
outside the PROW. In addition to all other requirements of this chapter, the
city may require the execution of a written agreement establishing the
particular terms and provisions under which the city will agree to installation
of a power generator on a major wireless facility site subject to review under
this division.
         (a)   Provisions. The agreement shall include, but not be limited to,
provisions addressing the following: term; rents, fees and costs; inspection
and maintenance requirements; indemnification of the city; insurance
requirements; waiver of monetary damages against the city; removal, restoration
and clean-up requirements; requirement to pay possessory interest taxes, if
any; and such other provisions, terms and conditions deemed necessary and
appropriate by the city based on the application, and consistent with federal
and state law.
         (b)   Additional permits. The agreement shall be in addition to, and
not a substitute, for any other permit required by any provision of this
chapter or code. The agreement shall be fully executed by the city and
applicant prior to the applicant’s submittal of any application for a power
generator on a major wireless facility site under this division or any other
provision of this code. In addition, all ministerial permits shall be obtained
as a condition of the installation, construction or other deployment of any
proposed power generator for any major wireless facility site on private
property or public property outside the PROW in accordance with applicable
construction codes and other health and safety codes.
   (C)   Application content — General requirements. The Director shall develop
permit application forms as the Director deems appropriate based on the
requirements of this section and any city rules and guidelines, and make the
forms available to applicants upon request. An application for the approval of
the installation or modification of a power generator on a major wireless
facility site subject to this section shall be provided by the applicant to the
Director in writing on the city-approved form, and shall include the following
information and documentation, in addition to all other information and
documentation determined necessary by the Director as well as all other
information and documentation required by the city as part of an complete
application for the required permit. The requirements of this section may be
supplemented by rules and guidelines adopted from time to time by the City
Council or Director-implemented supplemental rules, regulations and procedures.
The applicant shall also submit any other application for a minor conditional
use permit and ministerial permit required by this code (such as an
encroachment permit, excavation permit or building permit) concurrent with the
emergency standby generator permit application.
      (1)   One submittal. The application, and all supporting information and
documentation, shall be given to the city in one submittal packet. If the
generator is proposed for a new facility, or a collocation or other
modification to an existing facility, the application and supporting
documentation shall be given to the city in one submittal packet as part of the
underlying facility application.
      (2)   Application contents.
         (a)   The application shall contain all information and documentation
required by §
17.46.210(D)(2); and
         (b)   Proof of property owner consent or authorization for
installation or other deployment of the power generator; and
         (c)   Any other studies, information and/or documentation required by
the rules and guidelines or as otherwise determined necessary by the Director;
and
         (d)   An application and processing fee, a deposit for independent
consultant review, and a deposit for review by the City Attorney’s office, in
an amount set by resolution by the City Council.
   (D)   Additional requirements. The following additional provisions of this
chapter shall apply to applications submitted under this section.
      (1)   Section
17.46.080: Conditions of Approval for All Facilities.
      (2)   Section
17.46.150: Operations and Maintenance Standards.
      (3)   Section
17.46.160: No Dangerous Conditions or Obstructions Allowed.
      (4)   Section
17.46.180: Cessation of Use or Abandonment.
      (5)   Section
17.46.190: Revocation or Modification; Removal.
   (E)   DRC findings. The DRC shall review the application to determine if the
application meets all of the requirements of this section. The DRC shall not
approve the application for the power generator, subject to conditions, unless
the DRC finds that the proposed power generator complies with all requirements
of this section, and also finds that the Director made all findings required
for approval of the underlying wireless telecommunications facility or wireless
telecommunications collocation facility as set forth in §
17.46.090.
(Ord. 2021-10 § 6 (part), 2021)
§ 17.46.230 RULES, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES.
   The City Council may adopt rules, regulations and/or policies by resolution,
to implement and supplement provisions of this chapter. Notwithstanding any
provision of the code to the contrary, all wireless telecommunications
facilities and wireless telecommunications collocation facilities shall comply
with any City Council-adopted rules, regulations or policies.
(Ord. 2021-10 § 6 (part), 2021)
§ 17.46.240 EFFECT ON OTHER ORDINANCES.
   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not relieve a person
from complying with any other applicable provision of this code. In the event
of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and other provisions of
this code, this chapter shall control.
(Ord. 2021-10 § 6 (part), 2021)
§ 17.46.250 EFFECT OF STATE OR FEDERAL LAW.
   (A)   In the event it is determined by the City Attorney that state or
federal law prohibits discretionary permitting requirements for certain
wireless telecommunications facilities, or wireless telecommunications
collocation facilities, the permits required by this chapter for those
facilities shall be deemed to be ministerial permits. Such a determination by
the City Attorney shall be in writing with citations to legal authority and
shall be a public record. For those facilities, in lieu of an administrative
review, minor conditional use permit (mCUP) or a conditional use permit, a
ministerial permit shall be required prior to installation or modification of a
wireless telecommunications facility or a wireless telecommunications
collocation facility, and all provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to
any such facility with the exception that the required permit shall be reviewed
and administered as a ministerial permit by the Director rather than as a
discretionary permit. Any conditions of approval set forth in this chapter or
deemed necessary by the Director shall be imposed and administered as
reasonable time, place and manner rules.
   (B)   If subsequent to the issuance of the City Attorney’s written
determination pursuant to division (A) above, the City Attorney determines that
the law has changed and that discretionary permitting is permissible, the City
Attorney shall issue such determination in writing with citations to legal
authority and all discretionary permitting requirements shall be reinstated.
The City Attorney’s written determination shall be a public record.

CHAPTER 17.48
NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
Sections:
   
17.48.010   Intent.
   
17.48.020   Nonconforming uses.
   
17.48.030   Nonconforming structures.
   
17.48.040   Repairs and maintenance.
   
17.48.050   Nonconformity resulting from change in density regulations.
   
17.48.060   Loss of legal nonconforming status.
   
17.48.070   Nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities and wireless
telecommunications collocation facilities.
§ 17.48.010 INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to permit nonconforming uses and structures to
continue until they are removed, restricted or abandoned, but not to encourage
their survival. Nonconforming uses and structures are hereby declared to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the same district. Nonconforming uses and
structures shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, except as
expressly provided herein, nor shall the existence of a nonconforming use or
structure be grounds for adding other uses or structures prohibited in the same
district.
(`83 Code, § 17.48.010) (Ord. 94-03 § 6, 1994)
§ 17.48.020 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A nonconforming use may be continued so long as it is in compliance with all
laws other than the use regulations in this Title 17, subject to the following
provisions:
   (A)   It may not be enlarged, extended, moved or altered, except to change
the use of a structure or land to a use permitted in the district in which it
is located.
   (B)   It may be extended throughout any part of the structure which was
originally approved for such use, but it may not be extended to occupy land
outside such structure.
   (C)   In the case of a nonconforming use of land not involving a structure,
the use may not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or
parcel on which it is located other than that occupied by the use at the time
it became nonconforming.
   (D)   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the
Development Review Committee finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate
or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In
permitting such change, the Development Review Committee may impose conditions
to ensure that the degree of nonconformity is not thereafter increased, along
with such other conditions as are necessary to mitigate any adverse impacts of
the changed use upon neighboring properties.
   (E)   If a nonconforming use of a structure or land is superseded by a
permitted use, such use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district, and the nonconforming use may not be resumed.
   (F)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or land is discontinued or
abandoned for a continuous period of 180 days or more, any subsequent use shall
conform to the regulations of the district in which the property is located.
   (G)   Nonconforming uses in the HCD zone may be expanded as set forth in §
17.08.020(D).
(`83 Code, § 17.48.020) (Ord. 94-03 § 6, 1994)
§ 17.48.030 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming structure may be continued in use so long as it is in
compliance with all laws other than the structural regulations of this Title
17, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   It may not be enlarged, expanded or altered in any way which increases
its nonconformity, but may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (B)   Should a nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its
reasonable replacement value at the time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of his title; provided,
however, that a nonconforming structure used for residential purposes may be
reconstructed in any residential zone or planned development zone designated
for residential development if it meets all building and safety regulations;
and provided further, that to the extent reasonable and feasible the
construction shall conform to the regulations of this title as determined by
the Development Review Committee.
   (C)   When an additional dwelling unit is added to a property in a zone
permitting multi-family development, all structures on the property shall meet
all building and safety regulations; and further, to the extent reasonable and
feasible, all existing structures shall be brought into conformity to the
regulations of this title as determined by the Committee or Commission.
   (D)   If a structure is moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located.
   (E)   If use of a nonconforming use is maintained in a nonconforming
structure, the provisions of this section and §
17.48.020 shall apply, provided that where a conflict between said sections
exists, the more restrictive provision shall govern.
   (F)   When a nonconforming structure is abandoned or vacated for a
continuous period of 180 days or more, any subsequent use of the property shall
conform to the regulations of the district in which the property is located.
(`83 Code, § 17.48.030) (Ord. 94-03 § 6, 1994; Ord. 2004-11 § 13, 2004)
§ 17.48.040 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure, or on any conforming structure containing a
nonconforming use, routine maintenance work may be performed, or repair or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may take place,
provided that the value of repair or replacement work during any 12-month
period shall not exceed 10% of the replacement cost of the whole structure, and
provided further that the square footage of the structure, whether conforming
or nonconforming, shall not be increased.
(`83 Code, § 17.48.040) (Ord. 94-03 § 6, 1994)
§ 17.48.050 NONCONFORMITY RESULTING FROM CHANGE IN DENSITY REGULATIONS.
   Where a lawful use of a structure and land in combination is rendered
nonconforming solely by reason of a change in the density allowed on the
property, nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the enlargement, extension,
reconstruction or structural alteration of one or more structures on the
property, provided:
   (A)   Such work shall only be allowed on that number of structures then
permitted in the district in which the property is located.
   (B)   Approval of such work shall be obtained from the Development Review
Committee, which shall review the site plan and other pertinent information to
ensure that all other applicable provisions of this code are satisfied and that
no new nonconformity will be created.
   (C)   A covenant describing the structure or structures for which work has
been approved shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
   (D)   Once work is done on that number of structures then permitted on the
premises, no work shall be approved by the Development Review Committee for any
other structure on the premises.
(`83 Code, § 17.48.050) (Ord. 94-03 § 6, 1994)
§ 17.48.060 LOSS OF LEGAL NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   (A)   The right to continue a nonconforming use shall terminate when it is
determined to be a public nuisance by resolution of the City Council pursuant
to the procedures provided in
Chapter 8.12 of this code or order of a court of competent jurisdiction and the
nuisance is not abated in the manner and within the time stated in the
resolution of the City Council or order of the court. In addition to the
specific grounds for finding a nuisance as set forth in
Chapter 8.12, a nonconforming use is a public nuisance if:
      (1)   The use interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or
property in the neighborhood; or
      (2)   The use is a business establishment which permits persons to
congregate for unreasonably long time periods in parking areas and/or
pedestrian walkways resulting in unreasonable noise levels in residential areas
during the hours of 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., or resulting in said persons
obstructing or interfering with the free passageway in said parking areas or on
said pedestrian walkways, or which becomes a place where an unreasonable number
of violations of
Chapter 9.12 of this code (relating to public consumption of alcoholic
beverages) occur; or
      (3)   The use is injurious to the health of persons in the neighborhood.
   (B)   Where a use has been declared a public nuisance and is nonconforming
solely because of the lack of a conditional use permit, the City Council may
allow the property owner to apply for a conditional use permit from the
Planning Commission pursuant to
Chapter 17.52 of this code. If the conditional use of the nuisance requires
demolition of the structure, the resolution, judgment or order shall find that
in fairness and in justice there is no other way reasonably to correct the
nuisance other than by demolition of the structure.
   (C)   The right to continue the use of a nonconforming structure shall
terminate when the structure and/or the parcel on which it is located in is
determined to be a public nuisance by resolution of the City Council adopted
pursuant to Chapter 8.12 of this code, or by judgment or order of a court of
competent jurisdiction and the nuisance is not abated in the manner and within
the time stated in the resolution of the City Council or order of the court. If
the abatement of the nuisance requires demolition of the structure the
resolution, judgement or order shall find that in fairness and in justice there
is no other way reasonably to correct the nuisance other than by demolition of
the structure.
   (D)   Where it cannot be found that demolition of a structure is
appropriate, the Council shall permit the structure to remain in existence, but
may impose one or more conditions to bring the structure into conformity with
the requirements of this title so far as is reasonable in addition to any other
conditions necessary to abate the public nuisance.
   (E)   The City Council's determination pursuant to this section may be made
as part of the hearing held pursuant to
Chapter 8.12, or it may be made separately following a hearing pursuant to
Chapter 8.12, provided that in either case the determination shall be preceded
by a public hearing, notice of which shall be given pursuant to the provisions
of §
17.52.320.
(`83 Code, § 17.48.060) (Ord. 94-03 § 6, 1994)
§ 17.48.070 NONCONFORMING WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES AND WIRELESS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COLLOCATION FACILITIES.
   (A)   Any wireless telecommunication facility or wireless telecommunications
collocation facility that was lawfully constructed prior to June 18, 2011,
which does not comply with the standards, regulations and/or requirements of
Chapter 17.46, shall be deemed a nonconforming structure.
   (B)   A nonconforming wireless telecommunications facility or nonconforming
wireless telecommunications collocation facility may be continued in use so
long as it is in compliance with all laws other than the regulations of this
Title 17, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities and wireless
telecommunications collocation facilities shall, within ten years from the date
such facility becomes nonconforming, bring the facility into conformity with
all requirements of this Title 17; provided, however, that should the owner
desire to expand or modify the facility, or make some other change in excess of
that permitted pursuant to §
17.48.040, the owner shall comply with all applicable provisions of this code
at such time.
      (2)   When a nonconforming wireless telecommunications facility or
wireless telecommunications collocation facility is abandoned or vacated for a
continuous period of 90 days or more, such facility shall conform to the
regulations of the district in which the property is located or shall be
removed in accordance with
Chapter 17.46 of this code if it cannot be made to conform.
      (3)   An aggrieved person may file an appeal to the City Council of any
decision of the Director made pursuant to this section. In the event of an
appeal alleging that the ten-year amortization period is not reasonable as
applied to a particular property, the City Council may consider the amount of
investment or original cost, present actual or depreciated value, dates of
construction, amortization for tax purposes, salvage value, remaining useful
life, the length and remaining term of the lease under which it is maintained
(if any), and the harm to the public if the structure remains standing beyond
the prescribed amortization period, and set an amortization period accordingly
for the specific property.

   Subject to the provisions of the state Planning and Zoning Law, proceedings
to change zones or uses within zones, to alter boundaries of zones, to impose
regulations not heretofore imposed, and to remove or modify any regulation
heretofore imposed may be initiated and conducted in the following manner:
   (A)   Motion of the Council on its own initiative;
   (B)   By motion of the Commission on its own initiative;
   (C)   By filing with the Commission of an application by the owner(s) of
record of the parcel(s) of property for which a change is sought, or by a
purchaser thereof under a contract in writing, duly executed and acknowledged
by both the buyer and the seller, by a lessee in possession thereof with the
written consent of the owner(s) or by the agency of any of the foregoing, duly
authorized thereto in writing.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no amendment to the
General Plan, any applicable specific plan, or this code that would result in a
redesignation of property designated as Hillside Wilderness Preserve (HWP) for
non-HWP uses or Hillside Recreation (HR) for non-HR uses shall be effective for
any purpose unless such amendment is first approved by the voters of the city.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no amendment to the

§ 17.52.327 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish an appropriate
review process for making reasonable accommodations in zoning and land use
laws, regulations, policies or procedures, when necessary to afford individuals
with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, while
minimizing potential impacts on neighboring properties.
   (B)   Definition.
      REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. A deviation that provides a person with a
disability relief from, and flexibility in, the application of the city's
zoning, building, and land use laws, regulations, policies or procedures, which
is necessary to provide a person with a disability an equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling.
   (C)   Application.
      (1)   Applications for reasonable accommodation shall be made to the
Department of Community Development in writing, and shall contain such
information as may be specified by the Director.
      (2)   A uniform fee set by Council resolution shall be paid to the city
upon the filing of each application.
      (3)   Requests must demonstrate a clear nexus between the request and a
disability. It is the applicant's responsibility to describe the connection
between the disability and the reasonable accommodation requested by the
applicant, and the application shall include:
         (a)   The specific code section, regulation, procedure, or policy of
the city from which relief is sought;
         (b)   A site plan or illustrative drawing showing the proposed
accommodation, if applicable;
         (c)   An explanation of why the specified code section, regulation,
procedure, or policy is denying, or will deny a person with a disability equal
opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling;
         (d)   The basis for the claim that the fair housing laws apply to the
applicant and evidence satisfactory to the Director supporting the claim, which
may include a letter from a medical doctor or other licensed health care
professional, a disabled license, or any other appropriate evidence;
         (e)   A detailed explanation of why the accommodation is reasonable
and necessary to afford the person with the disability an equal opportunity to
use and enjoy the dwelling; and
         (f)   Any other information required to make the findings required by
§
17.52.327(E), consistent with the fair housing laws.
      (4)   When an application is made, the city may engage in an interactive
process with the applicant to devise alternative accommodations that provide
the applicant with an opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, where such
alternative accommodations would reduce impacts to neighboring properties and
residents or the surrounding area.
   (D)   Review process.
      (1)   (a)   The Director of Community Development shall have the
authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation.
Alternatively, the Director of Community Development may refer the application
to the Development Review Committee for an administrative review and
determination.
         (b)   Applications referred to the Development Review Committee may
include, but are not limited to, requests that could result in a physical
modification to the property that cannot be easily restored or terminated after
the reasonable accommodation is no longer needed and may cause a significant
adverse impact on an adjacent property. Notice of the public meeting for
applications that are referred to the Development Review Committee shall be
mailed at least ten days prior to the meeting to all owners of real property
abutting the subject site, utilizing the records of the County Assessor.
      (2)   Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted concurrently with
another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the hearing
body having the review authority over the discretionary land use application.
      (3)   The review and determination of requests for reasonable
accommodation shall be based on the ability to make the required findings as
set forth in §
17.52.327(E).
   (E)   Findings. A request for a reasonable accommodation shall be approved,
with or without conditions, if the reviewing authority finds that all of the
following findings can be made:
      (1)   That the dwelling, which is the subject of the request for
reasonable accommodation, shall be used by an individual with a disability who
is protected under state or federal fair housing laws.
      (2)   That the requested accommodation is necessary to afford an
individual with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
      (3)   That the requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial
or administrative burden on the city.
      (4)   That the requested accommodation will not require a fundamental
alteration to the city's zoning, building, or land use laws, regulations,
policies and/or procedures.
   (F)   Decision. A request for reasonable accommodation may be approved,
approved with conditions, or denied in accordance with the findings set forth
in §
17.52.327(E).
      (1)   The reviewing authority shall set forth the findings and any
conditions of approval in a written decision, which shall be sent to the
applicant.
      (2)   In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing
authority may impose conditions to ensure that the reasonable accommodation
complies with the findings required by this section. Conditions also may be
imposed to ensure that any removable structures or physical design features
that are constructed or installed in association with the reasonable
accommodation request shall be removed once those structures or physical design
features are no longer necessary to accommodate a person with a disability or
to reduce impacts upon neighboring properties.
      (3)   The decision of the Director of Community Development shall be
